                    So, I can say that a story's about something, like Little Red Riding Hood is a euphemism for a young women getting her menses, and the Wolf is a euphemism for a predatory man.  <br/><br/>What are games about?  <br/>How does... Apocalypse World show this?                  </div>

                            Much like stories (although perhaps to a far greater extent), games can be more or less "about" something. Some games say precious little in terms of what they stand for and what they mean. Others say a great deal.<br/><br/>Lots of people have written a fair bit on "what <i>Apocalypse World</i> is about", for instance. Not so many have written what <i>Fudge</i> is about, in comparison.                        </div>

                            In his book <i>Persuasive Games</i>, Ian Bogost talks about a concept called <b>procedural rhetoric</b>; like verbal and visual rhetoric, it's the idea that one makes arguments through the use of procedures. I think it's something that's heavily at play in most non-abstract games (that is, any game where the elements involved in play can reasonably be said to correspond to objects or concepts that exist outside of the game), and a huge part of how roleplaying games produce meaning.<br/><br/>The procedures we follow when playing games make claims about all sorts of things: about how much it hurts to get shot in the leg, about what you can expect from being more or less attractive than average, about the benefits of fostering positive relationships with other people, about how characters' flaws shape the stories they participate in, about when uncertainty serves to create dramatic tension, etc...<br/><br/>So the way that overall meaning in games is constructed is through an arrangement of statements like, "These things are like this," and "Doing this produces this result," "A corresponds to B in these ways," and such. There's still a necessary level of subjective interpretation that needs to be done on the final arrangement of those statements, and different kinds of procedures can be more or less geared towards being easily interpreted.<br/><br/>But just like words themselves generally mean very little on their own, constructing significant amounts of meaning often requires stringing lots of these procedures together, and what they ultimately mean is highly dependent on which ones are present and how they relate to each other. Like, the rules for alignment don't really mean all that much when they're just sitting in the rulebook (though they do, I think, make strong suggestions about what they might be used to mean, particularly when we take a holistic look at their appearance in the rules), compared to when (and why and on whom) the Paladin actually uses Smite Evil.                        </div>

                            I don't really understand the question - are you really just asking about how a game carries meaning?<br/><br/>If so, I like the way Yukamichi breaks it down - roleplaying games carry narrative messages, but they also carry meaning in their structures, so it's in a sense a wider and more varied medium than storytelling.<br/><br/>As for how we can perceive that meaning - how is it possible to tell what a game is about - I'd say that it's no different from the way we evaluate e.g. novels: you just have to experience the thing, understand it and then verbalize that understanding. As we know from general art theory, the work in itself is not about anything per se, but it is possible for it to be pretty consistent about producing a similar understanding for many different people; this understanding is what we usually mean when we say that something is "about" something else. The meaning is not inherent to the pattern, but neither is it independent; you need both the work and the audience to have the meaning emerge in the audience's understanding of the work.                        </div>

                            Thanks for your replies, but you're both dodging the question, which is maybe understandable?  <br/><br/>I get that rpgs have little things that when combined hopefully create meaning past their content.  Like, they become contextualized through play, but not really all that often.  I mean, who are we kidding, right?  I mean, yes, I've at times, been emotionally moved by playing a game, but the game part is not that involved in it.  I mean, it's a character sheet, most of the time, blankly staring back at me.  It's not that involved, the game part.  The people around the table, perhaps, and hopefully moreso.  <br/>The buy-in is super involved.  The game...eh it's there, doing what games do... mostly.<br/><br/>I think with the somewhat better games, you can kinda answer this.  Like, Paranoia.  <br/>But I think Paranoia, is kinda in the minority.  <br/><br/>I'm not asking about content, I'm asking about context.  Again, I understand that something like rules, lead to a form of context, like "if-that-than-this" type of thing.  <br/>We hopefully use rules to create context, but I'm just saying that I don't see it happen all that much.  The context surely isn't very clear.  I mean, it's why when you ask someone what the D&amp;D game was about last week, they just describe what happened, not "what it was about", the theme.<br/><br/><br/> </div>

                            I don't think I understand what you mean. Could you give us an example of what some game is about in your mind, or how a given game is clearly not about anything? I understand your initial example about the fairy tale <i>Red Riding Hood</i>, and how you can verbalize its theme, but I don't see how that can be compared to games.<br/><br/>Maybe you've just been encountering remarkably meaningless play recently? I certainly have seen a lot of that over time, but not nearly enough as to conclude that it's a property of the rpg form.<br/><br/>Our D&amp;D session last Monday was about five things:<br/><b>*</b> Getting to know the <i>Chronicles of Prydain</i> and its background in Celtic folklore. This is a long-term process, it didn't happen all at once during that one session.<br/><b>*</b>Learning 4th edition D&amp;D; most of the group don't have prior experience, so everything from skill challenges to magic item purchasing came as more or less welcome revelations.<br/><b>*</b> Trying out our assortment of techniques for playing an engaging action scene with miniatures and battlemap. This was the first real combat scene in the campaign so far, so there was a lot of "about" in there: seeing how the numbers unfolded into action was quite entertaining.<br/><b>*</b> Learning to play together, with this specific game. Not only are some players new to me, but everybody also needs to find their place in a game that has a structure unlike those we've played in the past. All kinds of interactions starting with basics like "what am I allowed to say and when" are new, and therefore doing even simple things successfully is exciting.<br/><b>*</b> An evil trapper driven insane by grief gave the heroes a hard time on the battlefield, which became the meat of the session. This had thematic connotations in terms of storytelling, but mostly we were amused by the effectiveness with which a dense forest and a tricky trap-maker combined to give a seemingly harmless old man a pretty respectable danger level. The tactical high point of the combat was when one of the heroes climbed out of a pit trap (with spikes, of course) only to position himself in such a manner that the trapper, suddenly appearing from the brush, could simply <i>push him back in</i> for another round of trap damage.<br/><br/>That pretty much covers it. I don't think that this session was in any way exceptional - we're always doing stuff at the game table and the play is always "about" something. Very often it is an "about" that is directly derived from some game text or other. It's really not hard, if you want to name a game text I can tell you what it's about.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" rel="nofollow">Nathan_H</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>How does... Apocalypse World show this?  </p></div></blockquote>
It shows it in play, ultimately. Game texts do not traditionally include a careful exegesis of what they mean in the game text itself. Rather, you're expected to study the text to learn how to execute the ritual, and then you do the ritual, and at the end you have had an experience that you can assign meaning to.<br/><br/>In the case of <i>Apocalypse World</i> I would expect the experience of play to often involve stories that include themes like questioning the value of the modern world, emphasizing universal qualities of human existence in a post-apocalyptic world, showing what kind of world people might make given the chance...<br/><br/>Finally: what do you think of Ron Edwards's theory of Narrativism (the idea about story games not having themes, but rather Premises that only become themes through play), and does that pertain at all to what you're asking about? Does it answer the question?                        </div>

                            I think there are two ways a game can be "about" something, in the literary sense you're using to analyze <i>Little Red Riding Hood</i>.<br/><br/>The first way is just like a story:<br/><br/>You sit down and you play through the game, creating a story. That story may have themes, subjects, morals, and so forth, just like any story. <br/><br/>You might say, "We played <i>Archipelago</i> last night. My character was a young woman, who tried to escape from a wolf. Clearly, the wolf was a metaphor for a predatory man."<br/><br/>The second way is via fictional content, fictional and procedural constraints, and play procedures.<br/><br/>The game might be said to make statements about the people playing, the way they engage with roleplaying and with each other, and the fictional material.<br/><br/>For instance, if I write a game where the only way to win is to lie to your friends, we could say that my game is, at some level, "about" lying, uncovering lies, or something similar. (Given a specific game, we can talk about this in some more detail; in the abstract it sounds very vague, but with an actual game we can get to a more specific formulation.)<br/><br/>The relationship of the way the game tells the participants to interact with each other and the rules for what happens in the fiction all limit the scope of stories which may be told, and that implies (or even forces) themes to emerge.<br/><br/>For instance, in D&amp;D, stories which recreate aspects of the Hero's Journey are part of the fabric of the design. If you wanted to tell stories about hubris and how the once mighty all fall, with the characters being aging heroes fighting a hopeless battle as their skills and abilities degrade... you wouldn't be able to do that without redesigning the game.<br/><br/>As another <i>Monsterhearts</i> gives the characters a limited palette of abusive, manipulative, or coercive ways to gain and exert influence over each other. In this sense, it's often said to be "about" dysfunctional relationships. However, it also tells us to create teenage characters with monstrous aspects which exaggerate young peoples' feelings of alienation, angst, anger, and similar "teenage" problems. The MC is instructed to make "all acceptance conditional"; between these various design elements you end up with a game which is clearly about teenagers struggling with their identity and treating each in dysfunctional ways. The game is "about" the high school experience, told through a metaphor of monsters and body horror.<br/><br/>Many of the specifics (especially the "sex moves") make strong statements about the nature of sex and teen relationships, much in the same way as <i>Little Riding Hood</i>. For instance, the Mortal's sex move tells us that, at least for this character, consummating love is a self-destructive thing and the person you trust will inevitably turn into a monster (and probably hurt you).<br/><br/>However, the game also shows us an inevitable avenue for hope: play long enough, and the PCs will gain "growing up moves", which allow them to create functional relationships for the first time. There's a strong and clear theme in there, as well. <br/><br/>All these things constrain the kinds of stories we can tell. When the rules and procedures constrain the fiction sufficiently to create stories which reliably produce these themes, we can say that a game is "about" those themes, much like <i>Little Red Riding Hood</i>.                        </div>

                            Eero,<br/><br/>I don't see that premise-becoming-theme thing happen all that much in play, and I've played some great games, with some great game players.  I mean, I've had hints of slivers of theme, but nothing like story is capable of.  <br/>I mean, games can barely tell jokes, which are really simple stories.<br/>I guess, I agree with Ron that games, including of the rpg variety, don't have themes, in the literary sense.<br/>But, I kinda think Paranoia does?  <br/>I don't think D&amp;D has one,  beyond a sort of subconscious greed.  D&amp;D would probably be better with a clearer Press-Your-Luck mechanism.  If it clarified the whole risk/reward thing.  I'm sure those mini-dungeon-themed dice/card games do something like that?<br/><br/>Paul, <br/><br/>Your first way, I have never played that way.  The theme in hindsight way.  I imagine it exists through some sort of Jungian examination, but I think it's a rare beast.<br/><br/>Lying in games, isn't like lying in lies(stories).  I've played in games where lying is rewarded, and the premise, isn't usually about lying, but the context for those lies.<br/><br/>I don't think D&amp;D comes anywhere close to the Hero's Journey.  It's got a rise to power and complexity, that hopefully follows a players learning curve.  That's about it.  I don't even think it addresses the necessary lack of, that you'd need as contrast, if it were a story.  Like if D&amp;D is really about the a rise in power, you'd think it would focus a bit more on the making do without, or the struggle.  But struggle in game is a tightrope walk.<br/><br/>In Monsterhearts, how long does it take for these "growing-up" moves to come into play, because they seem like something that would approach theme.  That revisiting of oneself, with a different perspective.<br/>I'm 43, I've not wanted to revisit my teenage years, so I've steered clear of Monsterhearts.    <br/><br/>I think the closest role-playing games can get to story is facts, or perhaps history.  It's because games abstract the human experience, with a greater degree of removal, than facts or story do.<br/><br/>I think the game Hide &amp; Seek has a proto-theme.  I think it's an almost perfect game.   Maybe because it's not throwing a whole lot of story at you?  I have no clue why Hide &amp; Seek works.  I mean, yes it plays into fear, and it's not asking for us to behave in a nuanced way, just fearful and/or sneaky.                          </div>

                            So we're interested in theme specifically, and how games don't have a literary theme? There's other sorts of about-ness in the world as well, but that does narrow it down a lot.<br/><br/>I pretty much agree on that point - games are about many things, and different games are different, but a literary theme is not even the most common thing for a game to be about. Taken as a whole over the entire field of rpgs one could say that roleplaying games don't have a theme, any more than football does.<br/><br/>There are a whole bunch of games that indeed have a "proto-theme", a premise that the game invites the players to explore. If that doesn't turn into a theme, the fault could be in the game, or it could be in the players - I have certainly seen people play games about some blindingly obvious topics, and failing to produce a story that has a theme. <i>Zombie Cinema</i>, for instance: as wacky as it seems, about 10% of the people who try it seem to be able to play it through without noticing that the game invites them to depict and judge human morality in a crisis situation. For those players Zombie Cinema can truly be said to be about nothing at all, as there really isn't much left of it once you discard that basic premise. A bit of dice rolling and menacing growls, that's it.<br/><br/>Furthermore, there are even games that do have a literary theme baked in, precisely as much of a one as a fairy tale does. <i>Paranoia</i> was already mentioned, it doesn't exactly shy away from its literary theming. <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> is another example. <i>Exalted</i> counts as well, and so does <i>Pendragon</i>. <i>Dread</i>, <i>Dead of Night</i>, <i>Puppetland</i>, most superhero games... Any games that have their own in-built story that comes up strongly in play count in this regard, I think. <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> is one of those games that might count or not: its story is in most editions indubitably one-note and very clear, but it is also very realistic to play it while ignoring that story, so any given play-through may be narratively independent (telling about something else) or narratively meaningless.<br/><br/>But those exceptions aside, yeah - lots of games out there that don't have a literary theme, or that theme is very secondary to what goes on in the game. <i>Apocalypse World</i> definitely included - it's a carefully constructed narrativist game; those aren't supposed to push their own themes.<br/><br/>Also, my own experience about that premise-turning-into-theme thing: while you say that it's rare and barely perceptible, my experience is that I'll get it over 90% of the time when playing a game designed for it. The afore-mentioned Zombie Cinema, for instance: give me good players and it's gonna be 100% of the time, until we grow bored of doing it. I don't know if our difference on this is because of different play experiences or a difference in how we interpret theme out of a story - could be that you require the theme to be presented very explicitly before you acknowledge its presence in a story?                        </div>

                            I think any RPG is "about" the feedback its system provides, most so on the largest scale at which that happens.<br/><br/>Call of Cthulhu is about how seeking and seeing supernatural horror leads to madness or death.  The mechanics (a) for when you lose Sanity and (b) for how outclassed you are in combat against monsters, both show this.<br/><br/>D&amp;D is about how troubleshooting and overcoming physical danger is the path to personal betterment.  The system for how you get and spend XP shows this.                        </div>

                            It might help to see games as a grouping of stories. Like, maybe Game X isn't "Little Red Riding Hood". Maybe Game X is "all morality-based fairy tales for young children in medieval Europe". <br/><br/>A given session or campaign might be more accurately compared with a short story; the game text itself might be more like a collection or a genre.                        </div>

                            I'm not sure I need help, or to phrase it differently, I'm not sure it would help anyone seeing role-playing games as groups of stories, because they aren't even stories, so why see them as many, when they aren't even one?  <br/>There's maybe as much a story, as a really bad story, without a theme. Like facts.  I'm sure there's stories without themes, but I imagine we don't like them, but who knows?  John Waters can get enjoyment from a bad movie by looking at it's decorum.  I'm not saying people can't like, or shouldn't like what I might consider bad stories, I'm just saying that role-playing games, for the most part, lack theme.  I've not played every game, so maybe one would change my mind?  Maybe I'm totally wrong?<br/><br/>Paul, your first sentence.  I don't mean to be singling you out, but no.  I have never played what felt like a fairy tale, let alone several tales that tied into a theme.  It would probably feel too restrictive for a game?  Maybe M<br/><br/>I'm fine with games not being stories, or whatever you wanna call role=playing games that won't offend anyone.<br/><br/>And David, I have a slight problem with your use of "personal betterment" , because it's never felt like that in all my wasted hours playing D&amp;D.  I'm joking about the wasted hours, but not about the feeling of personal betterment.  For it to be about personal betterment, you've got to show failed attempts, and D&amp;D just gives gifts through grinding.  It's not like Power Stunts in Marvel Super Heroes.  In D&amp;D, one day you can't do a thing - CAN'T EVEN ATTEMPT A THING, next day VOILA (insert whatever trinket they throw at ya)!                          </div>

                            Yeah, "personal betterment" was kinda vague.  I don't have the perfect words for what I meant.  It's like this: <i>before</i>, storming the dragon's lair for the glory and plunder therein was not a good option for you, for you would surely have died.  But <i>now</i>, after all the lesser dangers you've overcome, the dragon lair is <i>not</i> a death sentence for you.<br/><br/>So you become someone who can face tougher challenges.  That's what I meant by "personal betterment".<br/><br/>If there is no concept that dragon caves exist (or other things that'd be a good challenge for high-level characters and instant death for low-level characters), then my formulation fails, but I don't think I've ever played D&amp;D in that scenario.<br/><br/>Nathan, more generally, what's your take on my impression of what games are about?<br/><br/>I don't know if "overcome danger to get better at overcoming tougher dangers" is what you meant by "about", but I do think there's a highly relevant overlap between (a) the space the game's reward system creates and (b) what players actually do with it, and whatever meaning emerges from that.                        </div>

                            I see RPG settings as allegories of real world situations; they have obvious relationships to the real world, but they still have their own internal logic and existence.  Like archetypes in Jungian psychology, they're not just flat symbols are that deployed to prove an abstract point.  (See also Tolkein on Grendel)<br/><br/>So you can say that Apocalypse World is about living in a society that's fatally broken and how that reduces the people in it into hungry Darwinian stereotypes of themselves, but at the same time Jones the Brainer is a real guy who can't understand why nobody likes him when he's always so helpful and friendly.                         </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">@Nathan_H</a> Can I sincerely ask "who cares?"  <br/><br/>IMO, The purpose of interactive fiction is not to <i>produce</i> a story, it is to <i>participate</i> in a story.  It is the quality of the participation, rather than the quality of the subjective result that is important, the same as any other type of game.  A basketball video game isn’t judged by how much like a real game of basketball it appears, its judged by how much fun it is to play.<br/><br/> </div>

Well, um because I'm asking this question on an internet forum, somewhat devoted to role-playing games, me.

So you only think there's one way to judge a game?  Of course, I think your hypothetical basketball game could, and likely would be judged on it's basketball-ness, and that includes how much it feels, and looks like basketball.  <br/><br/>

I don't think rpgs offer much when it comes to theme.  When I use the word "theme", I mean it like in fiction.  I'm just curious why this is?  Is theme too limiting for game players?  Is game too lateral to show the full circle of something.  Do LARPs handle theme better than tabletop role-playing?  Why maybe is that?  Or isn't that?  <br/><br/>Oh, and I don't think games are <i>about</i> as much as they just are, or not nudge-nudge about something.  There are a handful of games that are nudge-nudge about something.  I think D&amp;D is a weird, psychosexual exploration, into mysterious vaginas, while fighting off giant penises.  D&amp;D is about a lot of things, but the narrative that develops doesn't feel like a story.  It feels like news.<br/><br/><br/>I'm not sure how rewarding of a thing this was?  <br/>Thanks to all of you, that took the time to type something.<br/><br/> </div>

                            Well, a lot of the Forge stuff was specifically aimed at creating games that were about something, or in Forge-speak, facilitated a "Story Now" (Narrativist) creative agenda and focused on <i>addressing theme</i>.<br/><br/>The Forge did this because a lot of players wanted that kind of play, and the RPGs in their toolbox weren't terribly good at reliably producing it. You <i>can</i> address theme in D&amp;D, but eventually the reward structure makes it really hard to keep doing that. It's hard to play <i>Sorcerer</i> or <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> or <i>My Life with Master</i> or <i>carry: a game about war</i> without addressing theme, though. Like, super really hard.                        </div>

Hypothetically speaking, I could imagine there's a fairly robust argument to be made that the influence of unpredictability and/or openness can do a lot to stifle attempts at literary thematics, or at least a top-down attempt to impose them on a game. Some, but certainly not all, LARPs are often more "scripted" or "controlled" than many other sorts of games, which could open up more opportunity to hammer home a theme than games that are more open-ended.<br/><br/>That being said, I personally think that that openness is to at least some extent an illusion, no matter how much people try to tout it as a major feature of roleplaying games, and I also think that there's more theme going on in games than you're trying to argue in this thread, but I don't really know how to convince you of that, or if it's even something worth attempting. <br/><br/>I think that a lot of games at least strive for themes, even if they are usually vague about what those themes are, and a lot of times, particularly with "story games," people's sense of having "played the game wrong" can at least in part be an acknowledged failure to use the tools the game provides to manifest those themes through play.                        </div>
