I don't mean you <i>should</i> play it freeform.<br/><br/>I mean that the creative and social agreements and understandings and habits and processes which support freeform need to be there.<br/><br/>I am not sure if this is true.  But it strikes me that it might be.  And if it is, that gives us some interesting ways to view rules.  Not from a design perspective, but from a participant perspective.  Once you're able to play a game freeform, then rules can be:<br/>- reminders<br/>- shortcuts<br/>- inspiration<br/>- chance arbitration<br/>- channels for expression<br/>- more stuff that isn't at the tip of my brain<br/>- a sort of second game on top of the freeform game<br/>- optional<br/><br/>This is sort of the way RPG rules have been traditionally used.  Sometimes that goes great, and sometimes not.  Maybe success and failure are less about the actual rules being used in this optional or supporting paradigm, and more about the freeform-supporting structures beneath them?<br/><br/>I'm not just saying "system (the <i>whole</i> system, including soft skills and social stuff) matters" -- I think it's a little more specific than that.  I think maybe it's the case that:<br/>- no ruleset will ever provide a group everything they need<br/>- every group will always do some of their own work to optimize play for them<br/>- when you're doing your own play-optimizing work, looking at rules as optional tools for that larger endeavor is <i>natural</i>, and independent of how "good" or "bad" the rules are<br/><br/>I am not sure how much of all this I actually think is true, but it just jumped into my head and I wanted to share and see what y'all thought.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454760/#Comment_454760" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-07T21:21:27+00:00" title="July  7, 2016  9:21PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 8, 2016 7:14AM by Rickard.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep, I totally agree.

Great point.  <br/><br/>When asking why one or many groups might or might not take to certain games, I think this is a very important part of the equation.<br/><br/>People who learn RPGs through D&amp;D might not necessarily want other RPGs that superficially resemble D&amp;D nearly as much as they want other RPGs for which their D&amp;D-compatible "untold rules" also fit.\n<blockquote>In the context of this thread, what does freeform mean?</blockquote>I have two answers:<br/>1) I'm not sure.  Some vague constellation of play techniques and attitudes and processes which are not reducible to game rules and instructions.<br/>2) Player-to-player communication of fiction without mediation, and the use of that action to effectively pursue a given group's goals.  "Just talking, but not <i>just</i> talking."<br/><br/>I'm more intending (2), but even (2) isn't rigorously defined, and I may have sloppily drifted into (1) at any given point.<br/><br/>Your vehement disagreement might be real!  I may have said something worth vehemently disagreeing with, I fully admit!  I'm happy to hear what you think in either case.\n<blockquote>At the moment I'm thinking that if I take the example of something like Apocalypse World, I should be able to play the game using just the Principles and Agenda, before we get into Moves and more specific mechanics.</blockquote>I think that's a useful analogy.  I don't think it literally holds -- there's stuff about talking fiction that's outside those principles and agendas, and there's stuff in the principles and agendas that's beyond "this group freeforming their way through the world of AW" -- but yeah, that's the general direction I'm thinking.<br/><br/>Once our game is really rolling, we probably don't want to ditch the moves, but we probably could.\n<blockquote>What does this sentence mean? I'm not entirely sure. Can you explain it a little more?</blockquote>I can't figure out how to re-word it any better yet, but I can elaborate.  I don't think that the various practices out there of treating RPG rules differently than board game rules -- e.g. hacking them, forgetting them, deciding not to use them -- are necessarily problems of bad rules or sloppy groups or bad game-group matches.  Those things exist, sure, but beyond them I think there are reasons why a well-functioning group of players who genuinely like an RPG as designed will embed its procedures into an overall play methodology which makes some degree of hacking, forgetting, forgoing, etc. fairly natural.\n<blockquote>does this logic go out the window as an RPG moves along the continuum from freeform play to "boardgame" or strictly procedural play?</blockquote>I would say that hacking/ignoring/etc. boardgame rules does <i>not</i> strike me as natural, so, sure, the more an RPG is a boardgame, the less my musings in this thread fit.  I have never played an RPG where conversational fiction communication wasn't a big thing, but I have heard that that's out there.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454823/#Comment_454823" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-08T18:42:29+00:00" title="July  8, 2016  6:42PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am not sure what you mean when you talk about playing a specific game system "freeform."

Help me bake!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a>, in Character + Setting + Situation + Color + System terms, I'd say that in freeform, System is robust without using the rules and instructions in the book.

"Not explicit rule-following, but also not formless chaos," perhaps.  "Structured freeform" as per Rickard's points, if you think that freeform play requires structure to actually get anywhere.

Of course we still have  Character + Setting + Situation + Colour.<br/><br/>I don't know if it's possible to define "freeform" strictly, but I believe that in this situation Dave means something like this:<br/><br/>* Play an RPG without ever rolling dice, consulting rulebooks, or applying applying mechanical resolution.<br/><br/>At least, that's how most gamers use the term "freeform", in my experience.<br/><br/>Now, that's still a pretty sketchy definition (e.g. some people will write up a detailed character sheet and make sure their character is "points-balanced"... and THEN start playing "freeform"), but hopefully it helps.<br/><br/>That's why I started poking at AW's Principles and Agenda. Most games don't clarify this kind of stuff; AW actually has it in the book.<br/><br/>The question is, precisely, about how System is handled at the table (in Forge terms): how do the participants agree to the imagined events at the table? How do they communicate their game "moves" to each other?<br/><br/>For instance, if I was playing old-school D&amp;D, I might be able to identify some principles like:<br/><br/>* The GM acts, as much as possible, as an impartial "referee", using whatever methods necessary to remain as impartial as possible during resolution<br/>* The players work within that framework to achieve the greatest success they can for their characters<br/>* Long-term success is rewarded in a consistent and reliable way<br/>She should:<br/>* Clarify the possibility of mortal danger when asked<br/>* Play to find out what happens, not towards a pre-determined outcome<br/>* Clarify the probability of success when appropriate<br/>* Clarify when she is NOT able to share the probability of success<br/>* Ask players to detail their actions until she is able to resolve these actions without guesswork<br/>* Give as much information she honestly can in order for the players to gauge risk versus reward<br/>* Be prepared to explain her resolution method for upcoming challenges, if appropriate<br/>etc.<br/>Players should:<br/>* Do their best to succeed at overcoming challenges, but without seeking unfair advantages (like out-of-game knowledge - say, looking at the module before playing)<br/>* Gracefully accept defeat if it happens<br/>* Ask the GM to clarify any points which were not clearly expressed<br/>etc.<br/>* As a group, try to remember rulings and keep them consistent over time (this helps fulfill earlier principles, like impartial GMing and gauging risk vs. reward)<br/><br/>Following a framework like this, I should be able to play something that resembles old-school D&amp;D without any of the actual rulebooks at the table. Over time, if left to my own devices, I might even "evolve" a ruleset which could like entirely unlike D&amp;D cosmetically (e.g. I might not choose to use random stats, or I might use cards instead of dice) but would be recognizable as serving a very similar creative agenda, so a long-time D&amp;D player would feel comfortable jumping in to play.<br/><br/>For instance, using some random elements to resolve particular situations could "evolve" quite naturally out of the need for impartial resolution.<br/><br/>Dave, is this at all along the same lines you're thinking?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454829/#Comment_454829" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-08T19:10:25+00:00" title="July  8, 2016  7:10PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just realized something: Whenever you read rules in the book and assimilate them, your brain puts them on the right place as a part of a specific procedure. <br/><br/>Then on the game you have defined techniques that trigger other techniques or trigger these procedures.

Let's call them "consensus" and "permissive" freeform, for ease of discussion.<br/><br/>1. <b>Consensus freeform</b>: All players must agree on all changes to the fiction.<br/><br/>2. <b>Permissive freeform</b>: When a player says something, it may not contradict what came before, but no one can say it isn't happening.<br/><br/>Let's say we're going to play D&amp;D 5e, but do what you're talking about, and play it "freeform" first. What does this mean? Even if we pick one of these as our "freeform" model, how do we all agree what we're doing? Do we have characters that are humans or dwarves or elves and stuff? Is it a pseudo-medieval setting with monsters? Do we go into dungeons, fight monsters, and take their stuff? Are we a group working together, or are we working at cross purposes? Heck, is each character a single person?<br/><br/>How do we make <i>any</i> of those decisions without some basis of the D&amp;D text? What do we include for context, and what do we exclude? How do you make that determination?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454832/#Comment_454832" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-08T19:16:22+00:00" title="July  8, 2016  7:16PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe more simply put, what differentiates "D&amp;D 5e played Freeform" from "Call of Cthulhu played Freefrom," as you say, "without using the rules and instructions in the book"?<br/><br/>Does "rules and instructions in the book" mean part of the book or all of the book?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454835/#Comment_454835" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-08T19:17:50+00:00" title="July  8, 2016  7:17PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 8, 2016 7:19PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll try to offer an example, and then I'm going to butt out of the freeform-defining business.  I don't think I'm ready to do a great job of that right this second.<br/><br/>Player: I look in my backpack for something useful.<br/>GM: You find some rope, a small knife, some flint, a box, a key... anything specific you're looking for?<br/>Player: How much rope?<br/>GM: Uh... Looks like maybe about 25 feet?<br/>Player: I'm looking for something I can distract the guardian with.  Maybe... maybe something dangerous-looking, or shiny and valuable, or something.<br/>GM: Ah!  Okay, yes, stuffed down in the most secure part of your pack is a big ol' smooth, shiny emerald.<br/>Player: Oh man.  Do I want to risk losing that?  I try to see if I could tie it up in the rope so it wouldn't come loose if I swung it around.<br/>GM: You could take a little time and give yourself a good chance, but it wouldn't be 100% guaranteed!<br/>Player: Okay, I'll do it!  I tie the emerald up, get w good whirl going like (pantomimes arm whirling) with the emerald in my hand still, so the rope's like (pantomimes arc) and then I release!  So the emerald goes whizzing through the guardian's field of view!<br/>GM: Okay!  The guardian kinda flinches a tiny bit but keeps staring forward on the first whirl.  Keep going?<br/>Player: Yes!  faster!<br/>GM: Okay!  After a few more, the guardian's eyes start to focus on the motion, and then they light up when the emerald catches the light!  The creature starts to shift out of it's position in the doorway, heading out into the room toward the swinging emerald!<br/>Player: Everyone, run behind it into the doorway!  I'll come last!<br/>GM: If you leave now, it might break the distraction!<br/>Player: I keep swinging until they're all through!  If it turns before they're through, then I'll... uh... does it?<br/>GM: No, as long as you keep swinging, it keeps moving toward the rope!  Okay, everyone is through the door, but not you, and you're not close to the door yet, and it's getting close to the emerald!  it's beginning to reach to grab it!<br/>Player: I don't want to lose the emerald!  I'll yank it away from the creature as far as I can, and then sprint full speed for the door, dragging the rope behind me!<br/>GM: The emerald might jar loose bouncing against the floor as you run!  The guardian might be able to cut you off from the door if it reacts fast enough!<br/>Player: Has it been reacting that fast so far?<br/>GM: Probably not.<br/>Player: Fuck it!  I go for it!<br/>GM:  Okay!  Your toss of the rope and emerald away from the guardian is awkward as you turn to run.  The creature is close to grabbing the emerald but then sees you darting for the door.  It grabs onto the rope to try to pull you away!<br/>Player: No!  Can I pull the rope out?<br/>GM: It seems stronger than you!  How are you going to get it out?<br/>Player: I could chuck something at it to make it flinch!<br/>GM: If you take time to dig something out of your pack, and don't let go of the rope, it's gonna yank you right over to it.<br/>Player: I could... I could drop the rope, chuck something, then try to re-grab the rope...<br/>GM: (Raises a skeptical eyebrow.)<br/>Player: Oh, but it's pulling pretty hard, right?  If I let go, the rope will quickly be out of my reach?<br/>GM: Yeah.  You'd need to then charge and-<br/>Player: Fuck it.  Maybe there'll be more emeralds.  Maybe that one was cursed anyway.  I drop the rope and run for the door.<br/>GM:  You're through!<br/><br/>That's the first thing that comes to mind when I think "freeform".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454836/#Comment_454836" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-08T19:20:39+00:00" title="July  8, 2016  7:20PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I'm thinking is has a lot to do with understanding and putting into action the game's specific Creative Agenda.

(role playing) like kids do ?</blockquote>\nA good point. I would say "play pretend" instead of just playing, if you mean it in the context of children's play.<br/><br/>In my game <b>This is Pulp</b>, I began looking at how a conversation works - the very basic interaction between at least two people. I then built a structure to steer the conversation, by adding topics to the conversation and how people would respond to each other. So I took something we all are familiar with, and then added a structure to it to turn it into a game. At the same time, I also added an end condition.<br/><br/>I think this is interesting. How someone can take talking, or play pretend, and turn that into a game. I mean, talking and "pretending" is engaging in it's own but by turning it into a game, the game designer can give a specific sensation to the participants. And we have already structures for everything we do.<br/><br/>Roger Caillois "... places forms of play on a continuum from <i>ludus</i>, structured activities with explicit rules (games), to <i>paidia</i>, unstructured and spontaneous activities (playfulness),". (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man,_Play_and_Games" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>) - basically a line where ludus is at one end and paidia at the other. Raph Koster refutes this in <i>Theory of Fun</i> by saying that ludus and paidia is the same thing, it's just spoken and unspoken rules. A child playing in an improvised style is paidia, according to Caillois, but I agree with Koster that it's never purely improvised, but instead falling back on previous (unspoken) structures. (Also, as a side note, Keith Johnstone talks in <i>Impro</i> about how we all have a learned feeling of how to build a story - we know its structure.)<br/><br/>So yeah, (structured) freeform bears a lot similarity to play pretend, at least if we're talking about the use of the normally unspoken structures. What the freeform movement did, at least in Sweden, was dragging paidaia techniques to ludus by speaking out the unspoken rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454917/#Comment_454917" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-09T07:15:55+00:00" title="July  9, 2016  7:15AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>"Free form " isn't that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)" rel="nofollow">flow? </a></blockquote>\nFlow is <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Challenge_vs_skill.svg/300px-Challenge_vs_skill.svg.png" rel="nofollow">one emotional result of playing</a>, where structured freeform is one set of tools to play with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454920/#Comment_454920" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-09T10:52:30+00:00" title="July  9, 2016 10:52AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2016 10:53AM by Paul88.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rickard Said:<br/>"I would say "play pretend" instead of just playing"<br/>Yes that's what I'm trying to say. <br/><br/>"Play Pretend" is a root of free form.

My nephews (4 and 5 year olds respectively) do play often, but there's a toxic element in the way they play, that reminds me of when my cousin and me did play pretend at about their same age. It's when a competitive element arises and there are no limits to damage each other's creativity, and skills in manipulation is all it takes to win.<br/><br/>In the case of my cousin, it mean that when we played war with huge amounts of toy soldiers, he would go for killing single units and small groups often, and then allowed me to kill or capture a big gropu, doing this in a way that prevented me from noticing that he was guiding the whole game and that the math didn't add. He was older, wiser, more subtle and by default I have never been able to distrust anybody who hasn't show any threating attitude at me from the start. Even today I start by giving anyone the benefit of doubt and a minimal of trust, and it takes several issues/fights for me to completely distrust a person.<br/><br/>The case of my nephews is similar, the older one often tricks the younger in the same way, which 70% of the time ends up in a fight between them and the rest of the time in a derrailing into a different game.<br/><br/>So, while for me pure play pretend can work (my cousin and me had a better time when we played with legos or made a team against an imaginary adversary) the moment some kind of opposition controlled by one player arises is the moment we start needing rules to avoid identifying ourserves as a players with one of the sides. <br/><br/>To this particular, randomization not only introduces unexpected situations, but a good way of dissociating the opposition from the player: It isn't the GM harming your character, it's the dice. Rules do the same thing: it's not the GM being unfair, he's just doing what rules demand.<br/><br/>So well, I admit that this is a personal feeling, mixed with perhaps a bit of a personal trauma, but as I have lived it myself and seen it reenacted by my nephews, you can't say it isn't a possible bad outcome, that can be averted with the right tools.<br/><br/>Can those tools be minimalistic, unnoticeable, easily internalized? Yes, I totally believe they can be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454932/#Comment_454932" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-09T17:57:41+00:00" title="July  9, 2016  5:57PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think there's a really big downside to the OP which could be stated like this:<br/><br/>"The best way to play a RPG is to manipulate, seduce, lie to and connive to viciously undermine your fellow players in order to achieve the imaginary outcome you want.

Nomic is no different to structured freeform in that case.<br/><br/>But I kind of get what you're aiming at. Nomic could be said to build a consensus between players; it's in a way a way of building a social contract; creating rules for how to act within the game. In Nomic, the rules are typically mechanical(?) but lets say it's would be about creating purely social ones. A game master could have a specific style to play, and the players adopt to that (read: the game master is creating rules for others to follow), or the game master can see what kind of players that person got and adapts to that.<br/><br/>One thing that stroke me when reading the Wikipedia article was the following: "The game is in some ways modeled on modern government systems. It demonstrates that in any system where rule changes are possible, a situation may arise in which the resulting laws are contradictory or insufficient to determine what is in fact legal."<br/><br/>I instantly thought of game styles colliding within a roleplaying group. You can compromise, and have different playstyles, but it will probably crash sooner or later at some point.<br/><br/>I guess <a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a> brought up Nomic as an example of how to build this social consensus of how to play within the group. It's a slightly different topic than what <a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> is talking about. Building a group consensus is, however, something I'm missing in 99% of all roleplaying games, and I think that having structures for that would actually make people understand the game (read: how to play it) better. It's not something people would think they need, but I think they actually do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454984/#Comment_454984" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-10T11:48:16+00:00" title="July 10, 2016 11:48AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Social rules.

Well, the group won't be even living together, thay just got together for an activity, a game.<br/><br/>As such, we mainly need to know what we're doing and some outlines about how. The Why is of course, for fun. It's a game after all, though it's been proven that it's better if we all are on the same page about what kind of fun.<br/><br/>Basically we will colaborate to create a shared fiction. Then we have to agree how we will interact and modify such fiction, how agency will be distributed.<br/><br/>Let's say we agree that one player will arbitrate what applies and what not, so all the rest can play pretend being a single character, perceiving the fiction through that point of view and limiting their agency to whatever the character can do.<br/><br/>We can brainstorm the background and as much general facts of the fiction as we want. We can handwave lots of these agreeing on genre conventions and a single or more cultural references (books, movies, etc) and get an idea of the general mood of the story.<br/><br/>Then we can define some particulars of the characters and again, agreed in some limits. Like if we're playing in the Lords of the Rings setting, nobody can be any of the book protagonists. Or, we're in a different age in the same setting, etc.<br/><br/>So far it's just some limits we can take our time to discuss, so it's ok.<br/><br/>GM starts narrating, ask for players actions/reactions.<br/><br/>But as we get to a conflict and we have to agreed stuff quickly in real time, we will need a different way to reach consensus.<br/><br/>Let's say all we have is GM fiat. Then it basically comes to what JD said: whoever can convince the GM of something gets agency.<br/><br/>Now, here's where we start with assumptions that kinda worry me:<br/><br/><b>Everybody will naturally argument using only reason and common sense. </b> There's also the speed of your thinking, the timing of your reaction, how imposing is your attitude towards the group (even thinking of a polite and considered player/GM) all these variables and more can easily tip the balance by themselves or by subtly earning the group's approval and then using group pressure. And notice we're considering that all players have a similar level of social skills, which isn't often truth.<br/><br/><b>Everybody naturally shares the same opinion about what counts as common sense and logic. </b> even lifetime friends who went trough the same education, or siblings growing up together cannot share the same beliefs. People reading the same book and hearing the same phrases may interpretate different meanings from it. Players hearing the same GM sitting at the same table may do the same, or even plainly imagine the same description in different ways. Which gets me to:<br/><br/><b>Communication will always/most of the time be clear and perfect</b>. Even if we're all having fun, a later discussion with the same group may reveal different players were having fun with different fictional elements. I've been surprised to find that while I thought my GM skills were lacking the players were actually having tons of fun, and vice-versa, that when I though I was at my best some players had complains that preferred to hide to not spoil the group's fun. While at the end things like that may not feel really important towards the overall experience, they may contribute to decreasing the quality of the experience. And then there are genre conventions where it's appropiate that reasoning processes remain hidden and unclear.<br/><br/><b>No one will think any of the GM's blocking/decissions are wrong/unfounded</b> Especially if we take in account the previous pharagraph. Presented with a bad consequence based on hidden information, all we have is blind trust to go from there. Imagination can turn any slight out-of-the game reason into a more convincing excuse. And as easy as that, doubt appears and distrust is sow.<br/><br/>There's of course much more, and while yes, a party of all "chaotic good" well-intended players can overcome this with creativity (no mocking here, I do think it's perfectly possible) the amount of variables that can send this reeling badly is way too high for my taste.<br/><br/>Now, I can bet that more than one person here can point more than a single easy trick (plain tricks, no mechanics nor procedures) to avoid these and more problems. What would they be? Because those things you're thinking of now are the unwritten rules your group and you have internalized so much that you think it's common sense. What did you tacitally/subconciously agreed/noticed before playing that made freeform possible? What does your group think of you as a facilitator and vice-versa, that made it a good experience? What dynamics prevented those issues from appearing? What kind of gameplay it produced?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455029/#Comment_455029" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-11T19:23:13+00:00" title="July 11, 2016  7:23PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WM, that's a much less hyperbolic/more effective way of getting at my point.

However, no set of rules is likely to solve all play issues.  There will always be some additional work for the group, such as agreeing on which fictional moments should engage which rules.<br/><br/>Once a group has solved all relevant issues and is playing smoothly, that means they are communicating effectively, including but not limited to rules use.  In that situation, it might well be possible for them to successfully use that same style of communication to play without the game's rules.</blockquote>\nI still have a feeling that "it might well be possible" is unnecessarily soft, and that "they likely can" is more the case, but that might be based on my personal history, I guess.\n<blockquote>I can bet that more than one person here can point more than a single easy trick (plain tricks, no mechanics nor procedures) to avoid these and more problems.

System mastery and character immersion are other types of fun, just to give two examples. System mastery is about discover what the system can do and make the best use of it. Character immersion is about taking the fiction and translate that into emotions based on the character's meaning, which in terms will create responses in the fiction. Both will add to the fiction, but by different means. (OK, now I'm starting to realize that controlling fiction is probably another type of mean, and that the end result is creating a shared fiction. So you can ignore this point.)<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Why did you start with GM fiat in your example? To me, structured freeform is about structures to steer the interaction. Sure, the game master can be the one who decides what structure to use, or what consequence a player-used structure brings. I wonder however if the game master shouldn't be just like another player - to remove the hierarchy in favor of the structures. If the main rule is to roll 1d6 in Ludo, that's pretty objective, right?<br/><br/>One way of removing assumptions is to be Nomic about it. Something doesn't exist until it's outspoken, and then everyone has to adapt to it.<br/><br/>I like some types of assumptions. The use of tropes creates assumptions. You know how to act when playing <b>Star Wars</b>, how to draw inspiration from action movies when playing <b>Feng Shui</b>, how you should think when playing <b>Paranoia</b>. Done right, assumptions is a great tool, but there has to be good communication about it on beforehand.

You see, that's one of the things we all use and have internalized so much we don't consider a technique nor a rule, nor a procedure, and yet it is! I mean, how often we start a game saying "we're playing in a post-apocalyptic world mad max-style" and then every player starts to imagine the world by themselves and <i>assumes</i> everyone is picturing things the same way? As soon as everyone has a similar reference in their minds, they have all made assumptions about how narrative will go, how unforgivable and deadly could be the setting, what kind of characters and hazards populate it, how physics work in this world, what is considered logical and common sense, what is known by everyone and what kinds of things are complete mysteries, etc.<br/><br/>Of course, the stronger and best known the reference, the more safe assumptions everyone can make. Compare it to saying "we will play a storygame much alike <i>The Garden of Forking Paths</i> from Borges". I've readed the story and even I am puzzled about what kind of game could it be. "Stronger reference" stands here for one which contains enough memorable characters, scenes, story and detail to allow players make all the assumptions they may need.<br/><br/>So, we've got one lead on the proper way to use Assumptions, Yay!

System mastery and character immersion are other types of fun, just to give two examples. System mastery is about discover what the system can do and make the best use of it.<br/></blockquote>\nGetting on board with  the creative agenda of the activity is really key, here. JD's earlier comments about using manipulation and bribery to achieve the results you want in a freeform game are a fairly logical outcome of people playing "freeform" with the agenda of "system mastery", for instance. But if we're coming at the game from a perspective of, say, "creating fiction together", or some forms of character immersion, we have no need or desire for that.\n<blockquote><br/>The pitch of the game is really important because that will make the participants look at the structures of the game in a certain way.<br/></blockquote>\nThe assumptions we carry into the game are absolutely key, and not just limited to the System/rules at work. A friend of mine used to point out how you can sign up for a Call of Cthulhu game at any convention and you'll usually end up playing with people who are dramatic and good actors - this has nothing to do with the game system or its rules, but with the expectations that come with the genre, playstyle, and reputation of the game.<br/><br/>Setting correct assumptions with the game's pitch is really, really key. It helps communicate what kind of fictional input is appropriate, and what mindset/approach to play the players should be taking. It helps communicate the principles of play for your game, implicitly.<br/><br/>In the later days of the Forge, Ron used to talk a lot about how a proper fictional pitch can be sometimes be the <i>most</i> effective way to get the players on the same page about the goals and processes of play (as in WarriorMonk's examples, above).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455058/#Comment_455058" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-12T21:44:19+00:00" title="July 12, 2016  9:44PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 12, 2016 9:56PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Following up on Paul's last point, Ron once offered me the advice to pitch with "color and reward".  What he meant by "reward" turned out to be more like "feedback" or "consequence" in common parlance, but the point was that it's good to express the core pattern/direction of play.  He summed up Trail of Cthulhu roughly like this: "the more you explore and confront Lovecraftian horror, the more you go mad, as your Mythos Lore score grinds down your Sanity score."  I'm not sure that ToC is really as simple or focused as all that, but it did strike me as a great pitch to get a group on board to play on the same page.<br/><br/>I imagine various reasons to play, freeform or otherwise, could benefit from this.  Genre emulation and exploration of horror are two obvious ones from this example.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough, when I ran a freeform game to introduce someone to roleplaying, there was <i>no pitch at all</i>.

I do think the latter is a challenge.  I just think it's one that can, and to some extent must, be met.<br/><br/>Thinking back on the freeform game I've mentioned (me as GM plus 3 other players), I think most of the "work" I did was not about interacting with any given player, it was about coordinating their interactions with each other.  I believe a phrase I used a whole lot was:<br/><br/>"Okay, wait!  That sounds like a cool thing to do, but while you were doing the previous thing, let's see what everyone else got up to."<br/><br/>This might be the downside of having a GM, that those sorts of responsibilities can be assumed to all fall to one person, so the other players might fail to chip in.  <br/><br/>Thinking about it now, it would have been smart for me to ask for help on some of that stuff, to avoid letting my GM responsibilities get conflated with responsibility for the entire activity.

You can see this with children and their imaginative play and it tends to develop organically. Those structures tend to be imitative of whatever base "inspirational source material they're "celebrating". It an come in various forms. And you'll know right away when there's some sort of clash in the way participants are approaching this and if some have differing ideas of the important structures. Those are those moments of bad childhood play pretend I was talking about. And yet, it's still moving towards "game" because those structures are there, even if they aren't well understood as existing by the participants, nor spoken of, and certainly very rarely written down.<br/><br/>And people will recognize them as games. HG Wells certainly did, hence <i>Floor Games</i> as the title for his book about certain kinds of imaginative play with his kids.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Games become less Game-y</span><br/>IMO, games have goals and winners ( and sometimes losers, if only by default as failure to achieve goals). The more clear the goals and win conditions, the more something is a game.<br/><br/>The less clear the goals and win conditions, the more they are de-emphasized or diffused, the more often that personal satisfaction is a goal more important than stated goals, the more players that can be winners in different aspects, the more that goals are self-defined, and the more that the goals/wins are on a social interaction level,<i> the less something becomes a game.</i><br/><br/>RPGs fit somewhere between these two situations.<br/><br/>That's what I meant about RPGs constantly being in a weird state of Game/Not-Game at the same time.<br/><br/>And there's more, I dunno...social cachet? to Game vs. Play Pretend. <br/><br/>With clear goals, you demonstrate mastery with achieving them. You win. You can't really do that with Play Pretend, but winning in a diffused Goals/ Win Condition is weird.<br/><br/>Also, in fairness, it's generally easier to monetize something that is more clearly a game. Monetizing something in a constant state of flux between Game/Not-Game is hard.<br/><br/>Something successfully monetized also has social cachet at a different level. ( It's a win condition of another sort of social game that we're constantly encountering IRL, whether we wish to be a part of it or not).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455079/#Comment_455079" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-13T14:15:44+00:00" title="July 13, 2016  2:15PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What is my personal interest in various things in the freeform-sphere?<br/><br/>Well, I really just want an even GURPsier GURPs that's vastly simpler to deploy.<br/><br/>I want a body of methods I can learn, then apply to all kinds of weird one-off scenarios, and something that requires very little of any participants as a preliminary to play.

Me, too! And mostly because I have some very scattered interests.<br/><br/>For example, I tend to think of lots of very different scenarios. My brain is all like, <i>"Hey Dood! Wouldn't it be cool if Characters A-D were in situation X in setting/color/genre combo Z! That would be awesome!!!! I wonder what would happen!?! That would be soooo much fun to play!"<br/></i><br/>(Usually large amounts of caffeine are involved at these times.)<br/><br/>Now, sometimes I talk with a good buddy about these ideas. He'll get revved up about them. But his first instinct is to then want to write up a whole game system and universe for them ( usually based on some looser version of a mid-90s White Wolf approach).<br/><br/>Me, I'm thinking,  <i>Why not just write up or share the basic concept verbally/by email, maybe have some notes at most and then go as loosey-goosey as we can possibly get? If not total freeform, then something like Mythic GM Emulator pruned down to the really core basics? Maybe even replace the core resolution chart from MGME with a really pruned back version of the PBTA core mechanic? That and some basic "Good GM" techniques should be all we need. After all, this is basically just a fun, one-night/ one-session one-shot, right?</i><br/><br/>Now, sometimes discussions of Freeform in a broad sense strike me as ...odd.<br/><br/>Usually I'll see someone coming in, and positing, as a negative example, a sort of "freeform" definition that assumes a total and utter blank slate, as if there's no cultural grounding for the participants involved. It's a "freeform" that starts with neither a suggestion of genre/source material, or no knowledge of it on the part of the participants, and little to no basic, workable, everyday, real-world social skills on their part.<br/><br/>Which is kinda frickin silly. Even childhood Play Pretend has those things. Of course you'd have problems if that's really what one meant by Freeform! How could it not?<br/><br/>OTOH, if I took a table, put 4-5 participants at it ( some may have a little RPG experience, but not a lot), put down a couple feet of taped down butcher paper on the surface, a few markers, 4-5 cardboard boxes of various sizes that would fit on the table, handed them a bunch of toys that consisted of the following:<br/>A space man <br/>3 various farm workers<br/>A robot<br/>A bunch of farm animals<br/>3 weird looking aliens and/or monsters<br/>A single 6 sided die ( optional)<br/><br/>... and gave the following background " Our story takes place on Mars a hundred years in the future. Go!", I'm pretty sure they could hack something together rapidly that would be some kind of freeform and a game based on that, with not a whole lot else to go on.<br/><br/>Now, if you secretly recorded what happened and later analyzed what worked, where it broke down, and watched for the social cues going on, that's when you'd start to suss out the structures/methods/whatever you wanna calls 'ems of a freeform. Those are the important things that you could then write up and share as methods with other folks.

I think this is all interesting.  Just maybe see if you can tie it back to the freeform/not freeform dynamics and interactions and associated ideas in the thread?  I bet there's something interesting to be said there.<br/><br/>The thing rattling around my brain when I started this thread is still there, most recently expressed by this bolded part:\n<blockquote>Adam, agreed -- just because a freeform player-GM back-and-forth is easy doesn't mean an entire 4-player freeform game is easy.  I do think the latter is a challenge.  I just think it's one that can, <b>and to some extent must</b>, be met.</blockquote>Meeting that challenge -- those are the unwritten rules, as <a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a> called them.<br/><br/>I have in my head this sort of diagram, where formal rules-governed play sits inside of larger play which is governed by some combo of implicit and explicit practices (whether we call them unwritten rules or freeform skills or the deranged love child of System and Social Contract).  And, in RPGs, the formal game needs the play practices to be good.  And this (those practices, and how good or bad they are) is where the struggle or synergy between books and group habits occurs.<br/><br/>I think much discussion about Apocalypse World's MC stuff -- Agenda and Principles, but also Always Say and Moves -- centers around this.  Many people find them amazing or annoying, confusing or obvious, play-altering or irrelevant, based on how their personal habits and group practices intersect with this text.  Who's convinced, and ready to undertake the hard work of changing the group's unwritten rules?  Who's convinced in theory, but not actually up to that undertaking?  Who's like, "Yeah, whatever, reorganized advice text," and just plays AW's formal rules within the group's usual unwritten rules?<br/><br/>I wonder if there's some utility is calling out the layers and the ways they interact.  I wonder if there are useful takeaways yet to be uncovered in that interaction.  I wonder if published materials can go farther in providing good freeform skills or unwritten rules, and if so, how?<br/><br/>So, yeah, this thread isn't super focused.  So many facets!  I think we're doing a decent job of keeping the parts related, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455093/#Comment_455093" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-14T21:02:01+00:00" title="July 14, 2016  9:02PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2016 9:05PM by Paul88.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I wonder if there's some utility is calling out the layers and the ways they interact<br/><br/>.</blockquote>\n<br/>I think this is the black box we need to find when a game crashes.<br/><br/>One approach could be like Komradebob said \n<blockquote>Now, if you secretly recorded what happened and later analyzed what worked, where it broke down, and watched for the social cues going on, that's when you'd start to suss out the structures/methods/whatever you wanna calls 'ems of a freeform.</blockquote>\n<br/>I'm sure this would give results to help in a future tense but I'm thinking you need something as well in a present tense.<br/><br/>An in game utility.  <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455095/#Comment_455095" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-14T21:08:34+00:00" title="July 14, 2016  9:08PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm right there with you, Dave.

What he meant by "reward" turned out to be more like "feedback" or "consequence" in common parlance, but the point was that it's good to express the core pattern/direction of play...<br/></blockquote>\nFeedback is a quite important area in many ways. The timing of your feedback works as a pacing mechanism, so at some points you'd like to slow it down purposely, introduce pauses or make it quick, even realtime-like, have the players interrupt you and vice-versa for particular effects. The intensity of your feedback can be toned to convey different things. The way it's phrased will signal the player how much agency or input she can give back next. It needs to be well distributed among players to make them all feel part of the experience<br/><br/>Consequence is also a big part of what makes the game interesting. It's where it's defined how and how much the player affected the world in the short and long term, and how further challenges and situation would spin out from what they did or finally resolve.<br/><br/>For freeform you probably need to mentally keep track of how much feedback and good/bad consequences you're giving to each player. It's funny that in structured RPGs you only see pacing mechanisms in combat, or to decide when you would introduce a twist or end the story. It's like we've used freeform pacing procedures since forever, but freefor combat seems to require something else that it still eluding me.\n<blockquote><br/>Interestingly enough, when I ran a freeform game to introduce someone to roleplaying, there was <i>no pitch at all</i>.  It was just, "Here's your environment; what do you do?"  Enjoying the nature of the experience was reason enough to play.  After a few minutes of the process I showed in my <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/454835/#Comment_454835" rel="nofollow">example</a>, we were all in sync, with no need to talk through how it would/should work.  </blockquote>\nThere's no way you could have precise expectatives about a whole media you don't know. Like, for the the people who first ever saw "moving pictures" for the first time, in their adult life, the experience of watching them was more than enough. I doubt they got out of the theather criticizing the lack of a story.\n<blockquote>That experience indicated to me that it's <i>really</i> easy to have a fun back and forth with a GM who's just there to help you have fun.  Thus my take that all the conniving and bullying that's been mentioned in this thread is pure lunacy.  Put your "bad GM" scarring behind, find a nice GM, and GMed freeform is not actually particularly fragile, I'd wager.<br/><br/>The noob in my game probably would have floundered and felt self conscious if I'd brought some other agenda into play, but all I did was answer his questions enthusiastically and respond to his actions enthusiastically and boom, all good.</blockquote>\nThat was my whole point with feedback and consequences above. I can't figure exactly how fair adjudication goes there, except that there's maybe less than I'm used to and total impartiality isn't the foccus here. I mean, if the GM is actively using principles like "look at everything through crosshairs" and "be a fan of the players", giving them every chance to rephrase their actions before executing them, I do feel it's possible to have an enjoyable experience, though not one I'd particularily feel satisfied with. Mostly because of some things and techniques I can't totally feel comfortable with nowadays. <br/><br/>It's not just "bad GM experiences", it's "bad player experiences". Not only you need good GMing skills to freeform properly but players with good techniques to help the GM have fun with it. And if the only option to have freeform is "do not play with those people" there's no chance freeform will ever get my interest. There's a GM social skillset and mindframe for freeform as well as a player's. That it's so internalized you can't point your finger on what makes it functional doesn't mean it isn't there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455100/#Comment_455100" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-14T23:00:06+00:00" title="July 14, 2016 11:00PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Say yes or roll the dice" is a compelling maxim, and I think it can be interpreted to highlight the primary weakness of "pure" freeform play \u2013 sometimes there are situations where "say yes" feels plain wrong. Unless communication and mutual understanding of the creative agenda (loosely speaking) are perfect, and characters never push the limits of their abilities, some sort of  resolution mechanic is necessary.<br/><br/>This could be some sort of implicit or explicit razor like "the most plausible thing happens" or "the most interesting thing happens", or it could be open to negotiation / clarification / collaboration between the players at the table. Or you could have something more concrete and numerical, like bidding, or random number/outcome generation, or what Ron Edwards would call "karma" \u2013 fixed values that either surpass obstacles or don't. (I'm not sure why this would be called "karma", but that's beside the point.) Or, of course, any combination of the above!<br/><br/>I <i>absolutely</i> agree that a good ruleset can aid the "communication and mutual understanding of the creative agenda" that I mentioned earlier, and that the ruleset can fade more or less into the background as players become familiar and comfortable with it and its implications.<br/><br/>Also, for my taste, throwing in some random, impartial element (dice and such) can make play much more interesting. D&amp;D isn't so rewarding in this regard since most of the outcomes are just pass/fail, but PbtA moves (for example) can throw unexpected twists into the fiction, or at least serve as inspiration to do so. Most of the time you may not feel the need to roll, but when you <i>do</i> roll, you get a (more or less) abstract result that you have the opportunity to make concrete by interpreting it in the context of the fiction.\n<blockquote>I think I've seen "there is one GM whose job is X" contribute much more to good play practices than any resolution mechanic.</blockquote>\nI'm on the fence about this.

"Let's see what everyone else got up to!  And hey, catch yourselves and each other on this too!

I usually stop them in their tracks and go to the next player, otherwise we might be missing things that could change the entire scope of the scene or let one player hoard the spotlight.<br/><br/>I use the standard indication "one action per player per turn", a turn being just the moment when I talk directly with one player. We do make exceptions here and there, but I think subconsciously I'm tracking the time I'm taking on each individual conversation and where's the attention of the people at the table, up to the point where I can almost tell when they are about to get distracted and/or we need to change focus. I've got to admit this is a personal skill that is actually really hard to explain. If freeforming requires skills like these then I'll just suck at it, as learning some of these are comparable at learning to dance. Easy for sure... but only after you practice enough. Dancing with someone who knows how certainly helps a lot, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455110/#Comment_455110" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-15T14:18:28+00:00" title="July 15, 2016  2:18PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Once you're able to play a game freeform, then rules can be:<br/>- reminders<br/>- shortcuts<br/>- inspiration<br/>- chance arbitration<br/>- channels for expression<br/>- more stuff that isn't at the tip of my brain<br/>- a sort of second game on top of the freeform game<br/>- optional<br/><br/>This is sort of the way RPG rules have been traditionally used.  </blockquote>\nJust as a tangent, I've come to think of and label this approach as the <i>Themed Ethnic Party Recipe Book Approach to Gaming.<br/></i><br/><br/>Yes, I know how weird that sounds.<br/><br/>It always reminds me of cookbooks my mom would have on her shelf from the 1960s/70s, with titles along the lines of <i>Throw a Mexican Fiesta!</i> or <i>Celebrating Oktoberfest!</i><br/><br/>Sometimes I still see that sort of thing as magazine articles in the checkout line at the grocery store.<br/><br/>Really, they're kind of awesome in their own way, but they are predicated on the idea that you already socially know how to organize a get together.

The [player needs to have the] ability to "share" the toys of roleplaying. <br/><br/>Knowing when to step into the spotlight, when to step back, and how to draw good play out of others. Being able to support another player when they need support (such as playing a villain when another player wants to be a hero, and being prepared to lose to them) and being able to challenge them when the situation demands it.<br/><br/>I believe that this may be the hardest thing about roleplaying games: our natural instinct is generally either to sit and listen (passively), or step in and take control of the entire process (like a railroading GM). For functional roleplaying/story gaming, a person needs to learn to occupy the middle space: to make contributions to play which always demand response from others - ideas which are incomplete, and require another to "fill in" the gaps. That's where the game is born.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455123/#Comment_455123" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-16T06:23:13+00:00" title="July 16, 2016  6:23AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/jangler">@jangler</a> I think I mostly agree with most of your points.  I think we might just be using terms like "mechanics" a little differently.<br/><br/>I'd rather not get into the pros and cons of freeform for its own sake any more than this thread already has.  I'm happy to talk about it in another thread!  But here I'll just respond to the parts that jump out at me as relevant to the "good freeform as context for good play with or without rules" angle.<br/><br/>I think "say Yes or [resolution procedure]" is great on this front because it's well-suited to extend into the freeform / unwritten / play practices domain.  "Always do one of two concrete things" is fantastic if actionable.  A lot or our unwritten practices involve dialogue and talking, so "say X" is a sort of design element that doesn't merely <i>influence</i> such practices, but seeks to actively shape them.<br/><br/>Puppetland is probably the best example of such design that I know, with rules that the GM speaks only in past tense and the other players speak only in character and the group does this for exactly 60 minutes.  That determines a <i>ton</i> of stuff usually left to unwritten rules.<br/><br/>I agree that even "roll Strength to Climb, with a Difficulty number representing the situation" is a rule that can guide the group's impressions about what sort of play is appropriate, and seep into their unwritten rules.  But it doesn't strike me as the sort of thing that's actually going to overcome a group's accustomed ways of doing things.  It <i>might</i> seep into the unwritten rules, but it very, very easily might <i>not</i>.<br/><br/>In other words, on the functional freeform front, "roll these dice or draw these cards to see how your fictional effort goes," is nowhere <i>near</i> in the same league with "you can only speak in character".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

I think your qualifiers are valid.  I just hope they aren't deal-breakers.<br/><br/>I think my language around "good time" and "fun" has been particularly vague -- maybe something like "smooth and satisfying" would be clearer.  What I'm thinking is that everyone is genuinely happy with what they get, and with how they get there, and that this is sustainable.<br/><br/>And then whatever connects that to freeform is the "necessary" part.  What practices are necessary vary by group and play concept, but there's always going to be <i>something</i> that a group needs to make freeform (or the unwritten part of their rules) smooth and satisfying.  I think we can talk about this "necessary" stuff in the general sense, or in personal senses, without needing for it to apply to all games and groups.  Or, well, I hope we can!\n<blockquote>Are we also in agreement that <i>Freeform</i>, as a term, was always meant to be a bit comparative ( and that <i>Structured Freeform </i>is therefore a bit redundant)?<br/><br/>I ask because, if we do agree on that, it means we can skip discussions of theoretical, completely formless, utterly structureless play ( something I'd argue really doesn't exist at all anyway).</blockquote>My working assumption here has been that, while completely formless, utterly structureless play may exist, it won't be sustainably smooth and satisfying.  So when I say "good freeform" or "functional freeform" or "fun freeform" I am assuming some sort of pattern and structure to the proceedings.<br/><br/>For this discussion, I agree, it'd be nice to not have to type out "structured" every time.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>
