Let me share my opinion on the game with the forum.<br/><br/>Ville Vuorela is one of the serious rpg designers in Finland, an old-timer who was doing indie rpgs in the '90s already. Without excess rhetoric, let me just say that he's one of the few traditional designers (that is, designers of rpgs in the mainstream tradition) who works indie, and who's under clear and constant pressure from assholes like myself to up his game - we've been sparring for years in the Finnish fishbowl between all the passionate roleplayers, and I know how hard Ville's taken all the critique at times. <i>Stalker</i> is a spectacular work in this context, I think: the tradition ordinarily suffers from vague and two-faced writing conventions, but Ville has managed to leave all that behind and tell his game how it is. There are no lies about combat systems that won't be used, dice rolls that will be fudged or complex character-building subgames to keep players busy while the GM spins his plot. The only game text I can compare here is <i>Dread</i>, it's a similarly honest text that retains the '80s-'90s tradition of gamemastering while shedding the conventional lies and telling the game how it really is.<br/><br/>As for how it is, in a nutshell: <i>Stalker</i> is an immersive simulationistic game about the society fringes that have developed around the Zones left behind by mysterious alien visitors. The player characters are "stalkers", people who explore these territories of warped natural law, usually illegally, armed with little but their ingenuity and desire to get out of their marginalized position in life. There are no kewl powers or neat factions for your character to belong to, it all strives to be very down-to-earth and life-like. The Zone is science horror and utter mystery, and the game has shed all pretense of D&amp;D-like hack'n'slash entertainment. The way I read it, the game asserts a strong creative agenda for discovering the wonders of the zone and the ultimate fates of the player characters: does a player develop his character into a "long-timer", who cannot let go of the peculiar scene around the zones, or can the character score big, sell off some illegal alien artefacts and get out.<br/><br/>The game's system is very much GM-controlled and the players have no formal narrative authority (I say this because it's the first thing people ask about new games). However, in practice the players have strong, constant input on the fictional positioning of pretty much everything due to the way the resolution system works: instead of dice the GM is obligated to run a constant numerical evaluation of the ideas and solutions that the player characters engage in during challenges, which necessitates constant revision and communication about the fictional situation. Basically, the player describes how his character is engaging a tricky situation, and the GM scores the solution in a few categories to get a final effectiveness rating. (There's also a modern hero point resource system on top of this for those moments when your character really needs to push.) I've played this, and it sounds a little awkward due to the GM funnel, but what it actually does is, it forces the entire group to pay constant attention to fictional positioning: where everything is, what is available, what is reasonable. The resulting resolution has a ring of truth to it, because the system never mandates a surprising resolution: what happens is always something that the dialogue at the table has established as the reasonable outcome. Where surprising heroic deeds have been accomplished, the players always understand afterwards why things went down the way they did. It's a calm, deep-running system that suits well for the creative goals of the game.<br/><br/>I'd also like to go on record about the literary quality of the setting: so much of roleplaying game writing is neck-deep in American "cool" that an adult, restrained, grim and grey setting feels refreshing in comparison. It's similar to the style and genre positioning Call of Cthulhu has enjoyed for years as a totally straight game that contrasts horror with understated realism of society and character. Unlike CoC, though, I can get Stalker to run with my limited trad GMing skills, due to the more functional character creation and positioning system <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366431/#Comment_366431" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-10T12:51:06+00:00" title="March 10, 2012 12:51PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2012 12:52PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of all the RPGs I've never GMed, this is the one I'm most eager to try.

There is a kernel of truth to it, but don't expect much; it's not a big and fundamental thing. Besides, it's just my own personal hang-ups. I could definitely talk about CoC in more length in a new thread, though; if the following whets and appetite in that regard, let's get to a different thread and talk CoC for real. I do think that the game is difficult, all the more so because of my long history with it.<br/><br/>(It goes without saying that the following is in no way intended as Stalker sales-speech by bashing CoC. That'd be stupid. I'll just describe the parallels that came to me when writing the above, and if you want to talk more about the strengths and weaknesses of CoC we can do that somewhere else.)<br/><br/>Regarding character creation and positioning, CoC has been historically difficult for our gaming culture because it basically does nothing to support character creation: it's all a giant point-buy, without even having different types of crunch to buy like most point-buy systems provide. I am older and wiser now, and understand that you're supposed to come up with a strong character concept yourself and then allot points to skills on that basis, but even then it's not structured at all. What's worse, the system doesn't ensure that the characters develop the necessary motivations and personality and fictional positioning for the game to "go". In my experience one of the most difficult things in playing CoC has been to take a set of disparate individual characters and actually get them to cohere into any sort of monster-hunting team. This is understandable, the game's color and style promises realism and a deep view on the setting; the players respond to that, I've never been in a CoC group that would've done the smart thing and pre-established the "investigator" thing as a given framework and precondition for the rest of character creation; it's always all about creating entirely innocent bystanders who presumably just happen to get swept along by the events all natural-like, without anybody having to specifically decide that their character is going to start acting like an adventurer. Anybody can see how well that'll eat up all the play time, even assuming the GM is good enough to pull it off.<br/><br/>Stalker simply does the character creation step better: it directly requires you to establish your character as a "stalker" (a person who wants to or tries to or has already journeyed to the Zone), and there is enough structure for evolving your character piece by piece instead of just having to distribute 500 points between 40 different skills. The type of detail that gets established about player characters tends to be both sufficient and useful, which hasn't been the case in CoC for me. This is a simple technical thing, it's just about splitting your character creation into various steps and answering different sorts of questions about your character, so that the creative work happens effortlessly and the thing you create actually ends up having utility in the game. Once the character is actually done, the further in-play development is pretty similar between the games. Stalker relinquishes even the little subgame of "use skills to improve them", though, in favour of saying that your character will only improve if fictional positioning thus mandates: to learn a new skill, have your character learn a new skill, which is usually not feasible within the time-frame of a rpg adventure.<br/><br/>Of course, the two games are entirely different regarding their topic and milieu, so I wouldn't want to take the comparison any further. Still, I could imagine playing CoC with the Stalker rules-set, it should work pretty much out of the box. Stalker is an action-focused game (in the sense of characters interacting with their environment), so there would be a lot of minutiae about how <i>exactly</i> do you go about finding this piece of information from the library, or how <i>exactly</i> do you convince this guy about things. It would be slower than CoC can be, but no slower than the way we always used to play CoC, and at least the time would be spent in atmospheric and interesting ways.<br/><br/>Incidentally, if it sounds like Stalker does the exact same things <i>Delta Green</i> or <i>Trail of Cthulhu</i> does in comparison to classical CoC, then you're probably right. The set-up has always been a great weakness of Cthulhu in my opinion, it's a strange combination of D&amp;D-like monster-hunting assumptions and total agnosticism regarding what the game is about - the character creation system and the entire preplay procedure is really nothing of the sort, the game just gives you a system of <i>modeling</i> characters and leaves you to figure out for yourself what sorts of characters you might wish to model. I understand that ours was not the only corner of the world where Cthulhu was encountered <i>first</i> (as in, before D&amp;D), with no presumption of monster-hunting commando teams. The result has apparently been similarly confused for some other people, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366455/#Comment_366455" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-10T17:45:06+00:00" title="March 10, 2012  5:45PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Roadside Picnic is a great, sometimes disturbing, ultimately wonderful book.

The book details the "French zone" in quite a bit of detail as a starting point, and the general assumption is that over several trips to the zone the player characters gain experience in recognizing the dangers and geography of the place. The GM is supposed to prep challenges, difficulties and wonders involved in this with a sort of "bandolier" technique: you develop some shit and then throw it down as pacing and consistency indicates. The type of content you need to prep for the Zone isn't usually very geography-dependent, so this works well. The game text is clear on what it expects of the GM: there aren't a lot of mechanical tools for prep, but the basic tasks and responsibilities are clear, so it's a game that suits for load-carrying GMs.<br/><br/>(To give an idea of the traditional, deep-delving setting stance of the game, here's a <a href="http://maps.google.fi/maps?q=http://www.burgergames.com/stalker/stalker_paikat.kmz" rel="nofollow">Finnish-language Google map</a> that shows the placement of the Zones on Earth and makes some notes about some of them.)<br/><br/>As I mention above, the default Zone for the campaign is the French zone, which is somewhat different from the Zone described in Roadside Picnic. There is an internationally funded overwatch organization that is supposed to regulate and prevent civilian entry to the Zone, but in practice the system is full of holes, not the least because the Zone happened to bisect the city of Toulouse on arrival, immediately creating a disenfranchised, zone-contaminated slum right on the urban edge. Stalkers are depicted as an insular, international subculture, the members of which travel from Zone to Zone as necessary and dodge or cooperate with local governments as opportunity demands.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366459/#Comment_366459" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-10T18:06:53+00:00" title="March 10, 2012  6:06PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>What's worse, the system doesn't ensure that the characters develop the necessary motivations and personality and fictional positioning for the game to "go".

I'd say that GMing this game relies on being compelled by the relatively ordinary idea of setting your game in the slums of post-apocalyptic Toulouse (the rest of the world is just fine, but Toulouse didn't fare well after the Visitation), from whence a dangerous expedition into the unknown coheres and commences. Then you need to prepare your own personal vision of what is to be found on the Zone. The book certainly includes a lot of examples and suggestions, but ultimately you'll need to perhaps get out a topographical map, or write a series of encounters, or otherwise do your own legwork on what to show to the players. Improvisation is of course a possibility, but that's load-bearing of sorts as well; either way, the GM needs to bring his A-game to a traditional game like this. One might well say that the game here is just a venue for the GM to transmit his own fevered science horror vision to the players. The players control the pacing, but the GM preps the content.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366499/#Comment_366499" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-10T23:14:52+00:00" title="March 10, 2012 11:14PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does it explain what a rattling napkin or a lobster eye is?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366503/#Comment_366503" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-11T00:00:54+00:00" title="March 11, 2012 12:00AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Apparently there'll be POD availability if his pages are technically good.</blockquote>Gotcha.

The book has I think one paragraph's worth of text about the other Zones each, so they're a blank slate for anybody wanting to set a campaign in e.g. the American Zone.<br/><br/>Also, curiousity: why is France an odd choice? Could be our respective geographies, but from here in Finland it doesn't seem that odd (and almost any choice at all would be international). To the contrary, if I had to guess, I'd say that Ville chose it specifically because it's a familiar culture and a civilized country, which helps contrast the Zone with the ordinary European landscape. If he'd focused on say the Japanese Zone, then the game would be "that game set in Japan with Stalker stuff in it" from the viewpoints of many Finnish gamers. You'd spend as much time roleplaying the Japanese society as you'd spend on Zone-related matters.<br/><br/>I should note that I haven't seen the English-language text of the game, I'm just talking on the basis of the Finnish edition.

System-wise I probably personally prefer Stalker right this moment, insofar as "which I would rather play" goes, but this probably has a lot to do with the uniqueness of Stalker's system, how challenging it seems to me to play something out of my usual comfort zone like that.

While I enjoy the hell out of STALKER, and particularly like the FLOW system, I was wondering: How well do you think it would handle something like a high-powered fantasy game, like Exalted or Anima Beyond Fantasy (those level of high-powered characters, not the settings of those games)? I ask because it's occurred to me over the years that those games could do away with a lot of the crunch in their systems, if they had a good diceless system in place. <br/><br/>Obviously the scale would have to be adjusted. But how would you, the designer of the system, adjust it? And how would you keep the system you have in place for statistics (because I like how your system does attributes)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burgeri" title="Burgeri"><img alt="Burgeri" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burgeri">Burgeri</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369915/#Comment_369915" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-29T02:55:03+00:00" title="March 29, 2012  2:55AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, an interesting question. One I've been thinking about a lot, actually, albeit with different games. <br/><br/>If, (and that could be a big if) the players and the gamemaster have a common vision on how the genre reality in a high-powered game works, FLOW should fit the bill. The Idea/Roleplaying ratings are easier to give in Stalker since the game reality and genre is rooted to our reality and we all share an idea of how that works (or should, at least). This might not be so easy to do in a game/genre approaching superheroic power levels. Then again, I might be underestimating your players.<br/><br/>If that is resolved, I don't see any issues in the game mechanics why it should not work. The one thing FLOW does poorly compared to many other systems is power accumulation, so if levelling is a strong theme in the game/genre, some fundamentals would have to be rethought. On the other hand, FLOW would fit something like the Game of Thrones like a glove.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_370819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P" title="Adrian P"><img alt="Adrian P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P">Adrian P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370819/#Comment_370819" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-03T01:16:53+00:00" title="April  3, 2012  1:16AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Any indications on what the POD price is likely to be?

I had four players - made pre-gens, Abilities, Drawbacks, and gear only. I gave the players a little time to flesh out the characters before playing and we jumped into a quick intro scenario I hacked out the previous evening. The PC's had to sneak into the Klamath Falls Zone and retrieve an artefact for a client.<br/><br/>It went very well. I stressed up front that the players should be particularly explicit in how they frame their character's actions, and they were for the most part. I stuck mostly with the standard evaluation method (Idea X Roleplaying) with a little bonus if they had a high stat. It was interesting that the Drawbacks pushed play so heavily - as I understand it there's no really good mechanical reason to use them, but the players loved influencing their narration with stuff like 'Impatient' and 'Creepy Stare'.<br/><br/>The setting is great - everyone remarked how weird and creepy the Zone was, which I think was key to the session's success. I threw in an Iron Bastard (a big metal automaton with a mating call of sorts that sounds like an air-raid siren). Thing scared them <i>shitless</i>. It was also fun to  throw in an open field with 24 nude, dead bodies neatly arranged in four rows. They spent 30-odd minutes trying to puzzle it out (and doing a good job of creeping themselves out with various horrible theories) before moving on. Truth is: it meant nothing. Just a good way to elicit some goosebumps from the players.<br/><br/>Conflicts were sparse but tense. I probably could have done a better job of pushing for goal-oriented narration, rather than 'I do this', which caused a bit of confusion.<br/><br/>Overall it was a neat little game. I want to play more - and one of the players went straight home and ordered the .pdf...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386108/#Comment_386108" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-31T20:41:33+00:00" title="July 31, 2012  8:41PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, <i>Stalker</i>'s Story Game soul resides in those Drawbacks.
