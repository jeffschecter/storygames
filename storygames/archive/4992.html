In particular, I'd made up a neat little scenario that used some figures that I doubt people would tend to have laying around and which really were a bit expensive to collect simply for a one shot scenario.<br/><br/>[Come to think of it, the last few figures are close to being in the on-deck position in my paint queue. Hmmm.]<br/><br/>The idea I'd had was to try to hook up with some like minded trustworthy individuals and start trading stuff like this back and forth. The idea wouldn't be to keep the set, but to play it with your local group, then pass it along. You wouldn't even necessarily be trying to get your original set back, you'd just be trying to pass it along to the next folks as far as it would go.<br/><br/>[If it worked out really well, I hoped each person encountering the boxed scenario would add a bit of something of their own: A bit of terrain, a variant rule or two, maybe a couple of figures, or a translation to another rule-set. Maybe just pics of themselves and their pals playing the game in the name of a little penpal style community building]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112369/#Comment_112369" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-06T10:56:47+00:00" title="December  6, 2007 10:56AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>Does anyone think a "Netflix"model for indie games might work, somehow?

Stuff you play once, maybe twice, and would normally shelve for a while (maybe forever). An actual business that stores and sends out playable copies, allowing each subscriber to keep X individual products per Y dollars a month. (You've heard of NetFlix, ya?)<br/><br/>Alvin, I think such products *would* have to fit a particular mold; and, yes, it could run rather a lot as compared to a NetFlix package... but perhaps not!<br/>1) Make paper cover (NOT soft cover) editions, and make them to maximize the use of the page space (i.e. no airy art books). The more "disposable" the book, the better (for wear and tear) and the lighter the final product, the better (shipping reduction).<br/>2) Ship bulk or book rate, and customers are aware that the time to rotate in their new game could be rather long. Further, a proper business could get a lot better chipping on this stuff, due to the high volume (hopefully), that it could end up rather cheap.<br/>3) Perhaps drop the "keep X as long as you like, return whenever" model in favor of a "you may have X returns/replacements a month." Thus, there is no variability of cost to ship for each subscriber (whereas with NetFlix, a diligent subscriber could be recycling a DVD every few days!).<br/>4) Don't forget that folks can't keep them forever... so a great game that actually has a lot of replayability is going to get BOUGHT by those who love it, much like a deep PC game that's rented for a weekend might be bought later, to finish it out over months (which would be cost-prohibitive if rented for that time).<br/><br/>Again, I'm merely spitballing for opinions and refinements to a potential business model. Such an endeavor would likely be beyond my means and business connections... but that's not to say that someone like IPR couldn't try it out in a test market or for a limited set of products.<br/><br/>Just thinking out loud;<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
