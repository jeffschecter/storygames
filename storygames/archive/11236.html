Do what?  Run a game.<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11171" rel="nofollow">As I've mentioned</a>, one of my preferred genres is the western played straight, preferably Italian-style.  So I've borrowed some tried-and-true Italo-Western tropes and a page from <i>Apocalypse World</i> and put something together that I'm interested in running over a session or three for a few players.  We would meet in the <i><a href="/forums/search?Search=%23playnow&amp;Mode=like">#playnow</a></i> channel and then port over to something specific to the game.<br/><br/>I went back and forth on a ruleset for this thing and finally decided to go with something semi-freeform.  No character sheets and such, but a dice-resolution mechanic (the steal from <i>Apocalypse World</i>) for when challenges come up.  Italo-Western heroes and villains all tend to have the same skills when they aren't sharing the exact same names \u2014 Django, I'm looking at <i>you</i> \u2014 so I feel this'll work.  I'm sure everyone will tell me if it doesn't.<br/><br/>Which leaves time.  Weekends are best.  During the week I'm generally on in the mornings and not so much the afternoons/evenings.  Depending on how we schedule things I may be able to work around that and get some PM gaming happening M-F, but....<br/><br/>And that's it.  The town of Split Rock, somewhere along the Texas/Mexico border, awaits.  The sun is blasting down hard on the shale and even the plants wish they could find shade.  There's a blood price for wanted men.  They say it's a dollar a bullet.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
