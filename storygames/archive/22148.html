                    Okay, this is a thread about the [framework/theory/proposition/model] that I started exploring <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22138/shared-imagined-space-vs-game-state-or-in-game-vs-real-world-cues#latest" rel="nofollow">over in another thread.<br/></a><br/>Before I address any of the points raised in the other thread, I offer this.<br/><br/><b>A PROVISIONAL GLOSSARY</b><br/><i>Please note that some terms in the glossary may change as the model develops.</i><br/><br/><b>ROLEPLAYING</b>  – The totality of all the activities that one engages in while actively participating in the hobby that this website is devoted to discussing.  This includes both GAMING and JAZZING. Please note that “playing a role” is a small part of sum total of the activities involved, and that ROLEPLAYING, PLAYING, and GAME are all terms that have several other definitions outside the context of this model.<br/><br/><b>GAMING</b> – The act of engaging in game play, but only in the context of ROLEPLAYING. (Formerly Vanking) GAMING can be defined as the actions performed while ROLEPLAYING that are informed by PRESCRIBED RULES.<br/><br/><b>ARTING</b>: The act of engaging in the creation of an artistic PRODUCT using GAMING as one of the INGREDIENTS. Only used in the context of ROLEPLAYING. (Formerly Jazzing, Formerly Zonking) ARTING can be defined as actions performed while ROLEPLAYING that are informed by DESCRIBED RULES.<br/><br/><b>INGREDIENTS</b>: The mediums, tools, and techniques used produce a PRODUCT.<br/><br/><b>PRODUCT</b>: The result of an artistic endeavor. In the context of ROLEPLAYING, the result which is produced by using GAMING as an INGREDIENT to engage in the act of JAZZING.

                            Now, onto the discussion.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> <br/>According to Thanuir there isn’t a term for playing an instrument that isn’t PELI. This will not do. <br/><br/>I will amend the statement I said in the other thread: English AND Finnish suck.<br/><br/>But…<br/>I’m prepared to declare ZONKING as the act of LEIKKI within the context of MOOPING.<br/>The reason for this is thus: Playing House, or Cops &amp; Robbers, or any act of pretend is really just a very primitive form of simultaneous art production, performance, and consumption. It differs from improvisational theater only in quality, not in category. Or so I currently think.<br/><br/>I have a question, however. Does LEIKKI have any negative connotations? As in, does the word conjure images of something being childish or immature? Because that won’t do either. I want a word that encompasses all the things mentioned above, and if anything, leans more heavily towards a more mature connotation.<br/>So for right now, I’m leaving ZONKING and LEIKKI as separate types of actions, but this could change. ZONKING would still exist as a term, but only in the context of MOOPING. For right now, I’m leaving ZONKING to mean an action that can’t currently be described as a type of LEIKKI, as I’m not entirely convinced this is accurate.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">@Thanuir</a>
<blockquote>Part 1, on zonking<br/><br/>I am not convinced that zonking is terribly far from play. Here are some classical definitions of play, for reference: <a href="http://scholarpedia.org/article/Definitions_of_Play" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://scholarpedia.org/article/Definitions_of_Play</a><br/><br/>Certainly children playing satisfy the following: "It's specifically playing improvisational jazz piano with a group, both working with and being inspired by the creative choices of the other members of the group, with yourself and the other members of the group being the primary (if only) audience for that performance."<br/><br/>Maybe you want a component of skill or demonstrating skill, which is debatable when children play. Or some other distinguishing factor.</blockquote>
As discussed above, I’m 99% convinced you’re right. Actually, I’m 100% convinced that ZONKING is a type of play, now that I’ve read what you said. However, I’m not quite there on labeling it a specific type of play (LIEKKI) until I’ve learned more about its connotations. <br/>But you’re right, children playing is in the same category as freeform jazz. I’m just not sure which of these I believe:<br/><br/>1.	Playing “House” and playing jazz are both LIEKKI<br/>Or<br/>2.	Playing “House” (LIEKKI) and playing jazz (NOT LIEKKI) are both ___________________.<br/>
<blockquote>Part 2, state of play<br/><br/>Yes, state of play (of piano or chess or roleplaying game) is on level 1. It exists with all of those activities. In a group performance, maybe it would be the current soundscape and the present position of (say) their fingers on the piano keyboard. (My English vocabulary is not sufficient here; try to understand.)<br/>But yes, the playstate is a low level concern. It also exists in imaginative play of children.<br/><br/>By resolution, I simply meant the outcome of any given action. Still a low level concern: Given the way the pianist moves their fingers and their feet, what kind of music is created? This depends on the current soundscape and the precise details of the pianist's physiology and actions, which are also affected by their emotional state and possibly conscious choices.</blockquote>
I agree completely.
<blockquote>Part 3, motivation and art<br/><br/>If you are saying that all roleplaying (by which I mean: engaging in the act of playing roleplaying games; or perhaps joint creation of shared fiction) produces a fictional transcript that can be considered as art, I agree.<br/><br/>If you are claiming that the purpose of all roleplaying is to create that art, I probably disagree.<br/><br/>Maybe you claiming something related to these?</blockquote>
I am definitely claiming the first (not controversial, I hope).<br/><br/>I am definitely NOT claiming the latter. That is an opinion on a particular creative agenda. It’s definitely some people’s agenda, but certainly not for all, or even the majority. But agendas have no place in my current model. <br/><br/>My main claim (as defined for now) is this:<br/><br/>Engaging in our Hobby during actual play is not a single activity, but actually several individual activities. The main (only?) two are VANKING and ZONKING.*<br/><br/>*<i>Whether all activities can be subsumed into either VANKING and ZONKING, or there are activities outside of those two categories has yet to be determined.<br/></i><br/><br/>These two activities, though related because of they are both part of a larger whole, are still individual and do not overlap.<br/><br/>The closest analogy is Biathlon. Skiing and Shooting are separate activities, but they are subsumed under a larger title. The differences being that in our hobby both activities occur simultaneously.<br/><br/>The other difference is that one of the activities – ZONKING, relies in part on the performance of the other – VANKING. This relationship is described by what I call the THREE TIER MODEL that was discussed in the other thread and will be revisited soon.<br/><br/>In short:<br/><br/>TIER 1: Ingredient (Vanking)<br/>TIER 2: Artistic Creation (Zonking)<br/>TIER 3: Product<br/><br/>Why is this useful?<br/><br/>For one, I believe this model, and terminology created to describe it, could end much of the current talking past each other and misunderstandings that occur when viewing our hobby as a single activity, not a conglomeration of many.<br/><br/>The words, PLAY, GAME, and RULES mean entirely different things depending on which activity one is discussing. <br/><br/>In addition, many current theories/arguments label these separate activities as either:<br/><br/><b>1.Different individual goals one has when participating in a single activity.<br/><br/>2.Different types of the same activity. (You’re either Vanking or Zonking)<br/><br/>3.	Sources of incoherency if a game’s design or player is attempting to Vank and Zonk at the same time. (The are both always present and designing more for one has nothing to do with designing less for the other. Desiring good Zonk does not require ignoring/loosing the option for good Vank.)<br/><br/>4.	Identical, meaningless distinctions.</b><br/><br/>I propose there is much to be gained by viewing our hobby through this lense, as it opens up new possibilities in design and serves to limit miscommunication.                        </div>

                            SICP was the book that taught me to program!<br/><br/>I find the made-up vocab incredibly hard to think with. It was fine when there was, like, one made up word when we all used, Blorb. But I just can't wrap my head around this etymology-less, morpheme-less profusion of words that have no relation to any other words. I'm not gonna use this vocab, because I'd have to look it up every damn time I wanted to write about it, and that's enough of a barrier that I'd simply never do it.<br/><br/>You define mooping as role-playing. Great. When talking about this stuff, I'm gonna say <b>role-playing</b> to refer to that concept.<br/><br/>You say peli means structured play, with rules and objectives. You say vanking is peli in the context of RPGs. Great. When talking about this stuff, I'm gonna say <b>structured play</b>.<br/><br/>You say zonking is the creation of an artistic product using structured play. Great. I'll refer to it as <b>structured creation</b>, or maybe structured artistic creation, or structured performance.<br/><br/>I encourage you all to do the same.<br/><br/>As a bonus, it gives outsiders <i>some earthly bloody clue</i> what the heck we're talking about.<br/><br/> </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Jeph">@Jeph</a> <br/><br/>MY NONSENSE WORDS! MY BEAUTIFUL NONSENSE WORDS!!!!!<br/><br/>You're right, that was never gonna fly long-term. But I'm not using "Structured Play" and "Structured Creation" because I want a one word terms, and the word "Play" can apply (with different definitions) to each activity.<br/><br/>So I changed the glossary.<br/><br/><b>ROLEPLAYING</b> is now the name for our hobby. Please do not use "Game" anywhere when referring to this, as only one part is GAMING and it mistakes a part for the whole. Also, I'm not using a dash. It's all one word. Give me this, please.<br/><br/>VANKING is now <b>GAMING</b>. I like this, because this is the only part of the activity that involves playing a game. It makes that clear, at least. It still has the problem that some people out there are prone to using GAMING to mean ROLEPLAYING. If someone has a better one-word term, let me know.<br/><br/>ZONKING is now <b>JAZZING</b>. It's the closest thing I can come up with to what I'm trying to describe, and the fact that the word has nothing to do with the playing of a game makes it clear that we're dealing with two separate activities. Also, nobody generally uses that word in relation to our hobby.<br/><br/>Hopefully, these will do for now.                        </div>

                            Perfect!<br/><br/>When we roleplay, we're gaming in order to jazz, creating an artistic product. Like a ballerina moves in order to dance, creating an artistic product.<br/><br/>I'm not totally sure I agree with your claim that these are different activities. If they're different and don't overlap, should we be able to ascribe any given action a player takes to either one or the other, gaming or jazzing? When a player in Dungeon World says, "I hack &amp; slash!" which one are they doing? It seems like simultaneously both a structured interaction with a rule, and a contribution to the artistic product.<br/><br/>What you've written, and some of Jay's and Yukamichi's earlier posts, have made me start thinking of all these different possible levels as... ugh. It's what modal logic calls "possible worlds," but the word "world" is overloaded when talking about RPGs. I'm looking for something that means "sets of propositions," or "sets of beliefs," or "sets of facts." I'll go with <b>perspectives</b>.<br/><br/>Anyway, all the different models we've introduced can be analyzed as a perspective on somewhat-overlapping entities.
<ul>
<li>Any given player's privately held beliefs about imagined events are one such perspective.</li>
<li>Imagined events that have been communicated, shared, made manifest, placed into the common ground between any given combination of players are another such perspective.</li>
<li>Bits of information codified by the physical state of the actual, real pencil and paper and minis and maps and dice we're using are another perspective.</li>
<li>Mandated-by-the-rules but as-yet-unknown-to-anyone outcomes are another.</li>
<li>Information in a module or prep is yet another.</li>
<li>"Gaming" refers to interacting with the propositions in another of these perspectives.</li>
<li>"Jazzing," interacting with the propositions in yet another.</li>
</ul>
We can say that, <i>under a chosen perspective</i>, some statement about some entity is true or false. Has my character been poisoned yet. Do I have 6 hit points remaining.<br/><br/>Without taking a perspective, such a statement is meaningless.<br/><br/>We can further say that some perspectives are <i>accessible</i> from others. This is another modal logic thing. If B is accessible from A, it means that under the perspective A, B is a live possibility.<br/><br/>In play, when we discover inaccessible perspectives—We'd all been thinking the stronghold was on the west side of the plateau, but the prep says it's on the east—we need to stop and engage in repair processes. Resolve disagreements until we re-establish accessibility.<br/><br/>When accessible perspectives interact, they merge seamlessly.                        </div>

The idea of "game = structured, goal-oriented play" is one of the worst in the whole field of game thinkery.<br/><br/>Show me some kids at play, I'll show you structures and goals, even if they're purely implicit, purely intuitive, fleeting, and even if the kids are too young to identify and articulate them.<br/><br/>We invented game design as a craft in order to explain and articulate the gameplay impulse that we feel as creative, thinking beings. Games = toys = puzzles = tricks = play.<br/><br/>Before the gods and everybody, you shouldn't care what I think, but you should reconsider this idea on its own poor merits.<br/><br/>Third, I don't think your model needs it. (It had better not! If it does, it's a bad model. But I don't think it does.) I think the idea isn't built into your model, it just appears in your terminology.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>

Or the concepts I'm exploring split along different lines than those words imply.<br/><br/>The problem is, every word I try to find to apply in these cases ends up having different meanings which correspond to the two different categories - play, composition, performance, exploration...<br/><br/>Which either means I'm onto something big, or I'm just making up false dichotomies.<br/><br/>I guess we'll see.<br/><br/>More tomorrow. <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/> </div>

                            I would say that the difference between peli and leikki is related to how explicit the goals and structures are.<br/><br/>Of course, if one wants to analyze how the words are actually used, it goes back to Wittgenstein's language games and to things being called based on whatever design tradition they come from, so any digital activity that looks even vaguely like a game is called a game (peli), no matter how playful and exploratory it is.<br/><br/>I, at least, need to change perspective when moving from peli to leikki or the other way around. The mentality is different. English does have the word "playful", for example, which does not describe all play.<br/><br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I agree with Jeph that following a discussion with arbitrary terms was challenging.<br/><br/>---
<blockquote class="Quote"><br/>Why is this useful?<br/><br/>For one, I believe this model, and terminology created to describe it, could end much of the current talking past each other and misunderstandings that occur when viewing our hobby as a single activity, not a conglomeration of many.<br/><br/>The words, PLAY, GAME, and RULES mean entirely different things depending on which activity one is discussing. <br/><br/>In addition, many current theories/arguments label these separate activities as either:<br/><br/><b>1.Different individual goals one has when participating in a single activity.<br/><br/>2.Different types of the same activity. (You’re either Vanking or Zonking)<br/><br/>3.	Sources of incoherency if a game’s design or player is attempting to Vank and Zonk at the same time. (The are both always present and designing more for one has nothing to do with designing less for the other. Desiring good Zonk does not require ignoring/loosing the option for good Vank.)<br/><br/>4.	Identical, meaningless distinctions.</b><br/><br/>I propose there is much to be gained by viewing our hobby through this lense, as it opens up new possibilities in design and serves to limit miscommunication.</blockquote>

In poker, I'm asked to believe that you have been dealt a hand of immutable but unknown cards out of the set of 52. Similarly, the card at the top of the deck is also an immutable but unknown member of that set.<br/>From how some of the peeps on here reacted to hearing about such a game,<br/>the playing cards were like the suits in <i>A Scanner Darkly</i>, constantly flickering until they were shown. Redefining the words "fact" and "real" to only include shown cards. Which. Well, it <i>is</i> (demonstrably) possible to use the words "fact" and "real" that way but that wasn't what <b>I</b> meant.<br/><br/>There are <i>many</i> roleplaying games that <i>do</i> work that way (things only becoming real when they are shown). And that's perfectly coherent, <i>for them</i>. If you're utterly used to such games your mind is gonna melt when you hear about a game that worx differently. As mine did when "mirror story".                        </div>

Yeah, you're right. Can you think of some examples where there's been peli/leikki semantic drift? Arguably roolipeli has elements of both.                        </div>

                            "Roolileikki" is what some people do in the privacy of their bedroom.<br/>"Roolipeli" is a roleplaying game.<br/><br/>I think that many computer games qualify more as toys - Minecraft, I hear (but have never played it), maybe Dwarf fortress and various city-building games. An old game was The incredible machine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incredible_Machine_" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incredible_Machine_</a>(series).<br/>Many of these games have a "game"-like mode, but also a mode for playing around. Yet all of them are called games. I am not sure which verb would be used for interacting with them.<br/><br/>Sorry, I can not give a satisfactory answer to this. I am a bit removed from Finnish children's culture at the moment.                        </div>

                            Okay. There’s a lot to do here.<br/><br/>Before I go any further, I just want to make something very clear. I am not here to defend a comprehensive model that I have made up. I am here to formulate a new model in public in the hopes that others can point out flaws in logic and inconsistencies with reality as I make them in the hopes of eventually creating a coherent, useful model.<br/><br/>I have changed my mind considerably already in this thread, and I will continue to do so as I examine my own statements and the points that others bring up. So please don’t think that I (or accuse me of) “moving goal posts” as we discuss this. I will do my best to point out when I have changed my mind about a previously stated proposition, but since a lot of my thinking on this occurs while driving, eating, etc. and I end up coming back to my computer later with pages of debate in my head, I might forget to explicitly point out when a change has occurred. Please point this out – “But earlier you said ________” and I will either explain why those things are not contradictory, or I’ll confirm that my earlier statement is no longer true of the model.<br/><br/>So here are some changes in my thinking that have occurred since last night:<br/><br/>I am changing the term JAZZING to ARTING. I previously put a great deal of importance on the communal and improvisational nature of the activity. I no longer think these integral to the activity, and the use of JAZZING connotates that they are.<br/><br/>ARTING, as an activity, does not have to be communal (a single individual writing a novel is ARTING). And I would argue that all ARTING is improvisational in its nature, at some point in the creation process. That the improvisation occur at the time of performance and consumption need not be true. (This may conflict with some people’s understanding of the meaning of “improvisational”. This might be a problem. We might need to substitute another word, but I don’t know what it is yet.)<br/><br/>Also…<br/><br/>“Leikki” and “Peli” are no longer useful terms in this model. From my perspective, they are both just value judgements about one type of activity – “Playing a Game” – GAMING in my model. The amount of and complexity of structure, the explicitness of the goal of play, the nature of the goal (competition or “just having fun” or something else entirely) and even the amount of adherence to the previously agreed upon structure (rules) don’t change the fundamental nature of the activity. They are both just examples of playing a game.<br/><br/> So…<br/><br/>Before I begin to address specific points raised by others, I want to restate both the reason for the creation of this model in the first place, and the current claims made by it. In doing so, I will probably be addressing some the points made and questions raised by others.<br/><br/>First off, what am I trying to accomplish:<br/><br/>I believe that much of the arguing and disagreement in the current debate over the existence and nature of the Game State is due to misunderstandings caused by the vague nature of language (words mean different things in different contexts, and as humans we tend to automatically assume that our interlocutor understands the context in which they are being used. We also assume that the way our particular language categorizes entities is based on an understanding of the objective nature of those entities, when really it’s due to history, culture, and often flawed and unexamined ideas of how things work. As intelligent individuals, I believe we are all aware that these assumptions are incorrect, but it’s easy to miss when we are making them when we don’t step back far enough from the conversation.)<br/><br/>“GAME”, “PLAY”, “ROLE-PLAYING”, and many other words are being used (and have been used for 40+ years) to describe different aspects of our hobby, along with our assumptions about language, lead us to believe things that are not necessarily true, like that ROLEPLAYING GAMES are a type of GAME, because the title we use to identify that activity happens to contain the word GAME. <br/><br/>Other assumptions might include the idea that PLAYING Monopoly and PLAYING a piano share some fundamental connection, because the English language happens to use the word PLAY to describe the same activities. We end up trying to shoehorn both activities into categories under the heading TYPES OF PLAY, just because our particular language uses the same word to describe those activities.<br/><br/>Another assumption might be that because we use the word PERFORMANCE to describe the delivery of a work of art to an audience in the realms of theatre and music, and not the delivery of a work of art to an audience through writing, painting, or sculpture, that the TIME AT WHICH THAT DELIVERY OCCURS is somehow important and must be accounted for.<br/><br/>I realize that much (if not all) that I just said is just Freshman Semiotics 101, and some of you are rolling your eyes at someone trying to remind the trigonometry class that 2+2=4, but I want all those things out there so that we’re at least on the same page.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Over the last weeks, I have seen debate between two groups. We will call them THE GAMESTATERS and THE SUBS (for subjective). These are bad terms. I make no claims that the terms say anything about the groups or their beliefs. They’re just convenient terms to describe two groups of people. I also don’t claim that any single statement, belief, or argument is agreed upon by all members of a group. Trying to define the groups’ positions isn’t important right now.<br/><br/>I believe I have seen some of the following views expressed by some GAMESTATERS (not necessarily in these words – I don’t feel like digging through thread for quotes):<br/><br/>1.	The SUBS’ arguments against our model are reactionary and they are clinging to FORGE-derived theories out of stubbornness or misplaced reverence. <br/><br/>2.	The SUBS seem like they are trying to gaslight us – they pretend the answers we give to their questions are inadequate when they are obviously adequate and prove our position.<br/><br/>3.	The SUBS don’t understand our model because they are ignorant of how games work. They need to go back and get a better grounding in the theories of gameplay.<br/><br/>I believe I have seen some of the following views expressed by some SUBS:<br/><br/>1.	If one is to take some of the GAMESTATERS’ proclamations at face value, they are claims that defy reality. They are arguing that imaginary entities exist in the real world.<br/><br/>2.	The GAMESTATERS are arguing that a particular tool that can be used to facilitate a certain type of playstyle is somehow the basis for all roleplaying, and that tool is present in all roleplaying. They are mistaking their preferences for objective fact.<br/><br/>There are other things, and some might belief that these views are being misrepresented, but I believe that at least some of the people in these groups have claimed these things. I am working under the assumption that everyone involved is arguing in good faith.<br/><br/>I believe my model explains how these misunderstandings are occurring. <br/><br/> </div>

<b>PART 1: ROLEPLAY, GAMING, and ARTING</b><br/><br/>ROLEPLAYING is an activity that involves participating in (at least) two separate activities simultaneously. I currently make no claims that these two activities are the totality of what is happening when one is ROLEPLAYING. There may be other activities equally fundamental.<br/><br/>These two activities I claim to exist are:<br/><br/>GAMING: An activity that can be examined and discussed using the theories, vocabulary, and concepts that can be applied to activities like chess, poker, hide-and-go-seek, and Super Mario Bros. [NEW THING I WILL HAVE TO PROVE LATER: This activity operates according to PRESCRIPTIVE RULES.]<br/><br/>ARTING: An activity that can be examined and discussed using the theories, vocabulary, and concepts that can be applied to activities like screenwriting, musical composition, choreography, acting, playing an instrument, and dancing. [NEW THING I WILL HAVE TO PROVE LATER: This activity operates according to DESCRIPTIVE RULES.]<br/><br/>Theories, models, and observations about one of these two sub-activities will not necessarily hold true for the other. I might even propose that they never do (this is yet to be proven).<br/><br/>Theories, models, and observations about one of these two sub-activities that are applied to the entirety of the activity of ROLEPLAYING due to the mistaken belief that one of the sub-categories is the entirety of ROLEPLAYING and the other is a smaller activity within it (ARTING is a part of GAMING, or GAMING is a part of ARTING) will lead to confusion and misunderstanding, as it will invariably conflict with the personal experience of those who employ rules and techniques that apply to the other sub-category.<br/><br/>One primary cause of these mistakes is that someone four decades ago called the focus of our hobby, “Role Playing Games,” and that title stuck. Role Playing Games aren’t Games. Role Playing Games are activities that involve both playing a game and producing an artistic product. When you apply an observation about the game being played during a Role Playing Game Activity, to the entire activity, you are making a false observation.<br/><br/><b>ANALOGY TIME!</b><br/><br/><i>*For the purposes of this analogy, we’re discussing an automatic transmission. Bringing up gears and clutches and cruise control does not invalidate my analogy or my model. It just proves that ROLEPLAYING is not actually DRIVING A CAR. We already know that. That’s why this is an analogy. </i><br/><br/>When one is DRIVING A CAR [ROLEPLAYING], one is engaging in at least two activities. One is USING THE PEDALS [GAMING] and the other STEERING [ARTING]. Both are done simultaneously while DRIVING A CAR. Statements that mistake USING THE PEDALS for DRIVING A CAR will make no sense to those are discussing STEERING or DRIVING A CAR as a whole.<br/><br/><b>For example: </b><br/><br/>“When you’re USING THE PEDALS and you push down on something, it either makes the car go faster or slower,” is true.<br/><br/>“When you’re DRIVING A CAR and you push down on something, it either makes the car go faster or slower,” is untrue.<br/><br/>Those who mistake USING THE PEDALS for DRIVING A CAR will see no difference in these statements.<br/><br/>Those who push down on their steering wheel and see no change in speed will believe that the people making that statement are out of touch with reality.<br/><br/>Those who would argue that STEERING is only for artsy hippy types and that it’s not an integral part of DRIVING A CAR are wrong. If one chooses not to touch the steering wheel while DRIVING A CAR, the car is still being STEERED [insert Rush quote here]. Whether one cares about where the car ends up or whether the car crashes is a matter of creative agenda, not of function. You can DRIVE A CAR without caring about or giving thought to STEERING. STEERING is still occurring. Those whose creative agenda includes caring about where the car ends up will be very disappointed in this type of gameplay.<br/><br/>In the same way that you can’t DRIVE A CAR without STEERING occurring, you can’t DRIVE A CAR without USING THE PEDALS. You can turn the wheel back and forth, but without USING THE PEDALS, no DRIVING A CAR will occur.<br/><br/>Someone is going to point out that the relationships between USING THE PEDALS and STEERING are not identical. They are right!<br/><br/>When you choose not to USE THE PEDALS, you are not DRIVING A CAR. STEERING cannot occur, because you have no movement. You can turn the wheel, but nothing will happen. The car will not change direction.<br/><br/>When you choose to USE THE PEDALS, you are suddenly DRIVING A CAR. STEERING automatically occurs, because the car is moving in a particular direction. Choosing not to engage with the steering wheel is still a choice to how the car will be STEERED.<br/><br/>Once you are DRIVING A CAR, you are engaging in both activities.<br/><br/><b>DRIVING A CAR requires you to USE THE PEDALS.<br/><br/>STEERING occurs automatically once one is DRIVING A CAR.<br/><br/>Because PUSHING ON THE PEDALS is required to DRIVE A CAR, and DRIVING A CAR automatically results in STEERING, doesn’t mean that STEERING is part of PUSHING ON THE PEDALS or that statements about PUSHING ON THE PEDALS will apply in any meaningful way to STEERING.</b><br/><br/>Much confusion is due to the fact that, in the world of this analogy, Henry Ford decided to call DRIVING A CAR, “PEDALING A CAR” instead, and it stuck. Now people think that everything that applies to pedals applies to driving.<br/><br/>In addition-<br/><br/>People keep saying things like, “When you push down on the gas pedal, it causes the wheel to turn.”<br/><br/>They push down on the pedal. Someone standing outside the car looks down at the wheels and says, “Yes. That checks out.”<br/><br/>Someone inside the car looks down at the steering wheel, pushes the pedal, and the wheel does not move (their alignment is great). That person says, “No. You obviously don’t understand how cars work.”<br/><br/>Neither side is arguing in bad faith.<br/><br/>I hope this makes things clearer.<br/><br/>I will further describe how PRESCRIPTIVE RULES and DESCRIPTIVE RULES might be a criteria of determining which actions in ROLEPLAYING apply to GAMING or ARTING.<br/><br/>I will also discuss the THREE-TIER MODEL and how ROLEPLAYING relates to PRODUCT and THIRD-TIER DESIGN.                        </div>

My Model's answer to this problem is that you are making a statement that is true about GAMING D&amp;D, but not ARTING D&amp;D. You keep stating that your statement applies to ROLEPLAYING D&amp;D, which includes both GAMING D&amp;D and ARTING D&amp;D.<br/><br/>This doesn't jibe with many people's experience of ROLEPLAYING D&amp;D, because there are many times during this activity where they are ARTING and the statement about objectivity doesn't apply.<br/><br/>Any statement about how ROLEPLAYING D&amp;D works must be applicable both to Poker and <i>Hamlet</i>. Your statement does not apply to <i>Hamlet</i>.<br/><br/>Your statement that some RPGs work one way (poker) and others don't (solipsistic Scanner Darkley Games) is, according to my model, false.<br/><br/>Your statements about GameState are <b>true</b> about about the GAMING activity found in all RPGS.<br/><br/>Your statements about GameState are <b>false</b> about the ARTING activity found in all RPGs. There is no GameState because ARTING is not a GAME.<br/><br/>Your statements about GameState can't apply to any RPGs in totality because they are false about the ARTING part of RPGs.  ROLE PLAYING <del>GAMES</del> aren't GAMES. One of the activities involved in ROLE PLAYING <del>GAMES</del> is playing a GAME.<br/><br/>According to my model, any rules about whether something exists in the PRODUCT (formerly SIS) are part of ARTING.<br/><br/>Rules about whether something exists in the GameState are concerned with GAMING.<br/><br/>You are, from your detractors' POV, pointing at a framed picture of a Jack of Hearts and proclaiming, "All 52 cards in a deck are in that frame." This is obviously false.<br/><br/>At the same time, from your POV, your detractors are pointing at a deck of cards and saying they're Quantum Scanner Darkly cards until you look at them. This is obviously false.<br/><br/>40 years of RPG theory have claimed that a deck of cards and a framed picture are the same thing and behave according to the same rules. They don't. <br/><br/>This is why there is confusion. This is what my model is trying to correct.                        </div>

                            If you frame the deck, you can no longer manipulate it or play a game with it. Only the card on top matters, because it’s the only one we can see in the frame. We can now only look at it as art judging it on aesthetics. There is no game state anymore. You can no more ascribe a gamestate to a framed deck than you can ascribe a gamestate to The Mona Lisa. In order to be able to describe the contents of the deck in relation to a game, you have to get them out of the frame and play a game with them.<br/><br/>That’s the crux of what I’m trying to say. The fiction of an RPG can’t be examined or described by game theory anymore than it can describe a song or a film. It requires a different set of terms and theories. <br/><br/>That’s the problem I’m having with you describing the SIS as a subset of the GameState. Once it’s part of the SIS, it’s part of a fiction we’re creating, not part of a game that we’re playing. GameState only describes things that are part of a game. <br/><br/>We can’t describe the SIS with game terms. We have to use things like balance, pacing, perspective, language choice, etc.<br/><br/>Analogies aren’t working to communicate this. I will try to create an real-world example using an RPG. I’ll get back to you.<br/><br/>In the meantime;
<blockquote>(I take a holistic approach to designing my process for art.)</blockquote>
This doesn't make any sense to me in relation to "framing the deck". It doesn't mean anything in relation to how I was using cards in my analogy. I think if you can explain what you are saying with that sentence, it would make a giant difference in understanding where we're talking past each other.                         </div>

There are places and creatures and items there, it is a wondrous place. We can visit it. It is art. Some of this art we have discovered, and Talked About, and Let Each Other Know About. That subset of the MIS is the SIS. The SIS is a cave wall shadow cast by the MIS. “Pacing”, “language”, “perspective”, these things are crude polaroid cameras making feeble attempts to capture the view from the top of that hill. That’s not to say that we don’t work on them too. We do. We polish the mirror. We try to see more clearly.<br/><br/>There is also another type of art. The τέχνη. The ritual. The method. <a href="https://phabricator.kde.org/D10320" rel="nofollow">The process is my true canvas</a>. That’s what belongs in the museum. The images that result are only snapshots, cave wall shadows, forgotten the next day.<br/><br/>Designing rules and designing prep is making an anthill, a powder keg, a petri dish. We wind the clockwork up and we see how it lives.<br/><br/> </div>

                            Making art and playing games are, if not fundamentally similar activities, deeply mutually compatible activities. We can basically always fruitfully apply theories, models and observations developed for one of them to the other.<br/><br/>Gameplay often makes poor art but this isn't the same as saying that we can't consider gameplay in artistic terms. (The opposite, in fact, implicitly.) Art often makes poor gameplay but same thing, we can nevertheless fruitfully consider art in gameplay terms.<br/><br/>If we consider Hamlet to be a game that Shakespeare is playing with his audience, what do we learn about Hamlet? What are the stakes, what are the plays? What do we learn about games? How about if we consider Hamlet to be a game that the acting company is playing with its audience? What moves are they going to lead with, what's their field strategy, what are they going to hold in reserve?<br/><br/>If we consider a shuffled deck of cards to be an implicit dramatic narrative, what do we learn about cards? What do we learn about narratives?<br/><br/>Roleplaying games are games that take a particular art form - fiction - as their medium. They represent not just an overlapping of art and game, but a commonalized, inseperable art-game.<br/><br/>There are any number of art-game forms, even several other fiction-game forms. Roleplaying games aren't very special in this regard.                        </div>

<blockquote class="Quote">If you frame the deck, you can no longer manipulate it or play a game with it. Only the card on top matters, because it’s the only one we can see in the frame. We can now only look at it as art judging it on aesthetics. There is no game state anymore. You can no more ascribe a gamestate to a framed deck than you can ascribe a gamestate to The Mona Lisa. In order to be able to describe the contents of the deck in relation to a game, you have to get them out of the frame and play a game with them.<br/></blockquote>
Mona Lisa still has a state, just like the framed card. The state is not very exciting because it is constant in time. Just like the empty Newtonian universe with no particles is still a physical system, but it is a boring one. In mathematics, the empty set is still a set, but a boring one, and in fact there exists a unique mapping from it to every other set, and there are several other such trivial implications.
<blockquote>That’s the problem I’m having with you describing the SIS as a subset of the GameState. Once it’s part of the SIS, it’s part of a fiction we’re creating, not part of a game that we’re playing. GameState only describes things that are part of a game. <br/></blockquote>
If we want to be precise, then the state space is a collection of propositions, while the SIS consists of credibility and communication. So, technically, we could say that they are completely different kinds of objects.<br/><br/>However, any proposition that is true of things established to be in SIS is also in the game state. This means that to every true proposition concerning the SIS I can associate a particular proposition in the game state, and there is a unique and a canonical way of doing this.<br/><br/>For example: We have established that in the SIS there is a unicorn standing in the glade. Thereby, the game state includes the true proposition "There is unicorn standing in the glade."<br/><br/>This is not very interesting, and typically does not matter, so we just say that the SIS is a subset of the game state.<br/><br/>This is done in mathematics all the time. For example, technically speaking the natural numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, ...) and the real numbers (5, -3.52, square root of 91, minus pi, etc.) are completely different kinds of objects, and, in fact, the kinds of objects the real numbers are depends on their construction. (The real number might be Dedekind cuts or equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences of rational numbers or whatever.)<br/><br/>However, regardless of the way we construct the real numbers, every natural number has a unique corresponding real number. So we go ahead and say that natural numbers are real numbers and in fact we use exactly the same symbol, "2", and word "two", to refer to both the natural number and the real number. This does not cause confusion.<br/><br/>When I want to construct the real numbers, I need to distinguish between the real number "two" and the natural number "two". If I wanted to write some kind of ontological description of what kinds of things there exist in roleplaying games - what is the ontological status of the unicorn in the glade, or the magic powers of its horn (thus far undetermined), etc., then I would have to be more careful and saying that "SIS in a subset of game state" would be a bad idea. However, most of the time, we are not so interested in these foundational issues or metaphysics - we just want to talk about the unicorn in the glade as a random encounter, as something the game master has determined, and as something that has already appeared in play, and maybe as something people dispute due to this being dark fantasy, or maybe as something people have forgotten about, and how these affect play. This does not require metaphysical carefulness.                        </div>

                            I am not terribly interested in the precise ontological model, just as I do not really care how someone imagines their real numbers to be constructed, or just takes them as axiomatic.<br/><br/>Though if someone wants to construct an ontological model of roleplaying from the ground up, I might want to follow or maybe participate.

<blockquote class="Quote">However, any proposition that is true of things established to be in SIS is also in the game state. This means that to every true proposition concerning the SIS I can associate a particular proposition in the game state, and there is a unique and a canonical way of doing this.<br/><br/>For example: We have established that in the SIS there is a unicorn standing in the glade. Thereby, the game state includes the true proposition "There is unicorn standing in the glade."</blockquote>
I want to point out that there actually IS something interesting here.<br/><br/>The GM's read the module up to page 99. She says, "There's a unicorn standing in the glade."<br/><br/>On module page 100, it says, "The horse-figure in the glade isn't a unicorn. It's actually an Equine Doppelgänger."<br/><br/>In the SIS:<br/><code>There's a unicorn standing in the glade.</code><br/><br/>In the Game State:<br/><code>There is no unicorn standing in the glade.<br/>There is an Equine Doppelgänger standing in the glade.</code> </div>

                            Darling it's two things the first is that the game state, in this case the <code>shared-p</code> subset, can have contradictions that we have to resolve and the second is that making rules about the distribution of doppeltrotters in the realm and their tendency to fool characters (and those character's players) is something that will give us a pretty interesting &amp; hot SIS<br/><br/>Like, tagging <a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">@Aviatrix</a> since she's the only one on S-G that has had to suffer through a real session with me, but, I'll say things like "You are under the impression that you see a four-legged, one-horned equine <i>with at least one white side</i>".<br/> </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Jeph">@Jeph</a> true, and I almost wrote about that, but decided to leave it out for simplicity.<br/><br/>In traditional gaming, it is widely understood that game master communicates what the characters perceive and know, unless otherwise mentioned. The uncertainty and so on are implicitly included.<br/><br/>(With new players, I try to be more explicit about this, explicitly saying that "there are no more doors out of the room. I mean, maybe there is a secret door, you wouldn't know, but at least you can't see any right away." if they ask whether there are any doors leading away from the room.)<br/><br/>So, yes, the more precise statement in the game state and, implicitly, the SIS, is that there is something on the glade that looks like a unicorn. The game state also includes whether the unicorn is or is not the actual unicorn. However, the game state still includes everything in the shared imagined space, because players act based on that information.                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> <br/><br/>Before I say anything else, I want to apologize. Looking back over my  posts, I can see how they could be construed as dismissive. Please know that was not my intent.<br/><br/>So what is my intent?<br/><br/>My intent with this whole exercise is to try and come to an understanding of how groups of people, both intelligent and versed in the subject, can have such differing observations and explanations for the same activity, so much so that one group's declaration about what is happening during the activity is so incongruent with the other group's experience and understanding of said activity that it results in incredulity.<br/><br/>I believed it was a matter of linguistics and the vagueness of language. By creating new terms and definitions, I was trying to create tools with which we would better be able to describe the models we are advocating by avoiding misunderstanding. I still think this might be the case.<br/><br/>It could also be the case that we are understanding one another's intended meaning, but that our goals/agendas/life experiences/lenses through which we view the world are so different that the debate is less about our mutual hobby and more about how we determine truth.<br/><br/>If that's the case, it's probably best to just shake hands and agree to disagree.<br/><br/>Or one of us could just be wrong. I could even be me! <img alt=":blush:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/blush.png" title=":blush:"/> <br/><br/>Anyway, the last day or so has given me time to reexamine various people's responses and reevaluate the model I'm been constructing.<br/><br/>My model is mostly bunk. But I think the three-tier thing still might have legs.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Jeph">@Jeph</a> 's post from way back asked some questions about my separation of the tiers (Game vs. Art) that I tried to answer with my ideas about Prescribed vs. Described rules, as I presented in the card analogy thread. When trying to actually apply it to a real world situation, it didn't hold up.<br/><br/>Dead end.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/lumpley">@lumpley</a> 's thoughts on art and games pretty much convinced me that my attempts to define the difference between Tier 1 and Tier 2 as one of "Game" vs. "Art" were barking up the wrong tree.<br/><br/>The split between Tier 1 and 2 is not what I originally thought it was. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">@Thanuir</a> has said a lot about gamestate that has cleared up exactly what is being discussed, and that has cleared up something for me about the nature of this type of model and its relation to what I perceive to be the way that RPGs work.<br/><br/>Then 2097 said something that might be the most enlightening thing I have seen:
<blockquote>a type of hyper-sollipsistic game where all propositions are false until they've been heard</blockquote>
This. This is the definition of RPGs that I've been trying to communicate without knowing it. Just replace "<b>heard</b>" with "<b>accepted</b>".<br/><br/>I proclaim this is a true definition of all RPGs. It's not a statement of preference or value, it's just statement of function.<br/><br/>It's not the only one. It's flippant and it's reductive. It's akin to defining a tree as "one type of thing that produces oxygen." The only thing it says about RPGs is what they produce...Fiction.<br/><br/>All RPGs are, regardless of the system used, are a way to decide what happens in the fictional product produced. They certainly have many other goals and functions, but this is one of them.<br/><br/>We are having a misunderstanding about the SIS. I think this misunderstanding goes way back.<br/><br/>In 2097's model (correct me if I'm wrong), the SIS is a subset of the MIS. It affects and is affected by other parts of the GameState. It is in no way separate.<br/><br/>I understand why this is now due to the various explanations given about GameState. In this model, the SIS is "what is known by the players". Cool. It works. I now agree.<br/><br/>So here's the Three-Tier Model as I now see it. No more Arting and Gaming.<br/><br/><b>TIER 1: System (Game) - including the MIS, and thus the SIS<br/><br/>TIER 2: Social Contract-based Agreed upon translation of information output from the System to fictional information for input into the PRODUCT.<br/><br/>TIER 3: PRODUCT</b><br/><br/>The System is basically just the same definition as from the BCBP. I'll explain.<br/><br/>The SIS from the GameState theory is not the SIS from the BCBP.<br/><br/>The SIS from the BCBP is what I am now calling the PRODUCT. <br/><br/><br/>Whether you are using 2097e (which is entirely described by the gamestate, including the SIS as a s-flippable subset of that state) or you're using one of those sets of dice that just has icons of houses and trees on it, and you're just using that as inspiration, we are still doing just what was described above - choosing what goes into the product.<br/><br/>We are choosing which prepositions about the fictional product are true and false. All the system is, is an agreed-upon "improvisation aid" that gives us output that we choose to add or dismiss on a social level. <br/><br/>This is not to be dismissive of the system. The system is important, but for the purposes of my model it could be RoleMaster or just flipping a coin. The function within the Tier model is the same. <br/><br/>The point I'm trying to make is:<br/><br/><b>The SIS (the information from the system that has been made known to players) is not the PRODUCT (the information about the fiction that has been accepted as valid by the group.)</b><br/><br/>EXAMPLE:<br/><br/>There's a cake in the fridge. According to the GameState in the system being used, the cake is there regardless of whether the PCs find it or not, because that is an aspect of the agreed upon system (which includes the GameState or <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span></b> the GameState, that seems unclear depending on who's explaining it). The cake is in the MIS, but not the SIS. The cake exists in Tier 1.<br/><br/>In the PRODUCT, the cake is not there if the players never encountered it and <b>accepted it as part of the PRODUCT</b>. No more than a character with no screen time is in a particular episode of a TV show. It's either there in the PRODUCT or not. In order to be there, it has to be added by the group (TIER 2)<br/><br/>The disagreement, I believe, is that we were confusing SIS (information in the GameState that the players have been exposed to - Tier 1) and PRODUCT (what the players accept as part of the fiction created for consumption - Tier 3).<br/><br/>I believe what was meant by "SIS" in the BCBP is what I am calling PRODUCT here. I'm pretty sure the definition of the SIS has always been what I call the PRODUCT. (<a href="/forums/profile/lumpley">@lumpley</a> , correct me on this if I'm wrong)<br/><br/>We can, if we want, change PRODUCT back to SIS and find another term for the information in the gamestate which has been made known to the players.<br/><br/>There's a lot more to get into, but I won't have time until tomorrow.<br/><br/>In short, this is why I think there has been a misunderstanding:<br/><br/>True Statements about TIER 1 were being confused with statements about TIER 3.<br/><br/>The unseen cake exists and is just as real as anything in TIER 1.<br/><br/>There is no cake in TIER 3, unless the players have encountered it and accepted it as part of the PRODUCT.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>
