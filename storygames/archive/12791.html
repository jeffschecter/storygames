I need help making some English Manga recommendations, and so I'm asking around.<br/><br/>I'm basically looking for recommendations of manga to go with <a href="http://www.tenra-rpg.com" rel="nofollow">Tenra Bansho</a>, so I was thinking "historical-ish", "preferably asian themed", etc. I can think of a hundred movie, anime or J-drama recs, but racking my brains on actual manga recs.<br/><br/>I'm looking for manga that fit these criteria:<br/><br/>* Available in English, in book form.<br/>* Has awesome character drama and at least some action.<br/>* Not titilating bullshit, nor a vehicle to express artist's panty/tit fetish (see "Bastard!!", "Tenjo Tenge" - A real shame on the latter, the manga might have been good otherwise)<br/><br/>From there, I'm looking for:<br/><br/>* Anything manga-ish. Doesn't have to be from Japan. Korean or Chinese Manwa is totally OK.<br/>* Doesn't have to focus on historic Japan. Western history (Vinland Saga) or even contemporary (Eden) is fine, but the further it drifts from historical the less I can use it.<br/><br/>This is particularly difficult for me. I am a manga-eating monster. But all the manga I have or love to death are:<br/>1) Comedy<br/>2) Slice-of-life<br/>3) Biographic (<a href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20070401x2.html" rel="nofollow">Saibara Rieko</a>, Darling wa Gaikokujin, etc)<br/>4) Feel-good/Heartwarming<br/><br/>The ones I already have are:<br/>Blade of the Immortal<br/>Shigurui (unfortunately only available as scanlation, so disqualified kinda)<br/>Ooku: The Inner Chambers ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8Coku:_The_Inner_Chambers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u014coku:_The_Inner_Chambers</a> )<br/>Maaaaaaaaaybe Vagabond<br/>Sumomomo Momomo (contemporary, and kind of gag-y, but its serious bits are awesome and dramatic)<br/>Basilisk (but more than this, I'd rec the movie version "Shinobi Heart Under Blade", and yet, I'm only looking for manga recs...)<br/>I'd rec Twelve Kingdoms, but the manga is simply an adaptation of the much better anime, and not even a good adaptation.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287831/#Comment_287831" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-20T09:55:05+00:00" title="August 20, 2010  9:55AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 20, 2010 9:56AM by Elizabeth.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you read Bride of the Water God?

This is great stuff. I was able to put a lot of these to use.<br/><br/>OK, I wasn't thinking of commenting on each manga rec, but here goes, in order as listed in the thread:<br/><br/>Naruto: Surprisingly YES. I tend not to like the JUMP-style manga treadmill (you think the supplement treadmill in RPGs is bad? We ain't got shit on Shonen JUMP's manga treadmill of endless fight subplots which have ruined countless manga since 1980). But it's solid, has great story elements buried under and around the fights, etc. Alexander Neuman also totally sold me on watching Naruto on Hulu as well.<br/><br/>Dororo/Mushishi - Good calls. I used to read Mushishi when it came out, it was serialized in "Afternoon", which I had a subscription to (even in the US) for years: It's the same mangabon that featured Blade of the Immortal, Genshiken, BLAME!, EDEN, Rinshi!! Ekoda-chan, The Pigeon Bride, Historie, Vinland Saga and others.<br/>On it's own, Mushishi tends to get kinda repetitive/bland after a long while, but it really is a striking, innovative and definitely laid-back story.<br/><br/>Shaman Warrior: Yep. I have a volume of it, it's a great Manhua. I plan on looking into even more Korean series soon.<br/>Vagabond: Yes and No. Good story. Hell, great story even. But slooooooow.<br/><br/>Rafu: My next post will be about "Bastard!!", since that warrants Special Attention. :-)<br/><br/>Buddha: Excellent manga, but not really for this rec here. It's a great historical look at the Buddha, and a classic manga at that. Nothing really ahistoric or action-y about it, though. I still regard it as a high recommendation, though.<br/><br/>Lone Wolf: Pretty solid rec.<br/>Sayonara: Interesting, a shinsengumi tale. Looks like a companion piece to the movie "When the Last Sword is Drawn" (on Netflix)<br/>Not afamiliar with Phoenix, will look into that.<br/>Tekkonkinkreet: Not sure for this project, but it has been added to my next "buying used manga in bulk from Japan" order list.<br/>Berserk is OK, too long maybe.<br/>And yeah, Vinland Saga is good. I even like the companion comedy manga about the main character's sister.<br/>Rurouni Kenshin: Can you believe that I've never seen an episode, read an issue? Need to correct that.<br/>Gasaraki: The setup is awesome, and honestly as a visual piece it's a great reference for what in the game are called "Kimen Armours", armours (mecha) that are mass-produced instead of "crafted" by sorcerer-blacksmiths. But after all that awesome with pan-dimensional Noh theatre dancing... whatta letdown in the end...<br/><br/>Carl: Twelve Kingdoms is in fact the greatest anime ever created. I have wrestled people on the conviction of that stance!<br/>And yeah, the novels are decent/okay. For all that great setting she created, the novels (in Japanese) are basically a vehicle for her to throw out bizarre, ancient Chinese pictographs for terms no longer ever used at the reader until their eyes glaze over.<br/>Lady Snowblood: Sweet catch.<br/>Not familiar with the others, but looking into them (Kurogane, Kaze Hikaru). Am familiar with Otogi Zoshi, and for all I love the Heian period and works ballsy enough to use it for a setting... Snoozefest.<br/><br/>Mikes's Recs: All interesting. Not familiar with Arata, Shin Angyo Onshi, but will look into it.<br/><br/>And good call on Inuyasha, at least one volume anyway. There are a class of characters called "Ayakashi" in the game, which are essentally like Inuyasha or Vampire Princess Miyu.<br/><br/>3x3 Eyes: Interesting, haven't looked back in years.<br/><br/>Trigun: Also good call. It's got a lot of style over substance, but sometimes games like that are fun to run and play too. Trigun Maximum is cool as well, in like an Emo-version of Trigun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289207/#Comment_289207" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T11:44:32+00:00" title="August 27, 2010 11:44AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gintama seems to be a good fit for Tenra (except it is comedic), but I am unsure if it is available for sale in English and I am not sure if in its HUGE span it delves into "fan-service".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack" title="amnesiack"><img alt="amnesiack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1012/830711303_f5d26761f6_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack">amnesiack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289225/#Comment_289225" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T12:27:13+00:00" title="August 27, 2010 12:27PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>I used to read Mushishi when it came out, it was serialized in "Afternoon", which I had a subscription to (even in the US) for years: It's the same mangabon that featured Blade of the Immortal, Genshiken, BLAME!, EDEN, Rinshi!!

No real fan service at all. Not really very Tenra-ish, IMO. <br/><br/>But it is absolutely <i>hilarious</i>. Essentially it's a pisstake of modern Japanese culture (and very often, a pisstake of shonen manga itself), set in Edo Japan when the Shinsengumi were running around, but the historical setting is really only a backdrop and provides a little structure for the utterly outrageous stuff that goes on - no need to really know anything about it. <br/><br/>Gin Tama makes me laugh like no other comedy manga has ever done. Some chapters may fall a little flat when Sorachi does the "pulling the heart strings" stories, but some are pure comedy gold.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289809/#Comment_289809" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T09:09:28+00:00" title="August 30, 2010  9:09AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2010 9:10AM by JuddG.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Montesa</cite>Not really very Tenra-ish, IMO.</blockquote>\nI loved the anime and will look for the manga (I prefer to read rather than watch).<br/><br/>My reason for thinking it was a fit was that Gintama is Edo Period plus technology where TBZ is technology plus Edo Period.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290689/#Comment_290689" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T21:17:04+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  9:17PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            LOL, been a bit longer with the reply than I hoped!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rafu</cite>I tremble in anger at your dislike of<i>Bastard!!</i>and your bundling it together with the abysmal<i>Tenjo Tenge</i>(only<i>Crying Freeman</i>, of all titles a series can be compared to, would be more offensive than<i>Tenjo Tenge</i>)! The un/holy power of heavy metal does<i>not</i>flow strong in you, obviously.</blockquote>\nHeh, funny you should mention that: I LOVED the Bastard!! anime, it was one of the ones like Ranma, FotNS and Ninja Scroll that pulled my into the world of anime (and then manga, after which I left most anime behind). It was awesome, only a tiny bit "ecchi", and between all the heavy metal references (almost as many music references as Jojo's Bizarre Adventure), I totally rocked out to that anime: The perfect intersection of anime and RPG.<br/><br/>Then, a few years later, I found myself in Japan. By then, Bastard!! manga 17-18 or so were out, and I picked up the latest few: I was kinda awestruck, dumbfounded even:<br/><br/>* The manga was really graphic and bloody, far more than the manga. Heroes were being torn in half, getting their arms ripped off, dying in giant angel blasts, etc. Still, I was like "OK, this is still pretty awesome. Obviously this is the Moving and Shaking Shit Up arc or something".<br/><br/>* The art was astounding: His portrayal of these weird alien angels, with their bizarre sideways-font script talking and double-pupil eyes, made them look like What If Cthulhu Were a Protoss God? Awesome, groundbreaking stuff.<br/><br/>* And every single woman in the manga had HUGE tits. And plenty of shored-off shirts, even as they were being killed. The princess, and Yoko (the main heroine) also somehow both developed huge knockers, all jangling around from page to page.<br/><br/>Cut back to a few years later, and I was in Japan again for the long haul. By then, there were something like 30-40 Bastard!!s: I started flipping through them, and basically it became kinda clear that the plot had left the station, that there's nothing but somewhat kinda lame action in order for more HUGE TITS to appear. <br/><br/>I asked my friend about it (actually, he kinda told me when he was drunk): Satoru was friends with the author and met the team a few times (he had weird connections, everyone from the staff of Trigun to his good friend Yonekura Kengo, who I helped sell her porno dojins at a komiket in the late 90s), and had been like a HUGE fan, tapped into the huge fan community of Bastard!!... and even though he kept buying them, he basically said the series was so full of shit at that point that not even the hardcore fans really care about it anymore: Apparently there were one or more out-of-left-field time travel arcs, etc, and pretty soon all veils were dropped, and it basically became the Big Tit Fetish Delivery Unit of a manga. <br/><br/>Too bad. It was "JUMP'd", but not through "fight arcs", but through boobs.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's kinda interesting: When the early manga started getting released as comics, I actually worked with Jason ("King of RPGs") at Viz, writing articles in the comic about the Japanese RPG scene, RPGs, etc. Pretty fun times. The comic was eventually cancelled, luckily far before the descent into shit.<br/><br/>Also, Crying Freeman! Heh, I've actually got a lot of love for this crazy-ass manga. It's got nudity, and a lot of it, but most "targeted at older folks/men" manga in those lines/companies do: Golgo, Tenkuu No Mon, etc. It, too, is a kind of fanservice... but the thing about it is that it's clearly not fetishistic: There's not like "one type of woman" (or one feature: Tits, Young Girls, Girls with Glasses, etc) that it featured over and over again: In fact, one of the main characters is like a 350 pound assassin lady (B\xe1i Y\xe1 Sh\xe0n), and she's naked. A Lot. And while the pics can be a little disturbing in that regard, at least it's "variety". Men are naked, women are naked, japanese, white people, chinese, black people, are are naked, fucking and dying. I'd have probably tossed the manga aside as trash if every single character was like another big-breasted Japanese chick conforming to some fetish subgroup within that big-breasted fetish group. But I digress...\n<blockquote>Plus, since you already have<i>Blade of the Immortal</i>in your list, you're done \u2014 what else can you possibly need?<br/><br/>(<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Full-disclosure, as the Americans say</span>: I have been professionally associated with both<i>Bastard!!</i>and<i>Blade of the Immortal</i>in my former job.)</blockquote>\nTrue re BOTI. Interesting fact tho, for the longest time I ran the largest BOTI fan page on the planet ( www.bladeoftheimmortal.net ), but kinda gave up after I stopped buying Afternoon, and after the insanely long prison-arc which, after introducing yet more main characters in a kind of George RR Martin loop, basically killed my passion for it. Too bad. The early story arcs, pretty much right up to the prison arc, were awesome tho. I'll catch up after the last issue is drawn. He's been saying "It's drawing to a close" since 1997, and as of 2005 he said "this is the last story arc" (it wasn't, really).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290696/#Comment_290696" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T21:39:02+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  9:39PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: amnesiack</cite>0_o  That list includes some of my favorite manga from the last 15 years (Blame!, EDEN, Genshiken).

It is hands-down the best combination of feelgood and slice-of-life that I know of, perhaps second only to Azumanga Daioh. The only problem is that it's not available in English... the good news is this: The anime is coming out this fall season in Japan:<br/>( <a href="http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/soremachi/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/soremachi/</a><br/>What that means is the same thing it meant for Sumomomo-Momomo and other series I like: The anime may very well suck: Not a problem.<br/>Sucky anime or not, if a manga becomes an anime, a US publisher almost always picks up the rights to release the manga, since it has a "track record of success". This is even likelier since the anime is running on Tokyo Broadcasting Station (TBS), like the "NBC of Japan", and not "Anime Satellite Channel Number 138" or something.<br/>So it's just a matter of time until this manga, again my current favorite manga *of all time*, gets translated officially into English. A few years, sure, but not "never" like other series I like.<br/><br/><b>Available in English:</b><br/><br/>LOVE ROMA (one of my all-time faves, and usually <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> when I recommend "feelgood manga" to someone)<br/>Fruits Basket<br/>Azumanga Daioh<br/>Genshiken<br/>Yotsuba-to<br/><br/><b>Japanese:</b><br/>Saint Young Men (Jesus and Buddha share an apartment in Tokyo) (you may be able to find scanlations of the first 12 chapters online, if you look hard enough)<br/>Yukipon no Oshigoto<br/>Rinshi!! Ekoda-chan (NOT feelgood, but great slice of life)<br/>All works by Saibara Rieko <a href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20070401x2.html" rel="nofollow">http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20070401x2.html</a><br/>Sketchbook (you may be able to find scanlations)<br/><br/><b>Other Fun Manga:</b><br/>Sumomomo-Momomo (at one time my favorite manga. Do not watch the shitty anime. The comic is a million times better). Slice of life as well as WoD-style secret ninja societies that control Japan!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293264/#Comment_293264" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-13T17:14:34+00:00" title="September 13, 2010  5:14PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 13, 2010 5:19PM by Mike Montesa.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm pimping stuff I'm associated with here, so if this is inappropriate Andy, please delete this post.<br/><br/>If your tastes run toward more mature-themed <i>seinen</i> manga (and I don't mean just tits and ass, though there is some of that) I'd be remiss if I didn't point out the <a href="http://www.sigikki.com/" rel="nofollow">SigIkki website</a>. Go there and you can read lots of stuff in English online. My personal faves are <i>Bokurano: Ours</i> (which is a truly messed up giant robot story), <i>Dorohedoro</i> (which somehow gives me an Apocalypse World vibe...must be the gas mask) and <i>House of Five Leaves</i>, though I can groove on most of the other titles in there as well (<i>What's The Answer? </i>is a trip).<br/><br/>My tastes run toward the "blood and thunder" end of the spectrum though. It's no surprise I highly recommend <i>Black Lagoon</i>, <i>Jormungand</i>, and Tsutomu Nihei's <i>Biomega</i>.<br/><br/>And for laffs, you've got to read <i>Detroit Metal City</i>!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
