                    I've been working on a game recently, and my initial thoughts and a rough draft are in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2193" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>.  Since then, I fleshed the rules out a bit more, and I've uploaded the file as a pdf to <a href="http://www.catchyourhare.com/files/The%20Prince%20v2%5b1%5d.pdf" rel="nofollow">this site</a>*.  It's only 4 pages, so I'd really appreciate it if anyone could take a look.  It's kind of essential if you are to understand what's coming next.<br/><br/>In that thread, I was asked to give an example of what I thought the actual play might look like, so I wrote up the following:<br/><br/><br/>We begin with 6 players, Amy, Bill, Chris, Darren, Emily, and Fran.<br/>Amy takes the yellow mat, Bill the green, Chris the blue, Darren the purple, Emily the red and Fran the orange.<br/>The scenario describes a situation in which Amy, Bill and Fran are basically friendly to each other, and while Chris, Darren and Emily have it out for Bill and Fran, Emily and Amy are friendly.<br/><br/>Amy: I'm going to throw an extravagant party, and invite General Fenarus.  I'll spend much of the night socializing with him, building our friendship, and making sure I have the military support I may need later.<br/>Darren: Well, I'll oppose that.  I'll accept the invitation that you obviously sent me, but I'll forewarn my cousin, the General, that you may be up to something.  At the party, I will try to keep you away from him while getting his support for myself.<br/>Emily (looking at her low card, and realizing that she probably does not have a chance to win an opposed action): I'm going to give Amy an Assist on her party and friend-making attempts.  Sorry, Darren.<br/><br/>After the other players make their decisions about actions, the cards are revealed.  Amy has the 4 and Emily has the 2.  Darren, on the other hand, has the 5.  This means that Amy's action succeeds.<br/><br/>Amy: Alright.  I spend the night carefully manipulating General Fenarus, making jokes and dropping not-so-subtle hints about what might be in it for him, should he give me his support.  When Darren tries to approach, I signal my agents to interfere.  After a while, I signal my girl to put on her performance.  She walks up to Darren and slaps him, decrying his lecherous sexual advances.<br/>Darren: I'll get you for this!<br/>Emily: I helped with the agent set-up, using some of my own people so that Darren wouldn't recognize them in Amy's court.  When the girl breaks down in front of Darren, I quickly move to comfort her.<br/>Darren: Don't think you're not on the list, Em.  I thought you were my friend!<br/><br/>Amy writes down â€œGeneral Fenarus' respect and assistanceâ€ as her 2-point advantage.<br/>Emily writes down â€œImpressive planning and respect of the courtâ€ as her 1-point advantage.<br/>Darren doesn't write any advantage down.<br/><br/><br/>Paul Czege's concern was that there wasn't much to make sure that the players engaged with the imaginary stuff going on in the game, but I think some of that may be fixed in the latest draft, where I explicitly lay out who describes things and when, and give a bit more flavor with regards to the setting material.<br/>I would really appreciate come feedback, especially with respect to the issues that Paul and Bryan had.<br/><br/>*Edit: That link is now directly to the pdf, currently being hosted by Graham, which I greatly appreciate.                </div>

Cool.  Thanks for hosting it.  I'll take a look at google docs, since the format is much less important than the text itself.

I'm glad to hear you like the idea of the game.  I'm a bit wobbly on the execution, because this approach is so far out to me, but with some solid playtesting I think it's got a lot of potential.<br/><br/>There is definitely a "low-on-detail" aspect to the game, which clicks nicely with the short time frame the game I'm shooting for.  I don't really have any issue with the scene being played out, but I'm kind of at a loss of where the players for the other characters in the scene would come.  There is no GM in the game... perhaps it's something that the other players could do?  Maybe it would just be as simple as the players adding detail themselves, and just taking roles as they see fit, as long as they follow the results of the card flip.                        </div>
