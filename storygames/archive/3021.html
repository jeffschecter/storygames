Having never made a card game, I thought that someone might be interested in hearing a few thoughts about the process from an absolute beginner. It was/is a huge challenge to design, make, and even playtest the game. A worthwhile challenge if you're into designing games.<br/><br/>First, what I've done in game design before: I've written a few board games, had one published, and I've written a bunch of rpgs with only two of them seeing a ton of action. One of which was used on a dial-up BBS in the 80s by more than just my group. The others are mainly played by my groups at various times, and two recent ones have seen more playtesting than other ones. I also incorporate games into the instruction I do for work, both paddling instruction and photography workshops. <br/>So, as you can tell and probably know if you read my posts, I'm not a big hot-shot game designer, just a hack who thinks that it's a fun pass time.<br/><br/>With all that said, designing a card game was really hard.<br/><br/>This is what I did:<br/>1. Because I found Zombie Rally really fun, I analyzed the make-up of the deck. I.e. counted the numbers of each card.<br/>2. I came up with a concept. The concept was to steal Zombie Rallies main mechanics and make a gladiatorial combat game.<br/>3. Brainstormed ideas, which morphed the gladiator game into a steampunk war game.<br/>4. Researched warfare for attacks and defenses.<br/>5. Came up with army cards that represent units that I thought would be in a steampunk army. These include Archers, Spies, Cavalry, Knights, Paratroopers, Zeppelins,  Cannoneers, Infantry, and Rear Guards.<br/>6. Based attack and defense cards on the research. I ended up with far too many different types of cards, and some of them only work with certain units in certain situations.<br/>7. After I made up the attack and defense and army cards, I determined, by pulling numbers OOMA sort of based on ZR's make-up, the number of each card in the deck.  These total to 57 attack and defense card and 24 army cards for a total of 81 cards.<br/>8. I wrote down some very basic rules that I knew would be changed during the first playtest. Basically, you pick a few army cards, mix the rest in with the deck, and then pick cards out of the deck. Then one player attacks and the other player defends until one army is defeated.<br/><br/>During the first playtesting, lots went wrong, but the game played out in about 40 minutes with all the rule changes. I was shooting for 20 to 30 minutes per hand depending on the number of players.<br/>1. First, I had defeated my opponent's army in the first two turns. So, I changed the number of army cards drawn and we added those to our armies. We also decided to take all the army cards out of the main deck and split them evenly.<br/>2. I didn't come up with discarding rules and because so many of the cards require certain units, lots of cards in a hand needed to be removed before an army could do something. We instituted a rule that allowed two discards per turn.<br/>3. Some of the rules on the cards were so complicated that we forgot to play them right. Whoops.<br/>4. A few of the armies really kicked butt and were too strong.<br/>5. At one point, my army was ENCIRCLED, which means that I could only defend and not attack, but to get out of the trap, I would have had to play a BREAKOUT card. My opponent had one of the two BREAKOUT cards and I had discarded one earlier, so I was toast. Except, my opponent didn't have any cards to play with the left over army units in her army. This went on for three or four rounds of discarding and picking up new cards until finally she found a card to attack with, which allowed me to use a defensive maneuver.<br/>6. Dare I go on...<br/><br/>So, what did I learn:<br/>1. Designing a card game is really hard.<br/>2. In a short card game like I was aiming for, keep the cards simple.<br/>3. Somehow somewhere someone will end up with a terrible hand, so they need an out. You need to design this in.<br/>4. Keep the rules simple, but able to handle all situations.<br/>5. You can complicate rules by adding rules to cards, but don't get too out there.<br/>6. It's a huge challenge to make a card game work right.<br/>7. Playtesting is key.<br/><br/>Even so. This game is turning out to be pretty fun. Even early victories can be upset later in the game, which keeps it challenging. If it turns out to be a good game, I may commission some artwork and do up a few decks for sale and maybe sell pdfs or give pdfs away for free on the web.<br/><br/>And I really encourage the game designers on this board to try designing a card game in the <a href="http://www.cheapass.com/" rel="nofollow">Cheapass Game</a> style.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D" title="Thomas D"><img alt="Thomas D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://landfill.thesnakefarm.com/images/misc/idescols.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D">Thomas D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68841/#Comment_68841" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-13T23:37:04+00:00" title="May 13, 2007 11:37PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I'd like to mention about your post before I head to bed is about your deck size.  When looking at printers that handle cards, I found that the majority of printers use sheets of 55 cards.  Assuming this becomes a real published game, with 81 cards, you're going to be paying for two 55 card sheets, so you might as well use those extra 29 cards for something.  Think about how you can utilize the full 110 card sheet.  It will be the same amount in printing costs as a 81 card deck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryan" title="Bryan"><img alt="Bryan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryan">Bryan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68892/#Comment_68892" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T08:33:53+00:00" title="May 14, 2007  8:33AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Thomas.

The threads he's been involved in have some good information on creating card games, self-publishing, and professionally publishing.  I also found it helpful to contact some smaller game companies about publishing card games -- who to print with and what to expect.  A few years ago, I sent out e-mails to four publishers and heard back from two of them, both with tons of free advice.  Unfortunately, this was in the days before Google Mail, so I have no idea where those messages are now.  <br/><br/>My friend Bo runs a game company called <a href="http://www.shiftingskies.com" rel="nofollow">Shifting Skies</a>.  He's developed one game that involved card printing; future games will also have card components.  <br/><br/>Here's a trick that he used when playtesting an upcoming game release I don't think I can really talk about in detail in an open forum like this, but I can talk about the trick.  For playtesting card mechanics, he printed out the cards on heavyweight paper and used them in card sleeves.  If during playtest cards have to be changed, he can just swap out the printed cards into the sleeves -- the weight and sturdiness of the sleeves makes the actual cards more durable in playtest; the opaque back keeps the playtesters from seeing through the back of cards, so there's no need to print on both sides of your playtest deck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tadk" title="tadk"><img alt="tadk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nAYGI7O6LI2LV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tadk">tadk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69003/#Comment_69003" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T14:22:44+00:00" title="May 14, 2007  2:22PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            hi Bryan<br/>\nI would like to see the rules, stats, cards, etc for this.<br/>\nCurious as to how you determined some of the units, just my curiosity is all<br/>\nI find this interesting, having considered and never gone through with a card game design<br/>\nThanks                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D" title="Thomas D"><img alt="Thomas D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://landfill.thesnakefarm.com/images/misc/idescols.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D">Thomas D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69020/#Comment_69020" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T14:56:11+00:00" title="May 14, 2007  2:56PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, now that I've had some time to go over your post, I'm thinking this:<br/><br/>Start with 110 cards, and split them up between units and maneuvers.  Units would have basic attack and defense abilities.  These can be augmented by playing maneuver cards.  Start up by divvying up a basic troop selection between players.  Each unit has keywords, various maneuvers can be played only on units with that keyword:  Zeppelins and Paratroopers might have Airborne and Anywhere on them, but the Zep would also have the keyword Vehicle while the Paratroopers would have the keyword Troop.  The maneuver Transport Troops would read: "Play on a Vehicle in play to deploy any Troop from your hand to that zone.  That troop gains the keyword Armored."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryan" title="Bryan"><img alt="Bryan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryan">Bryan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69199/#Comment_69199" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T09:25:35+00:00" title="May 15, 2007  9:25AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2007 9:58AM by Bryan.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are some great suggestions, Thomas. It's very similar to what I have already. I hadn't thought of unit keywords, which might help make it easier to recognize which maneuvers go with which units. I like the trick about the card sleeves. I printed my deck out of cardstock, but it's a little light and doesn't shuffle the best. Card sleeves would be a great help.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tadk</cite>I would like to see the rules, stats, cards, etc for this.</blockquote>\nThe rules are very simple, and I don't have them typed up yet, so here goes:<br/><br/>Goal<br/>Destroy all other armies before your army is destroyed.<br/><br/>Set-up<br/>1. Split Army cards between players. 2=12each 3=8each 4=6each<br/>2. Shuffle Action Deck and deal each player 5 action cards.<br/>3. Make 4 or 5 Army cards visible. This is your Front Line. These are the Army cards that can attack and be attacked. The rest are reinforcements. (This rule will be changed.)<br/>4. Place tokens equal to hits on each army card shown.<br/><br/>Play<br/>1. Determine who goes first, rotate clockwise.<br/>2. Negotiations and alliances are allowed if discussed openly in front of everyone.<br/>3. On a turn. A player can.<br/>-a. Discard 2 cards.<br/>-b. Replenish to 5 cards in hand.<br/>-c. Replenish Front Line.<br/>-d. Attack or use Action card in lieu of an attack.<br/>---1. Use attack card with army card to do damage to enemy army card.<br/>---2. If you can't attack with any cards in your hand, you can use three cards to do a standard attack.<br/>-e. Defensive player can play defense card, which may negate attack or reduce damage.<br/>-f. Attacking player damages defensive army.<br/>-g. Defensive player can return fire if his army card is still alive or if the damage caused by the attacking card was equal the armies card hits.<br/>-h. Remove destroyed armies from play.<br/>-i. Defensive player can return long distance fire if attacked by long distance unless attack card says different. This defensive long distance fire can be applied to any unit in the attacker's army.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tadk</cite>Curious as to how you determined some of the units, just my curiosity is all</blockquote>\nI just pulled it out of me a$$. I threw away my brainstorming sheet, but the units have two stats: Hits and Damage. Hits are a unit's health and Damage is the amount of damage it does on an attack. The number of units are based on their strength. The stronger the unit the less there are in the deck and the weaker, the more there are in the deck. I threw everything together in Photoshop, which will have to be redone correctly. <br/><br/>Attached is page three of the cards. It includes some unit cards and attack cards.<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.momentarylapsepress.com/pagethree.jpg"/><br/>The Ambush card isn't all that useful, because most of the time, you're attacking with a card that will completely destroy the defender, but it's been used a couple of times to good effect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryan" title="Bryan"><img alt="Bryan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryan">Bryan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69205/#Comment_69205" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T09:35:21+00:00" title="May 15, 2007  9:35AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's another sheet with a few extra actions on it:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.momentarylapsepress.com/pagesix.jpg"/><br/>The SUICIDE attack is very interesting, but hasn't ever been played.

I personally think the world can use more quick and simple card games.<br/><br/>Our deck is 54 cards because we had six 8.5 x 11 inch sheets with nine cards on each. We had them printed at a small local print company on thicker cardstock, but we've also sold many copies via PDF, so laying them out on Letter size paper was very helpful for that. We suggest that people print out the cards on regular paper, then cut them out and tape them to old Magic cards or whatever, and then sleeve them. Makes a PDF card game very playable.<br/><br/>I'll be checking in on this thread now that I'm a member here, so feel free to ask any questions, and I look forward to you game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tadk" title="tadk"><img alt="tadk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nAYGI7O6LI2LV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tadk">tadk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70313/#Comment_70313" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T15:06:58+00:00" title="May 18, 2007  3:06PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I plan to print these out over the weekend and take a run at the game<br/>\nMakes me want to do my own one too<br/>\n<br/>\nawesome                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryan" title="Bryan"><img alt="Bryan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryan">Bryan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70382/#Comment_70382" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T21:31:44+00:00" title="May 18, 2007  9:31PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I'm feeling a bit of pressure now.<br/><br/>Thanks, Adam. Great game. We've had loads of fun with it and have had people that aren't gamers play it also. I also have a friend in WI, who plays in a Zombie-themed band, who has a copy too. A house rule that we use is to ignore the range. Seems to help prevent one player from getting out so far ahead that s/he is guaranteed a win. I love the form factor of your game and is what I based this one on, although I do see that you arranged the cards with a landscape layout instead of portrait. I'll probably change this one to that after we figure out how to make it work. What weight card stock did you use?<br/><br/>Anyone that hasn't seen the game can find it here: <a href="http://www.snarlingbadger.com/zr1.htm" rel="nofollow">Zombie Rally</a>.<br/><br/>Tad, thanks. It's still pretty rough, so if you do run it, please, improvise on the rules that suck and let me know how you made it unsucky.
