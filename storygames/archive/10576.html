Keith and I have been chatting about playing some one-on-one stuff, and I've been wanting to give the new rules a spin anyway. Last weekend we got together and I made a character, and this weekend we played our first session. CoS, if you haven't had a chance to browse through the website, is set in an obsessively detailed alternate darkages/medieval Europe with a WHOLE LOT going on. It's a big sandbox, so the first step is narrowing down both the style of game (Theme) and identifying where and when the Cell (the group of characters) will be facing off against the GM-generated Conspiracy (which is simply whatever active force is working against the interests of the Cell).<br/><br/>I decided to go big (rather than go home), so we're playing an Apocalypse style game set in the Empire, which is a huge semi-Islamic state that's covers all of North Africa and southeastern Europe, and flavored kind of as if the Ottomans took over a bunch of Poles and then culturally integrated, while maintaining a strict adherence to dogmatic religious law.<br/><br/>Side note - Keith, you should have some kind of "this culture is like THIS, but if THIS happened" in the overviews. Seriously, normal people have a hard time keeping all this shit straight.<br/><br/>Anyway. CoS uses a lifepath system for characters, and since I'm the only member of the Cell I got to take 10 of them. Here's my dude:<br/><br/>Vasili Igorovich, head Muhzar<br/>Age: 37<br/>Drive: The word of the Prophet must be preserved.<br/>Power: Prophet<br/>Lifepaths: The Empire, Brav, Born Gentry, Ogul, Erkek (those are all cultural/ethnic), Odaba, Za'aruba (those are a military progression), Bashani, Polis (those are high-level civilian administrative positions), Muhzar (kind of a Supreme Court Judge with strong religious ties).<br/>Descriptors: History, Law, Patient, Astrology, Swordsman, Literate, Ambitious, Hashish Addict, Brawling, Horseman, Soldiering, Road Weary, Command, Zealous, Beaurocracy, Persuasive, Loyal, Oratory, Observant, Dutiful<br/>Assets:<br/>(Affiliation) - The Amdati Church; I am the most senior Muhzar of the Church.<br/>(Affiliation) - Amdati Military; though inactive, I retain my rank of Za'aruba<br/>(Artifact) - The knucklebones of a Saint; they are inscribed with runes of fortunetelling<br/>(Artifact) - My Badge of Office<br/>(Relationship) - My senior assistant; he is loyal to me unto death; he has no initiative of his own<br/>(Relationship) - The Zar, military advisor to the Kale Kesis; we are good friends from childhood<br/>(Relationship - My brother, the head Sual in the Church; our bond of blood is unbreakable; he will aid me behind the scenes as he sees fit (whether I want him to or not)<br/>(Reputation) Respected in the Church for my wise rulings<br/>(Reputation) Despised by the Slave Soldiers for stripping them of their holdings<br/>(Reputation) Suspected of heresy by a splinter faction in the church (due to my eerily accurate predictions)<br/>(Military Unit) My old unit where I started as an Odaba; Professional Soldiers; Cavalry; Range 2, +2 Morale, Horseman, Lancer, Shortbow, Loyal, Brotherhood, Never Give Up, Battlefield Tactician (Morale 7, Movement 4, Range 2)<br/><br/>So I'm a big deal! My dude is pretty much as far up in the Church hierarchy as he can go without being related to someone (more on that later), and he has a sterling reputation. Except for that whole every so often he engages in some Prophecy, which is technically heresy, but he squares it with his faith by only using it for good purposes and to strengthen the Church and the Empire. So far, at least.<br/><br/>So that's my dude.

I am keen on the copious information not being necessary to play (which is one of the driving forces from not doing a straight up medieval European game). I would rather players see something they dig and make it up as they go along.

We started with the Theme. Here are my notes on it:<br/><br/><b>Theme:</b> Apocalypse<br/><br/><b>Scope:</b> Localized in The Empire. Internal struggle between secular and religious power structures. A second cultural revolution in the works. A struggle between secular forces shattering the social order versus religious domination open the door for outside stressors and the internal third player (slave soldiers) to dominate.<br/><br/><b>Setting:</b> The Kale Kesis has died without a clear successor. Multiple cousins of rank in a position to succeed, including the ruler of the Kesis of Bravich. The people are in morning for the Kale Kesis, but otherwise unaware of the coming storm.<br/><br/><b>Supernatural:</b> Only small supernatural elements crop up. Weird shit. No major players in the Theme.<br/><br/><b>Figures of Note:</b> <br/>Berk Levitan, the Yusek (head of the slave-soldiers)<br/>Ediz the Long Knife, a Sual<br/>The Kesis of Bravich (cousin of the Kale Kesis)<br/>The Kesis of Smertna, Vlad Yaskukoff (Secular cousin of the Kale Kesis)<br/>The Kesis of Zaloza, Iskander Banu-Monomakh (Religious cousin of the Kale Kesis)<br/>The Zar, Semyon Rustavoff<br/>Yulian Igorovich, a Sual (Brother of Vasili)<br/>Kadar, an old tutor of Vasili<br/>Nahir al-Salam, former commander of Vasili<br/>Muta &amp; Fouad, companions from Vasili's old unit<br/>Wa'il Romanovich, former junior officer from Vasili's old regiment<br/>Terek, a friend from Vasili's hometown<br/>Pavel Levitan, Vasili's assistant and nephew of Berk Levitan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235447/#Comment_235447" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-03T20:22:27+00:00" title="October  3, 2009  8:22PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I humbly clamor for more.<br/><br/>Keith, the term -sandbox- is one of those terms that is almost becoming useless.

This is mostly fiction stuff, cuz most of this was establishment and roleplaying, maybe two dice rolls so far? Which was totally great. CoS isn't a high-point-of-contact game, for the record.<br/><br/>We went over my guys background, gave everyone names and nailed down the events leading up the start of play a little more thoroughly. This included me defining my Trigger, which is basically "when we start play, what are you doing." I had interpreted this to be less action-y then intended, but it really wants to be stuff like "I'm running through the sewers pursued by guards" or "I'm in the daughter of the king's bedroom and someone's knocking on the door" stuff. I didn't actually have a very strong idea, but Keith suggested that we start with me in the middle of judging a case that was straightforward until the news arrived of the death of the Kale Kesus, which would change everything. Rad!<br/><br/>Wine and pizza being suitably consumed (classy dudes over here), we got rollin'<br/><br/>Keith starts out by giving the "pre-credit" intro - we have the establishing shots of the Kale Kesus out falconing with his entourage, he gets out ahead of them pursuing his quarry, disappears over a hill - and when they catch up to him, he seems to have managed to have fallen off his horse, his head striking the only rock in the rolling grassland. The Kale Kesus was a young, popular warrior-king, a man who had survived many deadly battles, was immensely popular in the Empire and, obviously, one who would never just be thrown from his own horse. Bam.<br/><br/>Cut to Vasili, in the garden of a local Polis, judging an unusual case. An accusation of witchcraft had been brought against a fairly high-ranking local official by the most infamous Sual (a kind of inquisitor/secret police social role) in the Empire. The whole case was strange - there wasn't really enough evidence presented to convict the man, but this Sual, Ediz "the Long Knife" wasn't known for being wrong. If I judged guilty, the man (who I thought was innocent) would die, but if I judged innocence, the Sual would be pissed off.<br/><br/>And then, while I was deliberating, my assistant brought me the news of the death of the Kale Kesus. Oh snap! Besides the news of a death of a personal friend, this changed the tenor of the case - the accused was the right-hand man of the Kesis of Smertna, who was the more secular candidate for the throne. Judging him guilty would mean the weakening of Smertna's position, while exonerating him would actually strengthen the "secular" claimant against charges of being less than faithful. My character is strongly in the more "religious" faction, but again, the man was innocent. Hard choice!<br/><br/>So, doing what any politician would do when presented with such a situation, I delayed. I made a successful roll to pitch my tactic, which was to say that I still had yet to see the proof of who had been a victim of the accused actions, and the word of the Prophet was very clear that crime was only crime if there was a victim. The word of the Prophet is a big deal in our game so far...<br/><br/>More to come!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21" title="Ken Sentowski!"><img alt="Ken Sentowski!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21">Ken Sentowski!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235600/#Comment_235600" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-05T05:41:07+00:00" title="October  5, 2009  5:41AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 5, 2009 5:43AM by Ken Sentowski!.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>I humbly clamor for more.<br/><br/>Keith, the term -sandbox- is one of those terms that is almost becoming useless.

My definition of a sandbox is a series of tools and materials within a given space, allowing freedom to create within those constraints. So in regards to <em>Conspiracy of Shadows, Dirty Hands</em>, you have a play space (The West) that has its own constraints, and a series of tools you can choose to use in different ways (Themes, Great Game, Powers, Omens, etc.). If you use them in one way you can play Ravenloft, in another Lovercraft, in another The Tudors, or Kingdom of Heaven, and so on.<br/><br/>As for the mono-y-mono action, it was fun, and in some ways you have more to work from as a GM and in other less. You can pull in more of what you want to see more easily with one protagonist, but you have less to respond too at the same time. Luckily, I felt no hinderance to getting into character as we played (I'm a big immersion guy). Good thing this wasn't Nathan and my first date... We are beyond the hand holding stage...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
