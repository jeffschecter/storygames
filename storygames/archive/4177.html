The combat system is already pretty detailed in D20 (and lots of games, really). Modifiers already exist for lots of things a character might try. I don't need to make up modifiers for "I knock his sword out of his grasp", "I trip him", etc. <br/><br/>I could come up with an equivalent set of social modifiers and actions, but really, I figure that most players converse with others enough to understand the basics more than they might understand the ins and outs of hand-to-hand combat. I feel fairly comfortable assigning appropriate modifiers and am not sure that creating a set of equivalently detailed "social combat rules" wouldn't hamper play.<br/><br/>(Spycraft 2.0's seduction dramatic conflict sort of falls into this ballpark. There are pretty explicit rules for actions available and their modifiers, but I honestly feel pretty stilted narrating through them, so I generally reserve it for when I want to abstract the scene away.)<br/><br/>Where I'm guessing you are going with this... well, we'll see if you were laying a trap for me or if you were just curious. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93746/#Comment_93746" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T12:25:28+00:00" title="September  7, 2007 12:25PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also responding to noclue from the other thread:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite><cite>Posted By: Caesar Slaad</cite><br/>I sort of see the players narration as a matter of "announcing intent" and the mechanics reflecting the delivery, to include intangible social aspects such as tone and body language and timing that aren't implicit in the player narrative.</blockquote>\nMy point is there's no theoretical difference between rolling diplomacy skill plus modifiers and a full-on Battle of Wits. You're still using mechanics to resolve conflict. The difference is 1. how much you leave open to GM fiat and 2. How quickly you resolve the conflict and move on to other stuff.<br/><br/><br/>Is this battle of wits in the "burning wheel" context? Sorry, I've only ever read BE, and for that, I don't recall the specifics of a battle of wits, so I may be missing context.<br/><br/>But as much as I can address in context:<br/>1) Yeah, probably. But as I've expressed elsewhere, I am much more comfortable with GM fiat than Luke is, so that's not a big factor for me.<br/><br/>I see randomized mechanics in this case as "arbitrarily deciding things I don't know." If I don't particularly care about the decision of an NPC and have not sketched out how they react to a given situation, I'm probably going to decide that interaction purely on a dice roll.<br/><br/>If the PCs are discussing something with an established NPC I know will react to certain events and interactions in certain ways, my role there is to apply my knowledge of that NPC to the situation, resolving uncertainties with the mechanics.<br/><br/>2) As for duration... such an interplay could actually last a while in my games. There could be several decision points where I roll or call for a roll, with the possibility of much discussion between each such role.<br/><br/>So, in short, it can be about getting the talking part out of the way... or it might not be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93756/#Comment_93756" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T12:45:29+00:00" title="September  7, 2007 12:45PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 7, 2007 12:46PM by Christian_Griffen.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Caesar Slaad</cite>I could come up with an equivalent set of social modifiers and actions, but really, I figure that most players converse with others enough to understand the basics more than they might understand the ins and outs of hand-to-hand combat.</blockquote>\nThis is roleplaying geeks we're talking about -- are you sure? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Joking aside, I disagree.

See, in the DRPG, resolution of _everything_ is handled in basically the way we're talking about social things.  Need to talk your way out of something? Get talking.  Need to fight someone? Start describing what you do.  Sure, stats set the baseline, but clever play ultimately determines the outcome.  Bottom line, you describe and you play, the GM does some hidden math, and things are resolved.  It's fiat - there's a bit of sleight of hand to obscure it, but that's what it is.<br/><br/>This is, to be frank, a lot of fun, but two things get revealed very much over time.<br/><br/>1) Anyone more socially skilled than the GM or who groks how the GM is thinking stylistically is going to dominate play, whatever the rules and<br/>2) Man, it makes the shape of GM fiat crystal clear.<br/><br/>Now, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> is a real problem, but one that people are fully capable of denying.  <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is a bit more of an issue since I don't find it a _problem_ so much as something that slowly wears on me over time.  Sometimes it's awesome, but after a while I want to be able to do more than game the GM.  So I turn to rules.  Combat, research, socializations - whatever it is, when I move to rules it is because I am looking to explicitly address the gaps I find in fiat-driven play, which are primarily in the realm of predictability and fatigue.   I desire predictability in the sense that I like having some sense of the potential results of my action, and I wish to offset fatigue by not having to run every decision through a filter of how the GM is going to interpret it.<br/><br/>Does this thinking distinguish between social rules and other rules?  Well, no. Not really.  And that's not going to be to everyone's taste - some people really want that small piece of fiat mixed in with the rest of their game.  Sometimes it's a patch over a flaw in the rules, sometimes it's a reflection of what the players really wish the system was doing, but most often, it's just how people want to have fun.  This is a hobby with such varied levels of social function that it could be reasonably argued that it's almost impossible to plan for every group, and GM fiat is the ideal form of customization.  The arguments that are going to work at an (to stereotype horribly) Ars Magica table are not the same ones that are going to work at a FATAL table.  If your group consists of polished, socialized players, then a well socialized GM can roll with the punches.  If it consists of mouth breathers, then maybe a bonus for a really good fart joke is exactly what the tense negotiation needs.<br/><br/>The only problem I see, and it's a bit of a catch-22, is that it assumes some uniformity of socialization.  If there is a discrepancy, then the odd man out can get punished in any number of ways.  The shy guy stays clammed up, the sharp guy gets laughed down, the friendly guy gets walked on and so on.  This is, of course, a risk in any social group, but gaming seems to work like a force multiplier for this sort of issue. <br/><br/>On a purely personal level, I don't like this.  Not all my friends are eloquent, some of them are intimidated by the rules or some other element of the game, and as a _group_ we try to make sure they don't get forgotten.  Rules help.  If a player is uncertain and unwilling to give that big speech, but we just give them a big bonus out of sympathy, that is condescending and doesn't solve the problem.  By letting them use the rules, they get bonuses that they have _earned_, which promotes comfort with the system, which in turn leads to confidence in play.<br/><br/>Are these things always issues?  Of course not.  But this is a very important, purely social, issue for me, and to that end, I am happy to have rules for such things.<br/><br/>-Rob D.<br/><br/>PS - And on a less thoughtful level, I like games where people who can talk get to *kick ass*.  I like a civilized world where the guy who can negotiate a deal is at least as valuable as the black belt over there.  This is not a play experience everyone wants, but by god it's exactly what I'm looking for, and a game which allows that makes me very happy indeed. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93771/#Comment_93771" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T13:16:19+00:00" title="September  7, 2007  1:16PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob has my proxy in this here thread.  /Deadwood                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93774/#Comment_93774" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T13:28:32+00:00" title="September  7, 2007  1:28PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From the other thread:<br/><br/>Here's me talking: "I tell him that his eyes are the sweetest shade of blue a mermaid could ever find in the depths of the ocean." CHA, diplomacy, rhetoric, charming, whatever other skill you want. I'm describing something specific that my character does, namely say exactly these words.<br/><br/>Here's me talking: "I grab his arm with both hands as he strikes at me, pushing my body into him, and turn to shove his hand into the glowing ambers of the forge." STR, DEX, attack, maneuver, or whatever other skill you want. I'm describing something specific my character does, namely move in this way.<br/><br/>In NEITHER case is there any reason to believe that my, the player's, input into the fiction does not come out of my creativity, linked to how I see my character, in the very same way. Whether it's a quip of the tongue, a good use of social networks, a cool maneuver, or a dirty little fighting trick, it all comes out of my head and is narrated into the fiction.  My character would have done neither of these things without me making them up. He is capable of a certain amount of tactics as well as charm because of me, the player.<br/><br/>I just don't see why a maneuver of the tongue is somehow supposed to be fundamentally dependent on the player, while a maneuver of the swordarm is fundamentally dependent on the character. It makes absolutely no sense to me. The only reason this divide exists is that it's a historical artifact: RPGs grew out of wargames, which modeled combat and didn't have any rules for anything else. And they didn't need to, because it was all about fighting monsters and taking their stuff. But there is no logical reason why this divide should be upheld as we come to expand the range of actions within the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93790/#Comment_93790" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T13:59:11+00:00" title="September  7, 2007  1:59PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice, thoughtful post Rob.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rob Donoghue</cite><br/>This is, to be frank, a lot of fun, but two things get revealed very much over time.<br/><br/>1) Anyone more socially skilled than the GM or who groks how the GM is thinking stylistically is going to dominate play, whatever the rules and<br/>2) Man, it makes the shape of GM fiat crystal clear.<br/></blockquote>\nOh, the irony.<br/><br/>Back in the day, I remember having a debate with John Wick about the role of rules and his answer to my objections and concerns at the time was "you just have to trust..."<br/><br/>Now it appears I am on the other side of the table. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I see rules as an important part of the social contract of the game.

I'll apply situation modifiers, but in the end, in this sort of game, I'll call for a roll and the character's skill will apply.<br/><br/>For that matter, I don't see combat as purely as matter of the character either. A player can make smart or stupid/brave choices in combat as well. A character who decides to, oh, wrestle the great dragon unarmed is not going to fare any better than if he tells the sultan to piss up a rope.\n<blockquote> It makes absolutely no sense to me. The only reason this divide exists is that it's a historical artifact: RPGs grew out of wargames, which modeled combat and didn't have any rules for anything else. And they didn't need to, because it was all about fighting monsters and taking their stuff. But there is no logical reason why this divide should be upheld as we come to expand the range of actions within the fiction.</blockquote>\nI think we are going to have to agree to disagree on this point. There is a logical reason: because they are different activities. To some extent, your methodologies can be merged, but there comes a point, IMO, where you are starting to pound a square peg into a round whole. Having a single unifying method is satisfying and convenient, but it can also be poor or insufficient modeling, depending on what you are after. <br/><br/>Not that they can't work passably, but it misses some things, depending on the depth I am interested in modeling. As I mentioned earlier, Spycraft uses the dramatic conflict system for seduction, which is the same system for hacking and car chases. What it will do is give me a basic model of events and their resolution. But it glosses over some possibilities and nuances of such an interaction as role-played sans rules, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93826/#Comment_93826" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T14:53:52+00:00" title="September  7, 2007  2:53PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I meant to emphasize: it makes no sense *to me*. So I'm not trying to persuade you or anything, just to show where I'm at.<br/><br/>You're talking about differences in activities. I'm talking about the way input into the fiction works in roleplaying games.<br/><br/>We're on the topic of conflicts here. Two characters in the fiction want different things. Otherwise, we wouldn't need these mechanics at all. After all, if our characters are just chatting (social), we don't roll anything. If we're walking along (physical), we don't roll anything. But if I try to slip a lie past you (social), we have a conflict. And if I try to slip a knife between your ribs (physical), we have a conflict.<br/><br/>So far, so good, right?<br/><br/>The question here is not, for now, one about unified systems, or how detailed our "model" of the activity is. Let's assume we can have a variety of detail, from one roll to dozens of maneuvers, and that we can have the same or completely different systems for social and physical conflicts.<br/><br/>The question for me is why in one conflict the player's skills should matter more and in another they should matter less. Why is one modeled more based on the character's scores and the other on the player's ability to persuade the GM?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93839/#Comment_93839" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T15:10:34+00:00" title="September  7, 2007  3:10PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenopulse</cite>I meant to emphasize: it makes no sense *to me*.

Someone will always get the shaft there, because no GM can be objective about that, period. That has nothing to do with what I'm about to type, but may distantly explain where some of it comes from.<br/><br/>1.) The mere presence of social mechanics in a game doesn't obligate anyone to engage them every time two or more characters are having a disagreement. There are good times and bad times to use them.<br/><br/>2.) The mere presence of social mechanics in a game doesn't obligate a player to put elements of his character "up for grabs" to change as a result of a social conflict unless it would be cool or make sense, or whatever criteria you want to insert. It *does*, however, obligate you to be clear about what's precisely at stake.<br/><br/>These two things render most any example anyone could come up with to defend either side of the "pure roleplay vs. social mechanics" debate useless, because they reveal that the dichotomy is pretty much false. You can just narrate social stuff as much as you want, and you can turn to the dice where there's an impasse and both parties are open to a mechanical resolution for the result.<br/><br/>In other words, if you're afraid that a social conflict failure will ruin your character for you, and that's even possible in the group you're playing with, your group is doing it wrong. If you're having a good time talking stuff out, and you use the dice because you feel obligated and it trips up your scene, your group is doing it wrong.<br/><br/>Let's take a really basic example. Bob has high social skills stat-wise, and he's trying to convince John, who has recently been disgraced at court, to leave the Princess Shelly's harvest day ball because he's making Bob and himself look bad. John retorts that as his friend, Bob should join him in protesting the silly mandates of the court. The players start talking, and it becomes clear to everyone else sitting there that after five minutes of the players arguing in character, no one's going to convince anyone of the other's position.<br/><br/>Now what? First, you have to find out if either player is even interested in letting their character be changed here - if not, it's dysfunctional to engage the social mechanics at this point to resolve the dispute. If they are willing, awesome - go to the dice and settle the matter once and for all. <br/><br/>But, so I can finish this post, suppose neither of them is open to the possibility of change - John's got a chip on his shoulder he's interested in exploring, and Bob doesn't want the baggage of going against the court. You have two options at this point:<br/><br/>1.) Call it a stalemate. Neither side gets what they want from the other, but neither has to worry about their character changing, either. Suggest that Bob will have to change tactics if he wants John gone, like get him arrested or something.<br/><br/>2.) Find something relevant to the conflict that you *can* resolve with mechanics, as a guide to how you break the deadlock, showcase Bob's high Persuasion skill, and allow the scene to proceed.<br/><br/>How do you do <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>? By using the magic wisdom of Rob Donoghue, who once said to me, "More often than not, social conflict should revolve around a question of sincerity, rather than a question of influence. It's much more palatable to suggest a social roll to cement that a character perceives something as sincere and true, instead of dictating a course of action for that character."<br/><br/>Back to our example. Bob's player goes, "Okay, clearly my dude's not going to talk John into leaving, but can I convince him beyond the shadow of a doubt that if he does this, he's taking my reputation down with his?" John's player says, "Sure - if you can get past my awesome Willpower skill, we'll say John totally believes that." Now this scene is infinitely more interesting, because John is still free to do whatever. He could totally acknowledge that he has to harm his friend to get what he wants... and do it anyway, and that's way more dramatic than it was before.<br/><br/>Now, a small challenge: I assert that the last paragraph inserts way more meaning and power into the scene because it's backed by mechanics, than it would be if Bob had simply said the same fact as part of his verbal retorts to John. Because the mechanics say, "This statement is true in the fiction," whereas with just the verbal, John can claim that his character just didn't buy it at the time or whatever, and try to weasel out of all the drama in that choice with nothing to dispute him.<br/><br/>Consider also that you can shortcut everything I just said by focusing purely on questions of sincerity as the motivation for using social mechanics. Don't couch it as, "Does the hot catgirl seduce my character," couch it as, "Does my character genuinely believe the hot catgirl is attracted to him for reasons that aren't purely selfish?" It's still a seduction, either way, except in the second case, it doesn't necessarily have to end with, "My character sleeps with the hot catgirl."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93903/#Comment_93903" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T18:27:18+00:00" title="September  7, 2007  6:27PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Landon,<br/><br/>Just a few things that I might clarify that might address any lingering curiosity (or might not).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Landon Darkwood</cite>First of all, as a preface, I'm pretty much against any game bonus that<i>arbitrarily</i>rewards people for elaborate talking, emphasis important. Someone will always get the shaft there, because no GM can be objective about that, period.</blockquote>\nI think perhaps a little more insight into how I do things here may be warranted. Though it's not codified, it's really not so arbitrary. When I judge how an NPC reacts, I consider their motivations and relations. Take, for example: (to steal from Firefly) imagine the players need the assistance of a local noble. I decide in advance that simple sweet talk or bribery are not likely to be effective, but a show of determination or conviction can bolster his faith that the characters are worthy of his trust. I set the difficulty accordingly depending on how the PCs approach him. That is the main mechanism by which my "set difficulty/modifiers by results of roleplay" happen.<br/><br/>Now I will state that if players do something cool or clever that I didn't consider and/or bring a smile to my face... yeah, I'm going to reward that. If that's arbitrary... oh well. It makes the game more enjoyable and that's why we play in the first place. Flowery speech, however, rarely gets it done for me.\n<blockquote><br/>These two things render most any example anyone could come up with to defend either side of the "pure roleplay vs. social mechanics" debate useless, because they reveal that the dichotomy is pretty much false.

Use the rules to resolve uncertainties. (I dub this "roll dice or yammer" <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> )\n<blockquote><br/>In other words, if you're afraid that a social conflict failure will ruin your character for you, and that's even possible in the group you're playing with, your group is doing it wrong.

As I mention back in the thread that inspired this one, one of the reasons that I liked SotC when I saw it was that the aspect mechanic strongly resembled my own mechanic that I was cooking up to address my concerns about player-PC control in the face of compulsion style mechanics. I feel the aspect mechanic is a fair way to address this. If they player doesn't want to take the compel, then they forego the fate point. Fair enough. <br/><br/>But in a game without it, I usually take the Spycraft approach when it comes to the use of social skills in such a situation: I describe what a normal response would be, but it's ultimately up to the player how to react.

I can't say that it's always my stance all the time, but basically I like the idea that a lowly Samurai goes to his Lord, and after some gritty and lucky rolls he's able to convince the lord to quit and run away.<br/><br/>Impossible, purely impossible from a "realistic" and "roleplaying" point of view. There is no fucking way the lowest rung on the totem pole is going to move the highest even through a good roleplaying debate: The GM simply shouldn't allow it, it's too "out there". You might as well describe how you want to try to survive falling out of an airplane and landing in a field of poison-covered metal spikes. Or fight a terrasque with a dagger. DENIED. <br/><br/>And yet, a game where the idea is that you can at least try to take down anything with social mechanics... that puts a level of randomness in there which may seem goofy, but can be cool.  OK, so the low samurai gets tons of penalties, and the lord gets tons of bonuses: But if it's possible, and the player rolls it, crazy stuff happens.  If you're a GM that's cool with that, some interesting things can occur.<br/><br/>The GM looks at the dice roll where the lord fails. Takes a second to put the pieces together, to decide WHY the lord was beaten.<br/><br/>Maybe someone from a neighboring kingdom is after this land and the lord's life, and he was thinking of booking it anyway; and now he's got a real excuse to do so, and a lowly samurai to be the fall guy when the assassin ninjas come.<br/><br/>Perhaps the lord is dying, and knows it?<br/><br/>Perhaps the lord realizes that the lowly samurai has the people's support, comes to the conclusion that his own leadership was mistaken, and decides to join a monestary?<br/><br/>Each of the above breaks the scenario's status quo, and shakes it up. And each could take the play in a new, cool direction it couldn't have gone if the GM just said, "Hah, forget about it. Talk all you want, it simply *can't happen*".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93914/#Comment_93914" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T19:33:12+00:00" title="September  7, 2007  7:33PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Now I will state that if players do something cool or clever that I didn't consider and/or bring a smile to my face... yeah, I'm going to reward that.

More power to you. My distaste has more to do with that as a general technique, because I've seen it punish less-talky or just less-jiving-with-the-GM players and create passive-aggressive "please the GM" competitiveness so many times that I've lost count.<br/><br/>The only instance of it that hasn't bothered me is in Primetime Adventures, with Fan Mail. Why? Two reasons. First, because anyone can award anyone for doing the "cool" stuff, whatever that means, and it doesn't just get filtered through the GM's biases. Second, because the influence of Fan Mail on conflicts isn't targeted to social or physical or whatever type of conflict - once you have it, you can spend it anywhere you want. So, less talky player can get Fan Mail for different reasons than his talking skills, and spend it wherever. It works out to be way more egalitarian, especially among strangers, than any other approach I've seen, with no costs in awesome.\n<blockquote>You do understand from what I've said upthread that this is not the <i>debate</i> with me, it's the <i>method</i>. Use the rules to resolve uncertainties. (I dub this "roll dice or yammer" <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> )</blockquote>\nTotally, yes, I do. I was speaking to the assembled in the thread and all potential readers, not trying to single you out. My bad if that didn't come across.<br/><br/>I think where we <i>might</i> differ is that I think it's essential to have an out for the non-talky player where he or she can just go, as an acceptable move, "Look, my dude's a con artist. I convince you, and this number right here says I've got a pretty good chance at doing so. Because this number is so high, my dude would know what the best tactic to get to you is, and use it, and that's what my roll is for." And that to a degree, the group is obligated to respect that move and not dismiss it out of hand just because he or she skipped the roleplaying part. If they want to dismiss it because of the other person's character integrity, or whatever, that's another issue.<br/><br/>And further, if that dude calls for dice straight away and you respect that call, bonuses for roleplaying are right off the table, regardless of how cool the other player's reply is. <br/><br/>In other words, there can be dangers in the synthesis too, depending on how you synthesize. This is not a call for you to defend your choices, so you know - just throwing more grist out there for the mill.<br/><br/>Finally, a side comment: we've been talking about roleplaying vs. going to dice primarily in terms of non-talky vs. strong-talky players, but the fact is, sometimes the most boring thing to do at a game is listen to other people roleplay, even when they're good at it. Not really part of what we're talking about, but related.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93918/#Comment_93918" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T20:04:32+00:00" title="September  7, 2007  8:04PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>The other thing that no one says is that it is fun.</blockquote> I  was trying to get caught up on the threads and was thinking to myself.

Thanks Landon, for pointing it out to me.  This is exactly the kind of consideration I take with my table, and I'm hoping to encourage others with in my podcast.<br/><br/>I'm really boiling Landon's threads down here, so if something is lost in the translation, throw it out there.  Here's the jist of what I'm getting.<br/><br/><b>1.  Social mechanics doesn't necessarily change the character, but does affect they're perception of others in game.</b><br/><br/>I remain skeptical that everyone sees it that way, but that certainly is far more palatable from an RP stand point.  It does, however, still make me question the need for mechanics in light of the pieces I see being lost from not using them.<br/><br/><b>2.  Not everyone at the table RP's equally, and those of lesser skill get lost in the shuffle.</b><br/><br/>I wish I could say this didn't happen.  It does.  Unfortunately, what you have at this point, is a player problem.  A change of rules may limit their damage, but it doesn't really fix the problem.<br/><br/>I say it's a player problem, because even when the character's are adversaries, the players are a team.  Or should be.  Everyone is trying to get the game to be fun for everyone else.  Even if you change the rules, someone still being selfish with the fun.  They're not being considerate of others, and some involvement out of character/game may be needed to solve the issue.<br/><br/>It's also important that a GM/DM/ETC consider the level of the player, not just the character, when making rulings.  And this is another one of the finesse touches, I think a faceless mechanic might actually hurt a new player with.  I'm going to have to kick the tires personally, but I hope you can at least understand why a flag went up for me.  When things are under GM control, they can give in a little to the new players, and help teach them the ropes.  When it's a mechanic, the player can just as easily get lost in the machine, not knowing to ask for a roll, use a skill, etc.  Basically, not everyone RP's at the same level, but not everyone runs the rules at the same level either.  You're trading one for the other.<br/><br/>These are all things I hope to teach in my podcast.  Once we do our section on alignment, this is going to be a big push by us.  Being a better 'player' and helping people out, regardless of play style.  Remember that you aren't having fun alone, and you can't play the game by yourself, so make sure other people want to keep asking you back.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96418/#Comment_96418" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T19:58:50+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  7:58PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris you forgot the part about them being <big>Awesome</big>!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kent" title="Kent"><img alt="Kent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kent">Kent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96488/#Comment_96488" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T07:15:00+00:00" title="September 16, 2007  7:15AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><br/>The GM looks at the dice roll where the lord fails.

People at the table will have hard feelings if the role-players are getting a better deal, because the rules say they should get the same shake.  If you give those who stick to the rules a better shake, then role-players will question why to do it at all, and eventually, just rely on the rules.<br/><br/>So, people end up drifting one way or the other anyway.  Every situation can only be resolved 1 way (not to say there is only one answer, but once you've resolved it you don't get to go back).  And one way is going to net the game more/or less.  Ultimately, that's a personal preference, but still one worth exploring.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97171/#Comment_97171" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T10:22:48+00:00" title="September 18, 2007 10:22AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grimm</cite>So, people end up drifting one way or the other anyway.</blockquote>\nYour saying people at the table will decide how their group will resolve things?

Obviously, the group will decide how to resolve things -- by their choice of rules and/or their choices in play.  However, I don't think that having mechanics but selectively applying them is inherently the best of both worlds.  As Landon said earlier:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Landon Darkwood</cite>1.) The mere presence of social mechanics in a game doesn't obligate anyone to engage them every time two or more characters are having a disagreement. There are good times and bad times to use them.<br/><br/>2.) The mere presence of social mechanics in a game doesn't obligate a player to put elements of his character "up for grabs" to change as a result of a social conflict unless it would be cool or make sense, or whatever criteria you want to insert. It *does*, however, obligate you to be clear about what's precisely at stake.<br/><br/>These two things render most any example anyone could come up with to defend either side of the "pure roleplay vs. social mechanics" debate useless, because they reveal that the dichotomy is pretty much false. You can just narrate social stuff as much as you want, and you can turn to the dice where there's an impasse and both parties are open to a mechanical resolution for the result.</blockquote>\nSure, you can add more options in play.  However, this seems parallel to "feature creep" in product design -- i.e. the idea that if you add in more options, then it's better for the user because they can use what they like the most.  Really, though, having to sift through options in play can be a burden.  <br/><br/>I'm OK with a variety of takes on social mechanics -- but I don't think there is any objective sweet spot of too mechanical versus too freeform.

I guess I'm just of the opinion that I play with a group if I enjoy what's going on at the table. If I don't enjoy what they're into, I take my toys somewheres else.\n<blockquote>And along the jhkim's point.

So, I can't buy into a keep options minimal credo if it means I don't get to do stuff that I've tried and liked. I'm not saying its needed. I'm saying I have enjoyed using the mechanics greatly and my fun would be diminished without their existence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grimm" title="Grimm"><img alt="Grimm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grimm">Grimm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97564/#Comment_97564" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-19T12:50:35+00:00" title="September 19, 2007 12:50PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So, I can't buy into a keep options minimal credo if it means I don't get to do stuff that I've tried and liked.

Spirit of the Century does two really cool things in my view. First, Aspects. They really enable you to tell a pulp action story. The fact that you can place temporary aspects on another character as an attack (e.g. blinded by sand in your eyes) and then others can use those aspects to get bennies, lends itself to the genre. The mechanics surrounding the use of aspects, including temporary aspects and compels, are fun in and of themselves. The other thing it does is use the compel mechanic as a way to share narrative control with the players. Being able to spend a fate point to make a declaration about the world is also fun. Without those mechanics, you could do those things, but to replicate the feel you'd basically be building other mechanics into your house rules to do them.<br/><br/>Other games do other cool things: Burning Wheel does social combat very well. The give and take of a dual of wits is nothing like diplomacy roles in D&amp;D for instance. You could build a mechanic around diplomacy roles to handle it, I guess. With exchanges and some kind of counter to track who's winning the debate, but then you'd just be engaged in building replacement mechanics again. So, since the mechanics themselves are fun, and duplicating the experience means building replacement mechanics, I'd just as soon use the ones that are there.<br/><br/>RPing things out is another way to go of course, but it might replicate the result "character x wins the debate!" Frex. It wouldn't replicate the same experience I have had using these tools.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SeleneTan" title="SeleneTan"><img alt="SeleneTan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/264/nRW74G3J2K4XC.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SeleneTan">SeleneTan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97698/#Comment_97698" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T00:05:02+00:00" title="September 20, 2007 12:05AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grimm</cite>Here's the point in the conversation where I always scratch my head, and what always brings me around to the same question.

But having a situation covered in the rules reminds people that it exists and can be part of play, if they want it to be. If you ripped out the combat rules from D&amp;D, there'd be a lot less combat in play, and it would probably be less detailed when it came up.<br/><br/>Rules are what shape the experience of play. If there are no written rules, then play will tend to slip into whatever feels most comfortable and safe for the players. It might also be the case that players don't know how to get the experience they want without rules detailing the procedure. Rules can also help guide creativity into more satisfying channels and put everyone one the same page, e.g. world creation in Shock: Social Science Fiction. <br/><br/>Rules play a part similar to the role of, say, the character creator in The Sims. I, personally, don't have the skill to draw or model the characters I want to play. But the character creator provides rules (e.g., limits for nose size, limits on how far up or down the eyes can be on the face) and materials (the basic face model, hair and clothing) that allow me to create characters I would not otherwise be able to on my own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
