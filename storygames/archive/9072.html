This is the first Game Chef competition I actually completed, and with a game that's actually fun, to boot. What a great experience. Thank you for running this.<br/><br/>I wanted to try and respond without sounding defensive, if that's possible. I think a lot of their criticisms, even the ones I disagree with, are understandable and valid. But the game isn't very long, so most of the things that are in there were put there on purpose after alternatives had been considered.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason</cite> The whole terrorist angle seems puerile and pasted on.<br/></blockquote>\nThe "terrorist angle" evolved as the solution to a design problem. I needed to give the players a motivation to get out and have the best day possible, getting to know their city. Why would you do that? <em>Because the city is going to be gone tomorrow</em>, I thought. But how do the players know that? <em>Because they're the ones who will destroy it</em>. But having the players roleplay the destruction of the city took away from the feel-good vibe I wanted the game to have. That's how I came up with the idea to have the city's destruction already set to occur, and impossible to stop. The idea of players as foreign agents who had come to love their adopted home resonated with <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2211996" rel="nofollow">one of the theories</a> in a series of articles Timothy Noah wrote for Slate in February about why America hasn't been attacked by terrorists again since 9/11. Really, the player's aren't terrorists. They're former terrorists who realize they've made a mistake they're powerless to correct. Themes of doomed love for something, of having made a terrible mistake, of making an ultimately meaningless gesture in an attempt to make peace with yourself seemed ripe for a modern storygame. I didn't all of that because I couldn't think how to do so in a mechanically meaningful way and still fit the thing on a single piece of paper.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason</cite> It barely uses the ingredients.<br/></blockquote>\n"Burn" represented the destruction of the city, which is the central motivation for the entire game. It's the reason I went with firebombs instead of nukes.<br/><br/>"Midnight" was used as the default time to start the storytelling portion of the game. Recognition that this was silly and arbitrary was the entire reason I included variant rules for doing the storytelling at other hours. I was also trying to subtly reinforce that <em>yes</em> I the default rules really do want you to meet at midnight. Really though, it represents the idea that the game takes a "day" to play, starting the moment you wake up, and finishing at the "end" of the day with the storytelling.<br/><br/>"Sea" was pasted on. I misread the contest rules and thought I only needed to use 2 of the 4 words. The reason I uploaded 2 versions of the game was because I decided to add a 3rd word. I figured better a game that met the requirements on a technicality than one that could simply be disqualified. I took the "sea" references out of the version of the game I printed.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason</cite> The gamey parts don't add anything to the experience.<br/></blockquote>\nI think the only "gamey part" is the You Cannot Read rule, which is there to vastly open up the freedom of players to pursue invented narratives (especially in the variations where you pretend to play in a different city, or a fantasy locale). The rule adds nothing to the experience if everybody chooses to tell the truth, which is encouraged for inexperienced players.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason</cite> It's immersive by fiat or it isn't immersive at all, I can't tell.<br/></blockquote>\nI think the game is immersive. The game asks you to go out into the city and try to experience its essence, or <em>immerse</em> yourself in it (a word I decided to use explicitly in the "Goal of the Game" section after some internal debate as to whether it was more crass or sincere). I think the game has the potential to be story-game-theory-style immersive as well, because the of the storytelling competition that occurs at the end of the day. In my experience good storytellers breathe life into stories, even exaggerated or wholly fictional ones. The game invites players to have experiences worth talking about passionately, and to share those experiences in as entertaining and captivating manner as they are able. When I think about immersion, that's what it means to me.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite> you wouldn't really pretend to be your agent all day, would you?<br/></blockquote>\nI was of the mind that the act of pretending would take away from the immersion. You <em>are</em> the agent, whether you think of yourself that way or not. If you have agreed to play the game, then that's just how it is. You're immersed in the role of the agent, and the character of the agent is immersed in you. At least, that's the sort of immersion I was going for.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite> I'd want to go to a restaurant. And I'd want to talk about my day, but without thinking that someone might be lying to me.<br/></blockquote>\nIn my mind, that's a perfectly acceptable way to play the game. Encouraged, even.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200599/#Comment_200599" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-04T10:28:01+00:00" title="April  4, 2009 10:28AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero</cite> why would I play this game instead of doing the thing itself for its own sake? ... Don't you encounter interesting people and strange little stories during your day without having to lie about it?<br/></blockquote>\nFor the same reason that guys will get together to play penny-ante poker as an excuse to sit around and talk. Why don't they just all go over to somebody's house and talk? The game was designed to provide an excuse to consciously pursue experiences that are worth talking about later. Sure, there are rules for lying, but those more for experienced players, which is why the rules encourage new players to stick to the truth as much as possible.<br/><br/>The game is predicated on the idea that, while there's nothing stopping people from doing any of this stuff, we do not pursue it of our own volition often enough. Why is that? I know that I'm liable to spend my weekends running errands, watching tv or reading the internet more often than not. The game is a flimsy excuse to break your routine and pursue experiences worth talking about afterwards. It's so sincere in its "get out there and have fun" spirit that it's almost a little embarrassing.<br/><br/>I mean, there's nothing to stop anyone from designing short games every weekend, but it takes something like a Game Chef to get me to do it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200602/#Comment_200602" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-04T10:30:24+00:00" title="April  4, 2009 10:30AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<strong>Designer's Commentary</strong><br/><br/>I wrote The City Burns At Midnight. The entire thing, from first having the idea to designing the cover to doing layout took about 14 hours. I uploaded it before I went to bed. For this, I have only the page limit challenge to thank, because it gave me an excuse to keep the game short. Many things in the game are ideas that I've been mulling over for years, finally put into something (my first Game Chef attempt resulted in a page of notes for a game about photographers in a war-torn city). Beyond my own design obsessions, the game is informed by the game Baron Munchausen (which I have neither read nor played, so more like the <em>idea</em> of Baron Munchausen), the ARG-ish <a href="http://www.sfzero.org" rel="nofollow">sfzero</a>, the "ethical game design" <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=16392" rel="nofollow">rant</a> given by <a href="http://number-none.com/blow/" rel="nofollow">Jonathan Blow</a> (Braid) at the 2007 Montreal Games Summit, and recent talks by <a href="http://www.avantgame.com/" rel="nofollow">Jane McGonigal</a> (ilovebees, Find the Lost Ring, World Without Oil) about "how games can save the world."<br/><br/>I'm a video game designer by trade. I make mostly action games about shooting monsters/people (the most recent game I worked on was EA's "Dead Space" as a level designer). I was laid off in January, and will be starting at a new company in mid-April. I wanted to use the Little Game Chef competition as an excuse to do something as different from my usual games as possible.<br/><br/>The City Burns At Midnight wants only one thing: for you to live a life worth talking about. It exists to give you an excuse to consciously approach your life and the world around you with this intention, and to share your experiences with your friends. Anything else in the game simply lies on top of that core experience like layers of onion skin. I knew the format restriction would limit the number of rules I could have, so my qualifying question for any rule I considered was "can this rule get in the way of letting you have the best day possible?" Rules that got in the way were cut.<br/><br/>For example, I considered giving the agents a second goal besides capturing a memory of the city. The agents would identify target locations for firebombs, with the added possibility that the agents work to prevent the sabotage and save the city. I liked this because it stepped up the roleplaying aspect, and it had the potential to give players an initial destination as they looked for a good story. I cut it because I didn't like the idea of forcing an obligation onto the player, and because I wasn't sure I could fit adequate rules &amp; motivation for saving/dooming the city onto a single page along with everything else. Not to mention, I'm not sure if I wanted a "game" where people take to the streets to identify and photograph good targets for terrorist attacks. This is to say nothing of my idea to have players carry a "bomb" object (say a notebook or a garden gnome) that they would place and photograph in these locations.<br/><br/>There's really only one rule in The City Burns At Midnight, and that's the "You Cannot Read" rule. That's what makes TCBAM a game in my eyes, and not just a suggestion to live life like it matters. I liked this rule because it creates options, not obligations. It lets players get gonzo and build really weird stories that other players know are lies but still feel plausible, but it only comes into play during the storytelling phase. Players who want to pursue a narrative have more freedom to do so, while those who stick to the facts can essentially ignore the rule entirely. This game is intended to be played multiple times, and this is a rule that rewards players who become comfortable with the game's format and start to attain mastery of the proof-gathering and narrative-construction elements.<br/><br/>I mentioned earlier the metaphor of rules beyond "have an awesome day" sitting on top of this core concept like layers of onion skin. This is based on a theory from videogame design called the gameplay onion. Gameplay in videogames can be thought of in layers, arranged by length of time required by that aspect of the game. The core is usually thought of as "second-to-second" gameplay: things like basic movement, jumping, shooting, selecting objects; the atomic controls given to the player. Wrapped around this are more complex layers that reflect gameplay in ever-larger time chunks. Higher levels of the onion might include "Combat," "Level Design," "Gameflow," "Achievements," etc. Improving lower levels of the gameplay onion improves the enjoyability of higher levels. That is, if it's fun to simply move your character around, then all levels in the game become more fun, but terrible controls mean that even well-designed levels will seem frustrating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200603/#Comment_200603" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-04T10:30:39+00:00" title="April  4, 2009 10:30AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm trying to decide where to take TCBAM from here. Following the gameplay onion concept, I want to present the game as a series of concentric "rings" of play, each one building on and informed by previous rings. In this way, new players can easily start with a stripped-down, but fundamentally identical version of the game. From there, groups can choose to take on new layers as experience, inclination, and whim dictate. The core is essentially the "For Reals" variation, where players go into the city looking to have incredible experiences, and come back to share them. This is less a game than an activity, but still fundamentally expresses TCBAM's design goal. The next chapter adds the rules for lying, and more or less results in the version of the game from Little Game Chef. Subsequent chapters add more layers of mechanics to push the game in a more rpg-ish direction (perhaps taking the idea of the "fantastic" variation with a codified fictional city setting?). A group of players can decide together how gamey they want their experience before setting out. In this way, TCBAM could potentially be a way for storygamers to gradually introduce non-gamers to the idea of story games.<br/><br/>Thus it is ironic that one worry I have is that this game may not be easy to demo quickly, especially at gaming conventions, given that it requires a full day to play. Indeed, the sort of behavior encouraged by the game (exploring a city) might not mesh well with what gamers want to do at cons (stay inside and sit at a table).<br/><br/>Ideally, I would like to maintain a 1-page version of the game similar to the Little Game Chef entry that I can print off cheaply and give away for free. I made a slightly modified playtest version with my name and contact info on it, and printed up a run of 100 at Kinkos for less than $30 (would have been even cheaper, but I had them fold it for me). I gave copies away to friends and strangers at the Game Developer's Conference in San Francisco, which was the same week as Little Game Chef. There are a few leftovers currently scattered around on zine racks throughout the city.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dyson%20Logos" title="Dyson Logos"><img alt="Dyson Logos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dyson%20Logos">Dyson Logos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200612/#Comment_200612" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-04T11:13:53+00:00" title="April  4, 2009 11:13AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of the entries I read (about half of them so far) it's the one I felt was immediately worth telling my girlfriend (a non-RPG-gamer) about. It's weakest point was the sea ingredient, and from a contest perspective that was damning in itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that it acts as an excuse to do something you should be doing anyways, but amongst gamers that's a good thing. For some gamers, it could easily be the first time they tried to do something like that. Further, I would love to make the game more "challenging" for a group that would enjoy it anyways, by running it on a day with horrible weather (I'm looking at you, February in Ottawa) - I think it would be very interesting on a day when the whole city is shut down from a massive snowstorm.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it's AWESOME that you passed around copies at the conference, total win behaviour. If it's worth writing, it's worth publishing. I know that Jason has been handing out copies of Redemption Night at the University of Ottawa Games Club, and I *think* he posted it on the board at the local RPG shop.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that the game lacks a way to push the immersion angle since the players are likely out on their own and CAN be immersed in it, or can just have a day and then work hard on making up lies about it that evening right before the meeting. With the right players it can be absolutely immersive and awesome, but like Baron Munchausen, it really takes players who can tell tales and who "get it".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dyson%20Logos" title="Dyson Logos"><img alt="Dyson Logos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dyson%20Logos">Dyson Logos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200613/#Comment_200613" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-04T11:15:11+00:00" title="April  4, 2009 11:15AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and I would TOTALLY play it as a convention game.

For what it's worth, I'm not convinced that there are any legal means to <em>force</em> a person to be immersed in an experience. That's more a feeling than a proven position, though, and this game was sort of an exercise in getting as close to guaranteed immersion-as-I-understand-it as I could. But even if you disagree with my thoughts, understand that belief still informed my design decisions here. I'd be sincerely (and professionally) interested in any proof to the contrary, though.<br><br>It was important to me that players who don't "get" story games could have fun making a story with this game.
