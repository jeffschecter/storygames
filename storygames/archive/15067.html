I think that approach is going to be limiting and kind of arbitrary, being based on the perception of whoever comes up with categories.  But you do get to have all the fun arguing about which is the best category and where a particular game falls in the schema I suppose...<br/><br/>Anyway, one essential commonality for all games, RPGs included, is the players must be <b>making meaningful decisions</b>.  By meaningful I mean simply that if/when the player makes a decision,  it matters to the game.  Take a slot machine - you pull the handle, stuff happens, you might win or lose.  Rinse and repeat.  It doesnt matter when or how you pull the handle - it has no bearing on the outcome.  Whereas playing an automated poker game - you get to decide to hold or fold cards, bet big or small, etc...  You are  given choices, and your decisions matter. <br/><br/>I think in most cases where I have emphatically not enjoyed a game is when my participation amounts to basically just 'pulling the handle' when required.  <br/><br/>Id like to see if we can make a list of the various types of meaningful decisions players can make in RPGs, Ill start:<br/><br/><b>Character design choices concering effectiveness</b>.  In tactical RPGs you are given a list of design constraints and your initial task is to design a character that will be effective in the context of the party and the challenges the party will face.  You have to consider various tradeoffs, allocate design resources -- in order to create the character that will best fit the role you want to play and strategies you want to employ.   This is where I think min-maxing gets a bad rap.  min-maxing is just a design choice.  Its just as valid as creating a jack-of-all trades character for instance.  If it results in a broken game, its the design constraints that are to blame, not the player for finding the flaw.<br/><br/><b>strategy and tactics</b>: These decisions are a natural extention of character design decisions.  Having designed your character, you now employ its capabilities to try to maximise its effectiveness in overcoming challenges set by the GM.  Its part validation of design and part on-your-feet adapting to circmstances as you make chocies about husbanding resouces, select and time the use of your characters capabilities and cooperate with other players.<br/><br/>If you want to talk GNS, games that prioritize this type of player choice are associated with the gamist category.  But of course games can include these kinds of choices without them being the top priority.  What other kinds of meaningful choices can you think of and how do they work?  Associate them with a GNS category if you like.<br/><br/>~~<br/>I think poor RPGs dont conciously offer the player any type of meaningful choices.  Players get a bunch of choices, sure, but they arent real choices.  Whatever they decide simply amounts to 'pulling the handle' -- stuff happens, you pull the handle occasionally, but nothing the players do essentially matters.  These types of games are really unsatisfying and boring.  As an example, they often have  combat that amounts to a repetitive battle of attrition with a randomizer thrown in.  Support for meaningful choice in the game of any kind has to brought to the table by the GM, because there is no system support for it.  <br/><br/>Phew, thats enough rambling for now. sorry about the unstructured post.

A game might support/emphasise puzzle solving and mystery cracking choices.  <br/><br/>Actually I just  realized something - often games revolve around, or strongly emphasize particular player choices, such as problem solving, but may not actually provide correspondingly strong support for those choices - leaving it up to the players to provide their own level of support, if they can.  Id put the original CoC in this basket, for instance.<br/><br/>By way of example, Ill have try to describe the original CoC in these terms:<br/><br/>Moderately emphasizes, but weakly supports character effectiveness design and tactical execution choices.<br/>Strongly emphasizes, and moderately supports problem-solving choices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342424/#Comment_342424" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-12T14:47:56+00:00" title="September 12, 2011  2:47PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Im not sure that nar play has any meaningful choices for players to make, its more like story-boarding, isnt it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342436/#Comment_342436" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-12T15:47:40+00:00" title="September 12, 2011  3:47PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>Im not sure that nar play has any meaningful choices for players to make, its more like story-boarding, isnt it?</blockquote>\nWhat the fuck?

That phrase doesnt convey much in itself.  The premise of D&amp;D, near enough, is "players explore dungeons, kill monsters and take their stuff".  When you play D&amp;D your are frequently making choices that relate to that, but thats not what your talking about.<br/><br/>Rons essay uses the Egri-style premise which is about some kind of moral platitude.

This depends on the group, the game and the situation, and really, the purpose for which you are doing the evaluation. <br/><br/>But yes, sometimes the response to a transient situation might reveal a "Story Now" agenda of play.  What that means in terms of what you're trying to do is the question. Like, if you're trying to evaluate this whole group's year-long play, probably that single situation won't tell you much.

The GM might say, "Okay, he's in his study when you walk in..." But I still clearly left the "knowledge and perceptions of my character" to zip over in time and space to a whole new location.<br/><br/>Please note that the last phrase, "or even features of the world separate from the characters," has the clause, "or even" -- which means one might have added all the detail you're assuming one needs to do to make it Director stance... or not.<br/><br/>"I'm there," is one of the most commonly spoken phrases used by Players during an RPG game -- and it is pure Director stance.<br/><br/><br/>Anyway, as far as I can tell (and I'm not sure, because your questions all seem very strange and obscure) you're barking up the wrong tree.<br/><br/>The point isn't about Stances, if you're really curious about meaningful choices in GNS.<br/><br/>First, you have to get rid of your abominable notion about premise being about "moral platitudes."<br/><br/>What matters is that the Player has some sort of thematic material he wants to address. The Character, as in the other stances, matters... but it is the actual people at the table who matter more because they are, you know, real.<br/><br/>So, if we're playing <i>Sorcerer</i>, and Humanity is defined at "Loyalty" and I find out in one scene that my guy's father is cheating on my guy's mother, I might say, "I got to confront my father." I do this because I want to play toward the premise "Loyalty" and find out what happens in the scene as my Character is driven by my decisions that will produce actions and outcomes. In <i>Sorcerer</i>, the Game Master will frame the scene.<br/><br/>In <i>Fiasco</i>, the Player can start a scene of one two ways. One of them is to "Establish" -- "by framing it up, deciding who is involved, what it is about and where it is going down."<br/><br/>The point is this, however: The "meaningful choice" is not the framing of the scene nor has anything to do with the stance the player is in.<br/><br/>The meaningful choices that matter to Story Now play is what the Player's Character does when confronting his father. That's what a Player in the Story Now CA cares about. That's what is meaningful. Getting to the father is just something you have to do to get to chance <i>to make the meaningful decisions about loyalty</i> or whatever other thematic/emotional/moral choices are compelling to the Player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342504/#Comment_342504" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-12T21:59:58+00:00" title="September 12, 2011  9:59PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2011 10:13PM by noclue.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/stefoid">@stefoid</a> But, why does a game need to support directors stance to address premise with consistency? For example, Sorcerer only allows a player director stance when authoring the kicker. After that, it's still adddressing premise but the player is completely in the character's POV.<br/><br/>It's consistent. Multiple characters address different premises. Meaningful choices are required.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Christopher">@Christopher</a>, while I think your correct that saying you're at your father's house is director stance. There's not a lot of support for that kind of play in D&amp;D. It's an emergent behavior that happens all the time, but there's nothing in the book that says here's when the player gets narrative control and decides where the character is. Many games do support that behavior explicitly, Fiasco being a good example.<br/><br/>And I agree with you about "moral platitudes." Egri doesn't say anything about moral plattitudes. He says premise is essentially the same as theme, or root idea of a play. He says it is "a proposition assumed to lead to a conclusion." And he says a good premise is a clear premise.<br/><br/>Edit: and none of this gets me any closer to understanding how anyone could suggest there are no meaningful choices in nar games, when I think they are chock full of meaningful choices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342506/#Comment_342506" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-12T22:10:43+00:00" title="September 12, 2011 10:10PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd quickly suggest that in <i>Sorcerer</i> a Player will spend the vast majority of his time in Actor stance -- but will probably shift into the other two stances throughout the game. <br/><br/>On the other hand, I think Players in many games who think they spend all their time in Actor stand slip into the other two stances more than they're aware.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342509/#Comment_342509" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-12T22:15:36+00:00" title="September 12, 2011 10:15PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's probably true.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342510/#Comment_342510" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-12T22:15:46+00:00" title="September 12, 2011 10:15PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I realized that 'meaningful' choice is a bad term.  <i>Consequential </i>choice is much better.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>Anyway, as far as I can tell (and I'm not sure, because your questions all seem very strange and obscure) you're barking up the wrong tree.</blockquote>\nThey make sense to me, although the end result might not end up being fruitful, as in a useful tool for designing and describing games.

Im not sure of the best way to describe it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>The meaningful choices that matter to Story Now play is what the Player's Character does when confronting his father. That's what a Player in the Story Now CA cares about. That's what is meaningful. Getting to the father is just something you have to do to get to chance<i>to make the meaningful decisions about loyalty</i>or whatever other thematic/emotional/moral choices are compelling to the Player.</blockquote>\nwhich would be covered by one or more of the following types of choice, wouldnt it?<br/><br/>A theme inherent in your character - your character has a belief/issue/desire/etc... that affects their decisions<br/>A theme inherent in the situation - the characters will have to confront to resolve a specific situation.<br/>A theme inherent in the setting -  the characters will have to confront about the world they live in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342512/#Comment_342512" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-12T22:22:32+00:00" title="September 12, 2011 10:22PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2011 10:23PM by stefoid.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite><a href="/forums/profile/stefoid">@stefoid</a> But, why does a game need to support directors stance to address premise with consistency? .</blockquote>\nWhoah, the discussion is morphing from referencing GNS to zeroing in on nar-play, which is my fault.<br/><br/>I would really like to hear from people about the kinds of consequential choices available to sim-play experts, although I guess there might not be that many here, and Im probably hammering the lid shut on this thread by asking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342514/#Comment_342514" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-12T22:26:58+00:00" title="September 12, 2011 10:26PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>which would be covered by one or more of the following types of choice, wouldnt it?<br/><br/>A theme inherent in your character - your character has a belief/issue/desire/etc... that affects their decisions<br/>A theme inherent in the situation - the characters will have to confront to resolve a specific situation.<br/>A theme inherent in the setting -  the characters will have to confront about the world they live in.</blockquote>\nOh, yes. <i>Absolutely</i>!<br/><br/>It's your use of meaningful (or consequential) choices that's throwing me. The use of Stance or Framing is a <i>tool</i> used to get to those choices. In the same way certain games have tools to help the other two CAs.<br/><br/>The point is this, as an example: Both <i>Sorcerer</i> and <i>HeroQuest 2</i> allow a GM to stat out opposition to the PCs in very, very simple ways. (They are very different ways, by the way.) This is important, since in Story Now games you simply have no idea which way the Players are going lead the narrative. The Players make choices and then -- bam, we're here, confronting this guy the GM might never have thought much about. The fact that the GM can stat the opposition quickly and elegantly means that the freedom of the Players to go after the meaningful choices about themes/emotions/morals and discover what statement they make about them is never hindered.<br/><br/>This ability for the GM to do this is simply a tool to make this easier, in my view. In the exact same way, the Player asking for a scene ("I want to confront my father") is a tool to allow this as well.<br/><br/>When thinking about game design it isn't always a matter of what will make the meaningful choices happen, but what tools will allow the meaningful choices of different CAs happen more efficiently or easily that matters.<br/><br/>I'm tying to point out that if, in Fiasco, I say, "I go to my father's house," it isn't a consequential choice. It's a tool to getting to the choices that matter for Story Now play. It matters, as a technique, of course. But it is merely a means to an end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342516/#Comment_342516" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-12T22:44:15+00:00" title="September 12, 2011 10:44PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>It's your use of meaningful (or consequential) choices that's throwing me.

I've played and written a bunch about Threefold Simulationism - but my examples of this used to often be categorized as "vanilla Narrativism".

Yes, it's much harder for the system to reingforce the setting if the system wasn't designed for the setting.<br/><br/>I'm playing a Savage Worlds game right now. One of the things I did in setting it up was to hack the generic system so that it had more to do with the setting. I changed the skills into a stat+job matrix (similar to Leverage) and made jobs that would reflect the fairy tale setting - Woodsman, Scoundrel, Soldier, Witch, Servant, Noble. Making the system more strongly tied to the setting has helped the game be stronger.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342718/#Comment_342718" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-13T23:36:52+00:00" title="September 13, 2011 11:36PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 13, 2011 11:39PM by David_Berg.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am a lazy bastard and have not read the thread, but Steve asked me what constitutes a meaningful contribution in Sim play, i.e., what does a player do that is appreciated and why is it appreciated.<br/><br/>It is really hard for me to get more specific than "whatever your group is into, man" without quickly going into a small subset of Sim play.

It's pretty easy.<br/><br/>You've never played right to dream. You've played many kinds of story now. You're looking inside your own experience to find the diversity of the CAs, but it isn't in there. Same with everybody! In particular, I'd be surprised if 10 people here on SG had ever played right to dream. This isn't really the crowd for it, and it's rarer than we think even so.<br/><br/>The CAs' whole purpose is to help you see, not the diversity of your own play, but the diversity of possible play, including, most importantly, play that makes you go "ugh, <i>so</i> not a fan." Or, "but ... how is that even <i>fun</i>?" Or, "sure, but that's not <i>role</i>playing."<br/><br/>You see a continuum between story now and right to dream play because you're looking at a breadth of story now play, and misidentifying one side of it as right to dream.<br/><br/>I recommend that you do what a whole bunch of us have already done, which is to reclaim "simulationist" as the name for an approach to the techniques of play. That way you can be like, "check it out! At this end of the range, simulationist story now! At the other end, I dunno, dramatist story now! Spectrum!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342766/#Comment_342766" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-14T10:28:15+00:00" title="September 14, 2011 10:28AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, GNS is useful in that it's a good simplified answer as to why system matters. Because playing with a creative agenda that is not well reinforced by the system results in, for example, those "and we didn't even touch the dice" statements that come from Nar pupae who haven't broken their cocoons and become butterflies yet.<br/><br/>But, at best, it's a simplified answer.<br/><br/>Just like knowing that US politics are dominated by the Republican and Democrat party, plus some sort of thing (or things) that's sometimes called Independants and sometimes called other things. But just because you can categorize people into 3 buckets doesn't mean you can use that to explain how government works (or doesn't). Political parties are part of, for example, how a bill becomes a law. (Arguably an excessivly important part.) But there's lots of processes and procedures that have nothing to do with parties, but have to occur in order for it to happen.<br/><br/>Political parties tell you some stuff. And some of it is even important. But picking a party doesn't tell you how to run a government.<br/><br/>Likewise picking a creative agenda doesn't tell you how to run an RPG.                        </div>\n<div

"A lot" of games because (1) not every one will works, you will be able to play most of them with your old CA, "forgetting" half of the rules and "remembering" rules that aren't there. But if you stick with it, you'll find some games that will shock you, and (2) because if you try only one, you will mistake all his techniques for "the CA". With a lot of different games you'll be able to see that the techniques are not the CA.<br/><br/>This way, your investment will be "play fun games" and the return will be a lot bigger, in terms of understanding the difference between CAs.<br/><br/>THEN study the essays, to make sense of what you experienced. They will not be boring anymore, then, because they'll remind you or all these different games and make you want to play them again to play them better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342829/#Comment_342829" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-14T15:40:35+00:00" title="September 14, 2011  3:40PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Moreno,<br/>Where I struggle is taking games, ones I wish could match my referred CA, and refurbishing them to do that. <br/>I feel like that'd be a cool thread.

The same thing that happens when Indy fights anyone (as per the Indy Fight mechanic) -- blood, embarrassment, injury, humorous reactions to pain, collateral damage, and/or victory.  I roll "collateral damage" in this case and am called on to narrate that.  I find that I in fact can do that in a way that satisfies our group standards for Indy-ness.  Maybe I do a mediocre job -- "Right on, Dave, nice try, we see what you we're going for."  Or maybe I do an excellent job -- "Go Dave!  Awesome!"  There was some tension about Indy slugging a girl, but we made it work.<br/><br/>Not that "fight = collateral damage" couldn't be some other CA.  But, y'know, if that's key to "doing Indy" and you do in fact get players on board to "do Indy", then in that case "demonstrate wholeness" is being supported.<br/><br/>Advancement / character change that mirrors the arcs of the source material can also be good.  Likewise with adventure design or GM threat escalation.  Obvious versions of these can be fine, but nonobvious-but-hey-also-true can be more exciting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342882/#Comment_342882" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-14T20:45:15+00:00" title="September 14, 2011  8:45PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 14, 2011 8:47PM by stefoid.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            fucking blindspot!<br/><br/>yes of course.  sim play, by definition, is about something.

The GNS did a pretty good job of driving home the point that different games do different things and that a designer should focus the specific thing he wants to do with his game and proceed to do it.<br>But what would a taxonomy of choices give designers today? I think mostly ideas that haven't occurred to them - choices they didn't think were possible. Which is important, certainly. But I do think that such a taxonomy is only the tip of the iceberg, and the meat should be not on what choices are available, but rather on what a game designer should do with them once he decided he wants them in his game.<br/><br/>But, here are some more ideas as to possible choices. Tactical choices you've already mentioned. I think it'd be interesting idea to say that the decisions you make during character creation and development are strategy, while the decisions you make during the game itself - what power do I use right now, how do I allocate my fight and defense resources, where do I move my character, what enemy do I attack etc etc - tactics.<br/>There are also various decisions of 'where do I want to take the story' (the essential choices in Story Now if you ask me, while we're at it). It can be close to the character, as in FATE, where you choose what aspect (literally) of the character you want to emphasize in the current situation, or it can be much broader, as in, say, Houses of the Blooded.<br/>There are choices of 'what would my character do' - where you try to play your character as consistently as possible, trying to see how he reacts to different situations, and find it interesting to figure out those correct reactions. (I think that's in Right to Dream, by the way).<br/>There are moral decisions, which can be specific cases of story or character integrity above, but can also be brought all the way up to player level, where the player himself is asked what the correct thing to do is, and himself answers, with his character being only a method to demonstrate that answer. I'd almost call that a philosophical discussion in the veneer of role-playing (kinda like Hesse's Damian is a philosophical discussion in the veneer of a novel), but that somehow makes it sound derogatory, which isn't my point. Although if you gather a group of players that interested in having discussing philosophy and give them such a game, I could very well see them slowly forgetting the game and moving over to a pure philosophical discussion.<br/>You could dig into the above categories as well and subdivide even more. Actually, now that I think of it, if a real taxonomy of decisions is to be made, there'd need to be some levels and categories. It'd be counter-productive to just lump everything into one big pile, I think.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343785/#Comment_343785" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-23T17:47:27+00:00" title="September 23, 2011  5:47PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see it as a way of conveying information about a game, and another way to think about game design.
