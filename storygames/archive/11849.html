I got my initial inspiration from Michael Green's <em><a href="http://art.afterculture.org/" rel="nofollow">Afterculture</a></em>, but as much as I loved his work, I felt his, too, couldn't really live up to the task of filling in the details of a world where real cultural diversity has taken hold once again. Which is what inspired the wiki idea: I don't think any one person could do that.<br/><br/>I don't think the future will look like either of those, Logos. When you look over the long-term history of human life, complexity looks like a flash in the pan. Why should "the next big energy thing" even necessarily exist? I think we take for granted how much energy we have in fossil fuels to such a degree that we feel somehow <em>entitled</em> to plentiful, cheap energy; so, once we run through fossil fuels, naturally, some <em>other</em> abundant, cheap energy source <em>must</em> exist, right? Normally when I say that, people look very sad and call me a pessimist, but I also think lots of cheap, abundant energy leads to a lot of social complexity that doesn't always make life better, and in a lot of ways, makes it a whole lot worse. So, my game focuses on the ways in which people can enjoy healthier, more fulfilling lives in low-complexity, tribal societies. I've sometimes described it as the deep ecological answer to <em>Star Trek</em>\u2014a pseudo-utopian future based on nurturing relationships rather than creating technology, more Ursula LeGuin than Isaac Aasimov.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264565/#Comment_264565" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-30T16:41:36+00:00" title="March 30, 2010  4:41PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a book by J G Ballard called The Drowned World.

To try to steer this a bit back towards Jeff's original post...\n<blockquote><cite>Richard Manning in Against the Grain</cite>The Spaniards attempted to settle in what is now Argentina in the early 1500s, but failed. They did, however, leave behind some horses. When they returned to try colonization again in the 1580s, they found horses in abundance. A traveler at the turn of the seventeenth century reported horses "in such numbers that they cover the face of the earth and when they cross the road, it is necessary for travelers to wait and let them pass, for a whole day or more, so as not to let them carry the tame stock with them." In 1744, a Jesuit priest in the pampas reported herds of feral horses so numerous that it would take three hours for them to pass by "at full speed."</blockquote>\nHorses originally evolved in North America. They crossed Beringia during the Ice Age, and subsequently went extinct in the New World. When the Spaniards left some behind in the 1500s, they exploded, because they had a perfect habitat.<br/><br/>So, what do you think will happen with the elephants and lions picked up by zoos and the owners of various ranches, when they're allowed to spread out over the Great Plains that formerly supported mammoths and saber-toothed tigers? In <em>The Fifth World</em>, I've made references to the herds of elephants that roam Alberta, and the prides of lions that hunt them. In the same area, I've speculated that biker culture might trade in horses for hogs and become steppe-like nomads, the Viking/Hun horse nomads of the Great Plains.<br/><br/>Naturally, jungles would reach up into Texas, and evergreen forests would cover Antarctica and Greenland.<br/><br/>Plastic actually breaks down very quickly when exposed to sunlight, down to a translucent sand. So, I've often described the translucent plastic sand beaches of the Fifth World, about 88 meters higher up than today, because the ice caps have melted.<br/><br/>You can't talk to <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_stamets_on_6_ways_mushrooms_can_save_the_world.html" rel="nofollow">Paul Stamets</a> without coming away with some glimmer of how mushrooms will start trying to solve our problems pretty much as soon as we stop creating them. Mushrooms might evolve to eat nuclear waste. Will enormous mushroom blooms sit on old nuclear power sites? Will the nuclear symbol painted on rocks warn humans that these are areas set aside, sacred, places where humans should not go? I don't think animals will evolve to eat plastic in 400 years, but bacteria sure might\u2014even bacteria lining an animal's intestines. So you might have animals eating plastic anyway.<br/><br/>You might notice that a lot of things in prehistory just grew a lot bigger than things do today. Turns out this has everything to do with the concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere; with more oxygen, you can circulate blood more efficiently, so you can grow bigger. Scientists already expect rising carbon dioxide levels to help more plants grow, and plants release more oxygen. So, four hundred years from now, will carbon dioxide and oxygen make up a bigger percentage of the atmosphere? And will that mean we'll have giant versions of things?<br/><br/>I've heard of three things that will prompt faster rates of evolution: radiation (since it produces more mutations to work on), global temperature (since it puts more energy into the system), and the end of a mass extinction event (since it leaves plenty of room, both physically and in terms of empty niches, to fill). So, the next four hundred years will provide the first hat-trick the world's ever seen. Maybe we'll see a bunch of crazy new things evolving in a fairly short period of time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

They're more genetically diverse, work fewer hours in their lives than we in agrarian societies, and, when something paradigm shifting happens, they shift \u2014 what's to stop them? For the most part, "stoned to death for heresy" comes at the hands of states and other larger powers. The Salem witch trials were perpetrated by wealthy merchants suspiciously accusing of witchcraft other merchants that they owed money. The laws in Leviticus about stoning to death for antisocial behavior were obviously a threat that protected the society irrespective of the wellbeing of the individuals who made it up(curiously, never seem to have been actually enacted). "An Eye For an Eye" in the Code of Hammurabi comes from having a city-state.</p>\n<p>I don't mean to idylize (if that's a word \u2014\xa0if not, I'm awesome) tribal societies.

Doesn't every post-apocalyptic scenario have to start with the Statue of Liberty, to tell you where you are (right up there with a leading white male "so the audience has someone they can identify with," right?). In this case, the Atlantic Ocean rises up to Liberty's chest (if you go with complete ice cap melting and a resulting 88 meter sea level rise, that should be about right, if I've measured everything correctly). So, somewhere out in the ocean, you'll suddenly see this giant green woman rising up out of the depths. So when you really need an answer, you risk the trip out to the Water Oracle to seek an answer.<br/><br/>I also took the name "the Fifth World" from southwestern Emergence mythology. It seems like there's some elements of Hopi society that are really preparing for an expected collapse of civilization. So, I have a lot of Hopi post-apocalypse going out like evangelists, trying to help people sort out everything that happened. One in particular has taken up residence in the observation deck, and gives oracular pronouncements to people who come seeking the wisdom of the Water Oracle.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ron Hammack</cite>People need food and clean water, they need to treat their sick and injured, they need to build shelter against the elements, they need entertainment.</blockquote>\nAssuming that you're willing to call what tribal societies have "science" and "technology," sure.

But bog iron takes time to regenerate, so you'd only have some small quantities of it. That gives it a very different role in society. In Mongolia, blacksmiths count as shamans, for instance. The myths about Weyland give a pretty good feel for how the knowledge of how to work iron became something very rare, and the people who had it much sought-after. Early Scandinavians relying on bog iron tended to use it for tools that used other materials\u2014so, you just needed a little bit of iron to get the effect. So, for instance, they often preferred spears to swords. And the tools that they did have made of metal took on a mystical quality because of that. A lot of the stories of magical weapons probably had their start in that kind of scarcity. For instance, I've heard some people speculate that the legend of Excalibur may have arisen from one of the few Roman-crafted swords still floating around the island, when most others had to use spears and such.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

That's the non-controversial one. It's when you bring in the gay and suggest that it has a positive biological purpose that people get testy. Plus, it's the gay we're talking about here. Whenever you talk about it someone somewhere gets testy.<br/><br/>I'd also suggest that it's not merely our individual complexity that selects for the continuing presence of non-reproducing family members (grandmothers, gay people), but that humans' reproductive strategy appears to be founded at its root in the social unit. Each person enhances the survivability of her own genes by fostering the survival of those genes in her family members. We're social animals, and so we take this thing that is present in any mammal I can think of \u2014 a period of post-natal care \u2014 and multiply its power by caring not only for our own offspring, but for our parents, siblings, nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles, and grandparents. In each of those people is part of ourselves, part we're trying to see fostered and carried down. In other words, these non-breeders are still helping themselves out by taking care of their genes in their relatives.<br/><br/>And <i>because</i> we're complex, we also have this adaptation of socially-shared knowledge which enhances survivability. Non-parents can use the time they're not spending raising children expanding upon this knowledge, and sharing it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265452/#Comment_265452" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-04T12:39:32+00:00" title="April  4, 2010 12:39PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

Steel doesn't rust nearly as quickly as iron. Steel also requires a much higher temperature to smelt or even rework than plain old iron does.<br/><br/>Also, those pieces in the museums are generally armor and swords and such that people took care of, not stuff left in crumbling buildings that people might go trying to salvage. Whether you take care of something or leave it open to the elements makes all the difference. Imagine the guy, 400 years from now, who has one of the last surviving katanas, passed down from father to son with immense care and respect, in an unbroken line from the Tokugawa period. But compare that to, say, an iron swing my family put up that rusted to almost nothing in little more than 20 years, because we left it outside.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.
