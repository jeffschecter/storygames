Designing them to be easily connected to the setting, we ensure easy inspiration for the players, and make it simple to frame scenes from them. <br/><br/>Designing such cards to suit one particular setting, making them into true setting elements, they would help reinforce the setting and help players explore it.<br/><br/>Although each card is simple; having 50+ such cards would ensure variation. I believe the same card would inspire different scenes in different situations, so variation would be secured in that way too.<br/><br/>And with that amount of cards, we would be hard pressed to predict what card comes up next, and that would make some surprises for all players/leaders.<br/><br/>Any thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

Things with lots of information tend to be less effective; we have to evaluate many elements, to choose amongst them. The point here is to feed the player with some inspiring tidbit of information that helps him be creative. By doing that fast, the game does not loose out on so much narrative energy. Drawing a card is a mechanic, and as such you need to be very careful how the application of it influence game-play.<br/><br/>I believe this is a nice way to regulate the use of such cards (at least in a classical rpg); <br/>- a player may choose to frame scene by himself, with no card<br/>but <br/>- if he choose to draw a card; then he must use it in some way                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372678/#Comment_372678" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-13T07:40:56+00:00" title="April 13, 2012  7:40AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gosh, I did something like that ages ago.

One of the mechanics in the game is that a plot twist occurs when the players run through one of their decks: the plot cards are an aid for referees who aren't comfortable improvising twists out of thin air. When the task resolution deck is set out, one random plot card is drawn. It's got a keyword, some leading questions, and a little picture. The referee can mull this over; meanwhile, the card is placed under the deck so that when it runs out, the twist is revealed. The general thrust of the twist is already known to the referee, so foreshadowing can be sprinkled in during the lead-up, but the details aren't fixed until the card actually appears.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/doho123" title="doho123"><img alt="doho123" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/doho123">doho123</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372683/#Comment_372683" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-13T08:23:24+00:00" title="April 13, 2012  8:23AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like you want to pick up an old copy of Everway.

Drawings are a good idea, but same as words, the more specific their content, the less interpretations you may get from them. That's not necessarily a bad thing, you can narrow the focus to events and things that are more relevant to your setting. It's the same with phrases, though I'd reccomend just words instead. With 4 words per card and one drawing you could have up to 250 options in 50 cards. After testing I found that you need just one word to frame a scene, providing the game has already a setting and the PCs already have an interesting background.<br/><br/>I also find <a href="http://www.storyforgecards.com/" rel="nofollow">this</a> quite interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372709/#Comment_372709" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-13T10:04:33+00:00" title="April 13, 2012 10:04AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think F*CK YOUTH does this really well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372731/#Comment_372731" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-13T11:42:27+00:00" title="April 13, 2012 11:42AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm using cards in a similar way for the Matrix Game I hope to have out for Gen Con. <br/><br/>Snapshot: 1969 allows players to go to Woodstock, protest the war and do the sex drugs and rock n roll thing from a safe distance. <br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_372759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372759/#Comment_372759" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-13T14:03:11+00:00" title="April 13, 2012  2:03PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ParadoxBoy</cite>The<a href="https://houseofcardsrpg.wordpress.com/2012/02/07/house-of-cards-plot-cards-available-for-free/" rel="nofollow">optional plot cards</a>for<em>House of Cards</em>are are very similar to what you're talking about.</blockquote><b><a href="http://houseofcardsrpg.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/hoc-plot-cards.pdf" rel="nofollow">Those</a></b> are beautiful cards!

However; I believe players will relate to the totality of information on the card; they will not <i>ignore</i> info on the card, but read everything and evaluate it, and then choose to act on some of it. That reading and evaluation takes a handful of seconds, and those seconds are repeated every time a card is drawn. I see that as something that will slow down game-play.<br/><br/>I am particular in relation to mechanics that slow down game-play. My personal principles of design do not allow for such mechanics. It will be a constraint on techniques that is aimed at controlling tempo in the game. Balancing mechanics and techniques in such ways, with the intent of having game-play shift in speed on the whim of the GM/players, is something I like to do in my design.<br/><br/>So I need a card of mine to serve up a simple idea, immediately, so it may prompt <i>action</i>; the active framing of a new scene.<br/><br/>But your cards are still beautiful in design, and clearly shows support of the players. And <i>you</i> do not have to work tempo, like I do. I imagine players love to play with those cards.
