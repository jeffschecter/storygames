First, because they're most often presented in a wrong way, but most of all because people who play them know nothing of the japanese culture and mentality. Which is totally ok unless you've spent five years of your life studying it and their language, and three years working and living amongst them.<br/>I often thought: "why the japanese culture? Why not the indian, or mongolian, or an african one (any of them)?" I guess it's just because it's one of the most heard of (definitely wouldn't use the word "known") exotic settings in world pop culture...</blockquote>\nThen Wilhelm noted:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wilhelm</cite>I hate that, having games poisoned by actual knowledge.<br/><br/>You got all the Japan-themed games spoiled by living in Japan.<br/><br/>I got my favorite game Twilight 2000 spoiled by 15 months in the army, and other military themed games are no fun when playing with people without any similar background.</blockquote>\nHas this happened to you for some entire setting, game or just a facet of a game?

I often played with police officers, lawyers, scientists, people in various positions in the military, homeland security, computer security experts, martial artists, mediators / negotiators, and more. <br/><br/>So any topic dealing with their specialties, no matter how versed I was in the topic myself, I would always miss something and it would break their suspension of disbelief. Even if the real like computer hacker wasn't playing the computer hacker, it was still an issue (slighter, but still). <br/><br/>So when it came to someone's specialty, I always consulted with them about setting difficulties, obstacles, procedures, and consequences. It's not that different that delegating other GM responsibilities. In Burning Wheel I may not know how certain magic systems work so I will defer all rule judgements to any resident expert. In Shadowrun I even created a system where people with real life knowledge of a topic could pass bonus dice to either side of a conflict and narrate in details explaining why someone would have the advantage in that situation. <br/><br/>Unfortunately people often think they know more than they actually know. So even experts need to have a healthy sense of humility. It's always amusing when 1 expert vehemently argues that X is real and then another expert in the same field joins the game and actually makes a believable counterpoint and backs it up. Having worked in many professions relying on consultant experts and having to double check information, often experts don't have the full picture. Or things change. Or things are situation or location specific (your understanding of California law may not hold up in London). Sometimes breaking someone's suspension of disbelief is tied too closely to "I can't be wrong" or "this is tied to my self worth". It's important that even experts assumes they don't have the full picture and act as gentle consultants rather than absolute authorities (of course there are exceptions). And that any arguments about details aren't personal but a chance for everyone to learn. <br/><br/>An even better solution I've found is get away from real life as much as possible. And I love modern games so that can be especially tricky (it's why basic D&amp;D works so well). One way to do it is to ground our expectations in something concrete. We will watch a movie or TV show together and say... this is what we want out game to be about. Even the obvious flaws and inaccuracies sacrificed in the name of drama and fictional convenience. If we buy it in the movie, people tend to find it easier to bolster their suspension of disbelief. Every so often we will go back to the original inspiration for a reminder, that this game isn't simulating real life. <br/><br/>This is actually tied to the various Shared Imagined Spaces going on. Most of the fiction we imagine is not shared. And sometimes starting with cliches or "movie knowledge" helps get everyone on the same page, even if that same page is completely inaccurate. I then find it easier to evolve our shared knowledge to a more accurate understanding of "real life" slowly in game rather than overwhelm everyone upfront. I find a level of fluidity and selflessness is required. <br/><br/>Last night I observed a photographer try to use their light expertise to prove that there would be absolute no shadows in the scene so the shadow monsters couldn't appear. And them the CGI scene rendering expert explained why they were wrong. And the 2 experts argued. It was like playings Dogs in the Vineyard. Both Dogs are supposed to be right? Right?<br/><br/>Ultimately there is plenty that happens in games that break my expectations or understanding and I just roll with it unless it becomes a problem for the overall group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302101/#Comment_302101" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-24T09:47:35+00:00" title="November 24, 2010  9:47AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cthulhu games can be affected by people with too much knowledge.

All well and good until the designers decided to not put the background basis for the disruption into the book, and made a list of immune items that basically contradicted any mechanic I could think of from quantum mechanics and theoretical physics that might explain the disruption, and really turned it into a hyper-dimensional munchkin-bashing hammar.  &gt;,&lt;  The disruption effect is necessary so that dragons can fly and giant spiders can terrorize the adventurers.

I do get frustrated a lot, though. I'm a linguist, I do formal logic, I've work in an experimental context, I've written a shitload papers on a few dozen languages. All I've done for three years is look at language via specific human languages and write about it. I'm not trying to brag when I say I know a <i>lot</i> about how language works, or how we think it works at this point in human history.<br/><br/>It's extremely frustrating to see anyone write or say anything about language without doing their research. Here's a hint: "Eskimos" don't have hundreds of words for snow. They don't even have that many nouns in general, much less nouns about fucking snow. The language you speak doesn't alter how you can think about the world. The Irish have no discrete word for "yes" or "no", but they bloody well understand the goddamn concept of "yes" and "no".<br/><br/>Usually I run across this in fantasy games. People try to imitate Tolkien and make up their own languages. Except they forget the part where Tolkien was a linguist, a lexicographer, and a scholar. He was serious about that shit, and he made sure it was believable, interesting, and most importantly interesting to read about. Stringing together random sounds, assigning weird orthography, and throwing in apostrophes does not make your setting any more interesting--it makes it less believable and harder to grok. Yes, even if you italicize the made up words. <i>Stop it.</i><br/><br/>I guess it comes down to this: just because you speak a language doesn't make you an expert on language. I have a set of eyes that I use all the time; that doesn't make me a fucking expert on optics. Do your goddamn research and be a responsible creator.<br/><br/>Okay I'm done.

Is that really surprising? ^_^<br/><br/>And if you were to write a game, would you reflect this belief in your depictions of the different intelligent races/cultures in the game?  <br/><br/>I think there's a balance being struck here, and it's generally struck against special levels of expertise.  Suppose you're writing a game background (I believe that it's generally backgrounds, and not mechanics which people are talking about here).  You will have many opportunities to put in neat little pieces of color about the setting.  Take language for example - I see 3 options: 1) Do extensive linguistic research to develop plausible languages for your setting, 2) Be vague about the languages in the setting, so as to avoid saying anything which is wrong, 3) Make up some cool-looking alphabets and bits of vocabulary to give people some idea of the feel of the different languages.<br/><br/>Most game designers will not have the time or the inclination to pursue option 1.  Option 2 is easy, but bland (not necessarily bad - I would bet that Universalis has no incorrect factlets to make people wince).  Option 3 is the most popular, and I think for good reason - for every linguist who goes 'That doesn't make any sense!' you'll get a couple dozen people happily figuring out how to translate 'Phoenix Dark Dirk'  into the appropriate language for their character.<br/><br/>I think this thread could be useful with more specific examples.  This forum is read by a lot of game designers, and while they can't spend the time necessary to become an actual expert, if they see someone complaining about something, they'll probably try to avoid including it in their game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302682/#Comment_302682" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-29T21:38:18+00:00" title="November 29, 2010  9:38PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grover</cite>And if you were to write a game, would you reflect this belief in your depictions of the different intelligent races/cultures in the game?</blockquote>\nNope.

Here's a hint: "Eskimos" don't have hundreds of words for snow. They don't even have that many nouns in general, much less nouns about fucking snow. </blockquote>\n"Eskimos have so many words for snow! They have one for slush, one for powder, one for hard pack, one for blizzards and another for drifts, and even one for individual snowflakes..."<br/><br/>(Doesn't Aleut language most that thing as verbing?)\n<blockquote>The language you speak doesn't alter how you can think about the world. The Irish have no discrete word for "yes" or "no", but they bloody well understand the goddamn concept of "yes" and "no".</blockquote>\nThe best fiction I've ever seen of this is Iain M. Banks' <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Player_of_Games" rel="nofollow">Player of Games</a>, where instead of doing this stuff with language, it's a game. But it's not like the society plays by the explicit rules of the game; they interact in subtle and profound ways. It's a really neat exploration of the interplay of culture and symbols. I'd say that lacking "yes" and "no" probably has a largely unpredictable effect on a society, since it's only one of a progillion cultural influents. Like, don't you never say "no" to someone in Japanese? That has a pretty strong effect on the culture, I'd say.\n<blockquote>Usually I run across this in fantasy games. People try to imitate Tolkien and make up their own languages. Except they forget the part where Tolkien was a linguist, a lexicographer, and a scholar. He was serious about that shit, and he made sure it was believable, interesting, and most importantly interesting to read about. Stringing together random sounds, assigning weird orthography, and <b>throwing in apostrophes</b> does not make your setting any more interesting--it makes it less believable and harder to grok. Yes, even if you italicize the made up words.<i>Stop it.</i></blockquote>\nGood god, the apostrophe thing's infuriating. It's just that it's the only diacritic we use in modern English, so it looks all fancy. When people discover the circumflex, they go absolutely cr\xe2zy. I'm a proponent of the re\xefntegration of the diaresis into our language, frankly. A coop is where you keep chickens. A co\xf6p is where they make decisions about how to sell their eggs.<br/><br/>There's a book called the <a href="http://www.zompist.com/kit.html" rel="nofollow">Language Construction Kit</a> that gives people the tools they need to do this stuff with some dignity. I'll be selling it in a bundle with Human Contact so players who want some of that action can do it effectively, but you might want to pick it up before then. The rules for Human Contact take a much glossier (though compatible) view; you need people's and places' names, for instance, and then you need words for things we have to describe every time as modern English speakers, but the culture considers normal and abbreviates. We had a word for "Your mother who has become socially male by joining the military," for instance.<br/><br/>So...
