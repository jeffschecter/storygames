Food Holes is the competitive eating hack for Contenders that Remi and I are writing.  <br/><br/>Remi played \xe2\u20ac\u0153Slim\xe2\u20ac\x9d Porkins, a morbidly obese eater from Bemidji, Minnesota with an overbearing father who happened to be addicted to smack.  Joe played Sheila \xe2\u20ac\u0153The Disposal\xe2\u20ac\x9d Watkins, a Detroit housewife with an unemployed husband and OCD.  I played Mark \xe2\u20ac\u0153Scrapie\xe2\u20ac\x9d Turgeon, a cadaverous amoral Scotsman with a twin sister whose deformed heart was simply too small to support life.  <br/><br/>Sounds hilarious, right?  Well, it was, but it was also punctuated with really sad moments and some genuinely touching scenes.  We aimed for that, because straight gonzo would have been too easy, and Food Holes delivered just like Contenders does, but the humor adds some stark relief to the sad, quiet scenes.  So we had Slim trying to convince his dad that he had worth, even though he couldn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t win a competition to save his life, and Sheila learning just how far she was willing to go to win (farther than Joe was!) and Scrapie Turgeon learning that his sister\xe2\u20ac\u2122s cardiac surgeons were a pair of useless louts.  I kicked everyone's ass until the climactic battle between Scrapie and Sheila, where I lost in the first minute with a vomit-soaked neurotoxic jellyfish blowout (don't ask, for the love of God).<br/><br/>Mechanically we\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve added a sub-system to Contenders related to food type, and this got a workout.  I was concerned that it would add too much complexity and handling time, but it doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t.  Our other concern is the porting of traits and techniques from boxing to eating, and that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s still inelegant \xe2\u20ac\u201c we found ourselves falling back on boxing metaphors too often, and I think the game language can correct that.  <br/><br/>Three changes to Contenders we need to mull over \xe2\u20ac\u201c first, the ability of a competitor to give when the outcome is pre-ordained; second, the ability to raise multiple competition traits simultaneously in training scenes, if you have enough cash; and finally, a penalty for using the same technique twice in a row during a competition (to prevent front-runners from coasting on defensive moves).  These all seem like positive changes, but need further testing.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90941/#Comment_90941" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T07:51:41+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  7:51AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2007 7:52AM by Remi.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would also like to point out that Joe/Sheila got two consecutive first-round reversals, which was just ugly. We also never touched using Hope or Pain in open competition. I, once again, didn't win a single bout.<br/><br/>That was fun.<br/><br/>One thing I really enjoyed, and we did it really naturally, was a sort of improvised 'opening segment' to the fights. We'd each create a quick persona (BIG BOB MACKILHENNY'S HOUSE OF BEEF! WE'RE YER BLOODY BUDDIES!) and run with it for a minute or two to set the scene of the competition. Big Bob, ESPN 7, the entire family of sportscasters, and the X-FOOD EXTEME TAFFY EATING COMPETITION feat Creed were some really fun things to come out of this. Free playing this interstitial stuff is really important, in my experience, to keeping the game fun. <br/><br/>Strangely, the training scenes, with the exception of the first one, fell a little flat. I wonder why that is.<br/><br/>I think suggestion pages for all aspects of the FOOD HOLES world (types of food eaten, types of training, food records and median scores, maybe a place name randomizer?) would all be useful tools to really wringing the most out of the game. It doesn't have to be really specific, just give people an idea of the scope of the world. I really like the globe-trotting feel, as well. Playing up the 'new sport' aspect seems like it could be fertile ground.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
