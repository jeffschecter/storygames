My experience is still pretty limited, a few months of playing Apocalypse World and hacks thereof, but I'm already impressed and definitely not eager to go back to D&amp;D. I would, however, like to return to the Ravenloft setting at some point. I just don't know what story game system would work best for it. I definitely want to run something in the long term, so games that are meant for one-shots or only a few sessions are out, but other than that, I don't even really know what options are out there, so I welcome any suggestions.<br/><br/>Of course, I'm not even sure if a story game is appropriate for Ravenloft, or at least the way I would run it. Certainly, a villain whose dark passions and sinister goals drive the typical gothic horror plot and the sense of powerlessness and fear of the unknown on the part of the characters seem to run counter to the Apocalypse World principles of letting the players drive the plot and allowing them to be the baddest asses. I don't know enough to know if that's typical or not, but I imagine I would need a story game with different principles if it's going to work at all.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401941/#Comment_401941" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-28T10:56:52+00:00" title="December 28, 2012 10:56AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could certainly investigate Annalise.

It's a difficult mix to give the player power and also expect the character to be powerless.<br/><br/>I'm interested to see what others suggest.

This is a bit of a specialty of mine.  To the point that I make the joke that I judge all RPGs based on how well they will let me run Ravenloft.<br/><br/>Here's a caveat: I actually consider the Darklords of Ravenloft to be better PC material than people fighting the Darklords.  That doesn't mean that I run games where the PCs are evil Darklords just that I prefer my Gothic games where the PCs are passionate people walking on the edge of darkness.  For example I consider Manfred to be a stronger "PC type" in Castle of Otronto than Theodore.  Ambrosio from The Monk is another good example of how I like my Gothic PCs built.<br/><br/>That said here's a list of things I've actually done:<br/><br/>Leverage - This game has already been mentioned in this thread complete with a link to a more detailed write up.  This is the strongest "canon" game of Ravenloft I've played.  The PCs are robin hood like thieves taking down Darklords.  You can do what I do and use modules as the basis but there's no reason you can't run the idea with your own job setups.  The two fit together very well as I outline in the linked discussions.<br/><br/>Dungeon World - I actually just ran a very successful Dungeon World game set in canon Ravenloft.  I crafted a scenario around my favorite under used Darklord Tristessa.  It ran beautifully and it really show cased the Bard playbook.  Bards become BADASS in Ravenloft because they have direct access to the Darklord's backstory which is, in my opinion, key to a good Ravenloft adventure.  The note here is that it still felt like Gothic D&amp;D.  It was AWESOME Gothic D&amp;D but D&amp;D none the lesss.<br/><br/>Sorcerer (plus its supplement Sorcerer &amp; Sword) I have run NUMEROUS games of my Gothic setup for Sorcerer &amp; Sword.  The caveat here is that I absolutely do not use canon Ravenloft.  The reason is that Sorcerer &amp; Sword does not work well when you try to make it fit an existing canon setting.  Instead I run it heavily INSPIRED by Ravenloft and the Gothic source material.  This game hits the themes I care most about in a Gothic setting.  Passionate, powerful people living on the edge of darkness.  Memorable moment from this setup: PC had a fight with her undead Grandmother on the edge of grave the PC had dug as a "Contain" to permanently bury her Grandmother.<br/><br/>Here's a list of things I have not done but would like to try:<br/><br/>Burning Wheel - My friend Colin ran a very successful game of Burning Wheel set in canon Dark Sun.  I would like to try the same thing for Ravenloft some day.<br/><br/>My Life with Master - I've always wanted to try running a game of this where we pick a Darklord from Ravenloft as the Master.<br/><br/>Lacuna - Replace "Mystery Agent" with "Agent of the Dark Powers".  Replace "Hostile Personality" with "Budding Darklords on the Prime Material Plane."  Go.<br/><br/>Conspiracy of Shadows - Similar to my desire with Burning Wheel and might actually be better fit.<br/><br/>In case you can't tell I LOVE, LOVE talking about using different games with Ravenloft and other Gothic material.  If you have any questions about my noodling I'd be happy to answer them.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401965/#Comment_401965" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-28T14:55:01+00:00" title="December 28, 2012  2:55PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lately, I've been having fun using Don't Rest Your Head for all kinds of stuff.

So, I'd replace exhaustion with "stealth" and say that crashing has the effect that THE DARKLORD KNOWS WHERE YOU ARE!

Very Dracula/Van Helsing or a more intriguey masquerade of the red death type game with decadent nobles in Richmulot or maybe something on that plantation island with the zombies.... <br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle" title="Paul_Riddle"><img alt="Paul_Riddle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle">Paul_Riddle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402368/#Comment_402368" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-01T12:25:44+00:00" title="January  1, 2013 12:25PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could also just play D20 Ravenloft using story gaming principles and methods. <br/><br/>I had a similar vector into story gaming and I've found it rewarding to return to D&amp;D, for example, with a different perspective and enjoy playing it as a story gamer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402369/#Comment_402369" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-01T12:31:03+00:00" title="January  1, 2013 12:31PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I second My Life with Master!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402567/#Comment_402567" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-03T07:05:25+00:00" title="January  3, 2013  7:05AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a very awesome Burning Wheel Ravenloft campaign.
