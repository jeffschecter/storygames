DIY is good, period. And there is this disdain for computer based randomizers (actually I'm fine with them but let's accept that a randomizer physically present in your hands has an edge). Still I like something about computer science: playing with binary numbers. I know I'm already knee deep in nerdspace. Sorry it won't improve, please hit the "back" button now if you're appalled. <br/><br/>A number can be represented in binary, that means only two digits are available : 0 and 1 (yay me!)<br/>So if you see this binary number 10101 it starts to be a little difficult without practice, or without going into details :<br/><code>10101(binary) = 1 * 2pow4 + 0 * 2pow3 + 1 * 2pow2 + 0 * 2pow1 + 1 * 2pow0 = 16 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 21</code><br/>where 2powN means 2 power N (2pow0 = 1, 2pow1 = 2, 2pow2 = 4 ....)<br/><br/>Right now I've got the math/computer geeks thinking "well duh" and the others going "booooriiiiing". Let me toss pennies in here !<br/><br/>So each digit of a binary number could be randomized by the toss of a penny, right? right. So for a randomizer equivalent to a d8 one needs 3 pennies. 4 pennies for a d16 etc... So a <b>BinaPenny randomizer</b> (there I named it) would be better used for dX type of randomizers, where X= 2powY. that's a first limitation.<br/><br/>The next problem is when tossing a lot of pennies how do I know which penny correspond to the higher digit, and the next one and the next one... Well given a flat surface where the pennies landed and given the position of the guy who tossed, we could rule that "the higher penny is on the extreme left of the tosser view, and next bits are read by reading next pennies from left to right". It should work, except for the weird cases of pennies aligned from the tosser POV. <br/><br/>Well ok so now I've got a binary number randomly generated by throwing pennies on a table. It still didn't make binary representation easy on most gamers. We still prefer decimal numbers in general (OK except for time and weird non-metric units). Sure I can solve that by having a sheet of paper with let's say the first hundred binary numbers and their decimal translation. Weak sauce. That's where story-games design geniuses kick in.<br/><br/>Who wants to improve on this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229869/#Comment_229869" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-03T12:10:44+00:00" title="September  3, 2009 12:10PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh...that's funny.

I think that's when one would have to create a game that exploits the exponential wackiness. <br/><br/>I'm imagining a device with N <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Pop-o-matic_video.ogg" rel="nofollow">top-o-matic</a> type of devices. With a dial that sets the number of pennies used, and the bottom of the top-o-matic would be treated so they detect if it's face or tail and a little electronic chip would do the sum for you... OK so I'm back to the computer randomizer, except made of plastic, wood and silicon. Great.

Reminds me of the "computerized" dice roller that actually conveyed dice to drop into a "dice tower," scanned them with OCR when they stopped in a rack at the bottom, then passed them back to the conveyor. Rube Goldberg would be proud.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Frederik J. Jensen</cite>How about combining it with rules on bit switching after the throw? E.g. allowing a player to flip one bit by spending a token? Or perhaps it should cost a token pr magnitude of the bit flipped.</blockquote>NEAT! And, actually, if you're VERY careful with the coins you use, so that they are all identical, then you wouldn't use the "token per magnitude" because you wouldn't know what magnitude/power of coin you were about to flip, if it was tails. This is, to my mind, a feature not a flaw: it adds an element of chance to bit-flipping. Whereas if you knew the magnitude of the coins, wouldn't you always bit-flip the lowest or highest, the one that pushes your result to the threshold goal?<br/><br/>As for the exponential range, it would work for a game where very high power and low power characters often interact: supers, god/mythological, humans vs. machines, forest animals of all sizes (not just rodentia and birds).<br/><br/>@ Ben Wray - Why? Because that's the point of the thread, I think: coins as randomizers, using binary, and how such a base mechanic can be improved and applied. :<br/><br/>I, for one, think it would rock for LARP, with a limited scale (say 3 to 5 coins) that could be done just by shaking a closed handful of coins and opening it palm-up, to see what's revealed. With "attributes" or "traits" or "foo" ranging from, say, 2 coins to 5, you get a spectrum of 0-3 and 0-31. Obviously, the cost for each "rank" (coin count) of a trait would be similarly exponential, for balance (for LARPers who are big gam/sim players--pipe down, you Scandinavians!).<br/><br/>Wait... doesn't NWOD LARP use coins like that, but with something like pennies as 0/1 and nickles as 0/5? You could represent ranks as P:N, much like the scores for Gaelic Rules and (IIRC) Aussie Rules Football.<br/>1 = 1:0<br/>2 = 2:0<br/>3 = 3:0<br/>4 = 4:0<br/>5 = 0:1<br/>6 = 1:1<br/>... (basically base five, yah?)<br/>Then you just count by fives and then by ones, which should be easy: "five, ten, eleven, twelve" for a two nickle heads and two pennies Heads result (for any number of coins tossed that result in those four Heads). I KNOW this has been done--didn't we have a thread on The Forge about this about five years ago? Or RPG.net?
