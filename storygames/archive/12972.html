However, if you're not careful, you can end up in one of these failure conditions:<br/><br/>- The narration has nothing to do with the mechanic and loses some impact. (Parlor narration, right?)<br/><br/>- Players take the pure mechanical route. ("I always want Hammer Dice, so I'll always act Romantically")<br/><br/>- Flat narration to squeeze in a bit more of an obvious bonus. (Example: some Wushu play, when each extra Stunt die is so useful. "I kick him in the face (1), and in the face (+1), and in the face (+1)." This example is obviously too flat to be accepted; but in any case, this is a player forcing themselves to generate content, rather than being rewarded for content they wish to generate.)<br/><br/>Is there a line at which incentivized RP is no longer effective?

If the game is based on the the story of Hephaestus and his romances, hammer dice might indeed be sensibly linked to romantic behaviour and it would be logical.   Joe the carpenter getting better at carpentry thanks to his girlfriend, not so much.  <br/><br/>Situation 2: <br/>Best solved by rewarding behaviours that are problematic.   Give the hammer die only if your romance restricts your actions or causes you do do something foolish.   <br/><br/>Situation 3<br/>It all depends on sensible limits on the maximum incentive.    I also tend to build "in a new fashion" or "in a creative fashion" in my incentive mechanics.    I kick him in the face only works the first time, if at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292386/#Comment_292386" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-08T19:25:51+00:00" title="September  8, 2010  7:25PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DevP</cite>Is there a line at which incentivized RP is no longer effective?</blockquote>\nMechanistic "Hammer Dice for acting Romantically" mechanics that aim to program player behavior are often very dumb about social motivation. What happens with the intimacy/desperation/sincerity dice in My Life with Master is that if your roleplaying for the bonus is weak, another player has the opportunity of delivering something interesting and different that takes the bonus away from you.

In one regard the whole point of the scene is to get a buff for a future battle.  But because you're already in the scene and  you choose it in preference to other explicit kinds of scenes your purpose is understood it feels more relaxed to me.  <br/><br/>It's the "Connection scenes" in Contenders.  It doesn't feel stilted because the explicit purpose of the scene is to connect with your Connection and the scene begins and ends with that one goal.  It's a few years old and I personally think it's hot tech, but it's pretty unexplored territory as far as use or hacking for other games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292391/#Comment_292391" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-08T19:53:23+00:00" title="September  8, 2010  7:53PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is it hammer dice for acting romantically and nothing for other ways of acting or hammer dice for acting romantically, flute dice for acting like a jerk, pencil dice for risking your life heroically and wolf dice for being a coward?<br/><br/>If you have different choices, and each choice is rewarded differently with different implications then it's good.

These actions are broadly described, but they make sure, that the player uses variation and it also reminds the player of what kinds of variations there (e.g. kick, head butt, punch, slap, hurt knuckles, nosebleed etc.).<br/>2) The player asks a another player to do the narration. It works quite well and is rather funny. E.g. I want to punch the opponent, but instead of me describing it, and I turn and ask another player to do it. This adds a whole new level of description and removes the repitive flatness.<br/>Here are two examples of the use from my blog:<br/><a href="http://mortengreis.wordpress.com/2010/08/12/the-art-of-doing-it-cool/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://mortengreis.wordpress.com/2010/08/12/the-art-of-doing-it-cool/</a><br/><a href="http://mortengreis.wordpress.com/2010/09/03/rule-of-the-day-embarrassing-moments/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://mortengreis.wordpress.com/2010/09/03/rule-of-the-day-embarrassing-moments/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_292430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292430/#Comment_292430" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T02:29:02+00:00" title="September  9, 2010  2:29AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 9, 2010 2:30AM by TomasHVM.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DevP</cite>Is there a line at which incentivized RP is no longer effective?

You may fantasize any consequence within the parameters of the genre, and get away with it, at least as long as it drives the drama and feeds the imagination of the other players.<br/><br/>In games with focus on realism, the effectiveness of incentives will vary dependent on theme:<br/>- Themes within the experience of most players, will lend themselves very well to such game-play; the players will intuitively know what to do, how to react and what consequences to expect. And the game will be better for it.<br/>- Themes outside the experience of the players, is not suited to incentivized game-play. The incentives may guide them on what to do, but are seldom effective in guiding them in how to react, and are far from giving good guidance on consequences. In games like these you need methodic tools (both narrative- and mechanical-tools) to help the players discover the consequences and conditions produced by the character-actions, and to help them into realistic reactions.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">War</span> is one theme that demands methodic support to be played out in a realistic way. Most players have little or no knowledge of what a soldier goes through, and are ill-equipped to interpret realistic characters in conditions of war. The same is true for most other themes of violence too; most people dont do it, and don't experience it, so they just don't know what will hit/kill/shock/stun/break them in a fight, or what it will do to them after the actual violence is over.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_292439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292439/#Comment_292439" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T03:27:38+00:00" title="September  9, 2010  3:27AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have been doing this with 0 Hunters<br/>\n<br/>\nI have yet to hit a point where incentivized RP does not have the effect desired.
