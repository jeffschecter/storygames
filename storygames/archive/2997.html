My AP blog, The Reality Vault, can be found <a href="http://www.realityvault.net/blog/games/games.html" rel="nofollow">HERE</a>.<br/><br/>Please help me make this work.  What do you want to see in an actual play?  How long should it be?  Should characters be details and the whole nine yards.  I will post to this about three times a week and my wife will post some of her experiences as well.  Once I get it down and I think it's spinning into something folk find worthwhile then I will begin to ask for other contributers and I aim for six posts a week.<br/><br/>This coming sessions I am going to attempt to record the sessions so we'll see how that goes.  Anyone know someone that might want to edit those and have a podcast-like AP blog?  That probably for another thread, though.<br/><br/>Your input in invaluable to me.

I usually try to add some relevant details that illustrate things that were important about the session, and these will always vary.  Typically they are metagame things, people's choices, how the system worked, powerful moments, whatever.  Stuff that is reflective and useful to a reader considering playing the game, highlighting stuff that worked (whether social or systemic) as well as stuff that didn't.  I think the very very best AP reports are really AP <i>dialogues</i>, where players and GM discuss what happened over multiple posts.  So I also try to open it up to conversation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68306/#Comment_68306" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-10T12:19:02+00:00" title="May 10, 2007 12:19PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From my perspective (long-time dissatisfied traditional gamer, cluelessly enthusiastic indie gamer), what I'd really like to see in Actual Play posts is... <i>actual play.</i><br/><br/>When I read an AP that says, like, "We played an awesome session of System Y last night where Bob's character ended up blowing up the planet, but overcame his fear of commitment in the process," that's <i>cool</i> and a lot of fun to read, but it doesn't really help me much* when I'm trying to pick a system to check out and pitch to my limited pool of potential players.<br/><br/>What I'm interested in is <i>how</i> System Y enabled that sequence of events to come to pass. I want to see the mechanics in action. I want to see how Bob declared <i>this</i> goal and rolled <i>these</i> dice and spent <i>that</i> resource and then Mary jumped in and added <i>this</i> and <i>this</i> and here's what happened. <br/><br/>Obviously, it's unreasonable to expect someone to type up an entire session's worth of that stuff, but a paragraph or so detailing the mechanics of one key scene can go a long way in communicating how a game works. That's why I think actual play podcasts are so awesome. Reading reviews of DitV made me go "hmmm", reading AP posts of DitV made me go "OK, that sounds pretty cool." It wasn't until I listened to Fred Wolke's DitV AP podcasts that I realized that I <i>must</i> obtain and play this game at any cost.<br/><br/>I do realize, of course, that selling me on a particular game system isn't necessarily what AP posts are <i>for</i>. Sometimes the purpose of an AP post is just to go, "We played this game the other day and this is what happened. Aren't my friends awesome!?" There's totally nothing wrong with that, and I <i>do</i> enjoy reading those kinds of posts. But you did mention that you wanted to <i>review</i> games through AP and I think that's a great use for them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(* Not that I think that someone posting an AP experience has any responsibility to help me with anything.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68307/#Comment_68307" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-10T12:23:18+00:00" title="May 10, 2007 12:23PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Don,<br/><br/>For me, a great Actual Play post centers on what you learned.

Sort of like some wargame replays that you may have read in The General or other wargame magazines where the players first wrote down what the moves were in a partucular turn, then described why they made the moves they did.  In the wargame replays, the players often kept a journal during play.  So, in the replay, the reader would get to understand the perceptions of each player about what he or she thought was happening.  That journal entry could be compared to the other player's entry for the same turn.  Classic 'fog of war' type issues--even in a boardgame with nearly perfect information--except enemy intent.    <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71094/#Comment_71094" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T10:45:44+00:00" title="May 22, 2007 10:45AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, fist off I put in a new AP about our Fantasy Dogs game that I'd like some input on.  There are some play examples missing and I am going to add those after tonight (along with tonight's game run by Joanna - yay!).  <br/><br/>However, the goal of updating this thread is a quandry I am in.<br/><br/>I have a PTA, 5 episode series I have been running.  It's going great!  I want to talk about it but I don't want to run folk off my blog with long anecdotes that go no where other than as fiction.<br/><br/>That being said, I'm having a hard time finding anything meaningful to talk about.  I mean the process is cool and I plan on recording our next session if I can find a good (read: cheap) piece of recording software.  But we can't find much in the way of concerns or snags or things we can do differently.  No doubt they exist.  I have no illusions that there are things that we can improve upon.  But we're having fun and everyone is really impressed with how the game is going.<br/><br/>This sorta tells me that a game that goes well (based on some of your advice) is not really worth talking about.  No doubt the more accurate interpretation is that I am having a hard time finding a way to word what I should be writing.<br/><br/>Help me out.  Give me food for thought.  What do you want to know about our PTA experiences?  What do you want to know about the process?  What have you're fears and hopes been and how might our experiences enlighten the process for you?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
