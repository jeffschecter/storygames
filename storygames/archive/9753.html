The first game wasn't actually very interesting, or long, so I decided to play again, and I could not be happier that I did.  Jackson, you've really managed to evoke the texture of a dream. <br/><br/>In the end of my second game, I was coming to believe that The Hollow Lady had taken the Clockwork Heart, and, tragically Her own Heart, while The Witch of Brass and A Thief kept me from accumulating an inventory that would let me deal with The Hollow Lady to get my heart (or Hers) back.  I kept running through the rooms, futilely searching for something, anything, to do, running into the unhelpful Faerie of Concord, tumbling down Halls of Mirrors, until... The Merchant King appeared, offering my Heart to me, seemingly out of nowhere (The Jack of All Trades had something to do with it).  I had nothing to trade to him, but my companion fleeced him and presented me with my missing heart.<br/><br/>I am just full of ideas about this game now \u2014 how it relates to Baker's recent explorations of IIEE, how well it conveys the flavor of dreaming, how a moderately complex mechanical device (the ordering of the deck) can provide state to a story game.  And I can't wait to play it several more times \u2014 I still want to find out what happens to "that other person", what happens when A Venerable Unicorn is fully marked, and what The Boy with Unruly Hair does.  I'm honestly not reading anything I haven't been instructed to read, because the revelation in-game is so enjoyable.<br/><br/>And more, I can see new design space opening up for single-player story games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218184/#Comment_218184" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-14T00:05:39+00:00" title="July 14, 2009 12:05AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with you, Colin, but in my play and thoughts I think I've been focusing a little more on the game as <i>game</i>, if that makes any sense, and I can't help but realize that the win condition for the game seems to not really have much at all to do with what I enjoy about play--namely, the discovery.

We agree totally, I think, on the relative importance of exploration and revelation vs "winning.".  How much does it matter that the game asks you to pretend that you'd like to win and get your heart back? It is an interesting question.<br/> <br/>What I do like about having winning as a goal is the structure it gives to the emerging story, and the way it challenges you to hold off on finding your heart while you explore some facet of the game world. I intentionally got the heart out of the way in my third game, for instance, to develop the relationship with the wolf-blood girl. And I enjoyed the process of trapping the heart in a prism, sending it to the Thicket Edge... and finding it again when I found myself alone in the end. That's story material.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
