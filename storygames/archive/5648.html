It is something that the last playtest threw up with Cath.<br/><br/>As the game progresses the players give the nemesis threat. Every scene each player gives the nemesis an amount of threat equal to the act number. This does of course mean there is an exponential build and in the last game I played the nemesis had 19 threat at the end and nothing to do with it really. This is obviously not right. Threat should be threatening and at the moment it just builds and is useless at the end.<br/><br/>Threat is used by the nemesis to make resources that are then anted in action. At the moment the nemesis can get those back if the hero fails.<br/><br/>I can see a few solutions:<br/><br/>1) The nemesis gets a static amount of threat each scene, 2 say. I like the build as it ties in well to the nemesis getting more prominent as the game progresses, so would prefer not to have to resort to this.<br/><br/>2) The nemesis needs to be encouraged to be more proactive in act 3. At the moment he gets one scene a round, but I could introduce something where he can buy extra scenes in order to do more to the heroes. <br/><br/>3) Make it that the nemesis spends, rather than antes, resources so that he has to top them up all the time with threat. This is more thematically appropriate I think.<br/><br/>4) Allow the nemesis to spend threat to muck around with how the system works for resolving a piece of action.<br/><br/>Or possibly a combination of these things. At the moment I see the act structure like this:<br/><br/>Act 1: finding out about the heroes and the nemesis<br/>Act 2: The heroes gather their forces and fight back<br/>Act 3: The nemesis tries to off the heroes and bring his plan to fruition<br/>Finale: Big fight<br/><br/>So basically the nemesis needs to be encourage to spend threat in act 3 to screw the heroes over. Preferably monologuing as he does it.<br/><br/>What do you guys think? Threat just isn't doing enough at the moment and needs to be more....threatening.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>Iain                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
