Some game will be available for free.<br/>At the moment only some sections are available:<br/>- Version 2.0 (a bit old, many great changes took place from 2006)<br/><a href="http://www.levity-rpg.net/en/?p=145" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.levity-rpg.net/en/?p=145</a><br/><br/>- RPG Sheets (to be used by teachers in classroom)<br/><a href="http://www.levity-rpg.net/en/?page_id=44" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.levity-rpg.net/en/?page_id=44</a><br/><br/>- Junior section (narration games kids-specific)<br/>"The Red and The Black", a very simple narration game for little children... <br/><a href="http://www.levity-rpg.net/en/?p=177" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.levity-rpg.net/en/?p=177</a><br/>I'm sure most of you have little kids. This game will help you to teach them the way of playing a narration game. It's very very simple (in the mechanic) but it may have interesting outcome. <br/><br/>Very soon I'll post the announcement of my new game for two players that is called "Pride and Prejudice".<br/>Cheers,<br/>Rob<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi" title="rgrassi"><img alt="rgrassi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi">rgrassi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438595/#Comment_438595" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-21T05:54:48+00:00" title="September 21, 2014  5:54AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi all, I've found the time to convert in english "Halo and Fork", a rather funny game I've used (and still using) to play with my kids and nephews (sometimes they still play it between them or with their friends).<br/><a href="http://www.levity-rpg.net/en/?p=218" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.levity-rpg.net/en/?p=218</a><br/><a href="http://www.levity-rpg.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Jun-Eng-HaloAndFork.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.levity-rpg.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Jun-Eng-HaloAndFork.pdf</a><br/>4 players, one Protagonist, one Angel, one Devil, the Conscience. <br/>The protagonist is put in front of a dilemma, the angel and the devil have a 5 words statement to drive him/her toward good or bad will, in case of tie the conscience decides...<br/>As for the other game, you shouldn't force the kids to say what is good or bad.<br/>Have fun! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>Rob<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi" title="rgrassi"><img alt="rgrassi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi">rgrassi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439301/#Comment_439301" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-10T03:25:21+00:00" title="October 10, 2014  3:25AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 10, 2014 7:51AM by rgrassi.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to publish in the next days "Nuts" another narration game for very little kids in which each player has a finite amount of nuts to be determined at the beginning of the game. The game intention is let kids learn how to handle "game economy" in terms of management of finite resources to be used to exercise authorship and narration power.<br/>In game terms the kids narrate a story focusing on two opposing characters. Whenever one player does not agree about the narration puts one (or more) nut(s) in the pot. If the other player accepts the opposition, the nuts are taken back. If, instead, opposes the narration, must play at least the "nuts played by the other player + 1". The players may raise the stakes introducing more nuts (until they have some, of course). At any time the one who started the conflict may get back from the conflict retiring the nuts from the pot. If, instead, no player wants to revert from the conflict the player who has played more nuts wins. In this case the nuts are retired from the game.<br/><br/>There are some other technicalities about "narrator switching" and things like that, but the core of the game is the one above.<br/>Any quick feedback is welcome.<br/>Thanks,<br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
