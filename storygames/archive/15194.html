The game centered around the wreck of the notorious pirate ship, the Grinning Jenny, and the players discovering the wreck and attempting to bring the pirates to justice/steal their treasure. Within the pirate crew there was a mutiny, squid god worship, and a possible alliance with Deep Ones. <br/><br/>Once the players created their characters I used a series of questions, like "Why did the fishermen decide to tell you where the Grinning Jenny had foundered" and "What relationship do you have with the Vicar and his daughter, captives of the pirates who may still be alive" to tie the players into the setting in a way that gave the players a lot of choices about motivations and goals while still focusing them on the dungeon. The questions created added drama when N's character was found to be the cousin of the vicar's daughter. <br/><br/>I set up the adventure to have two basic fronts, the mutineers who had gained control of the ship and the captain who sought to retake it. The games action focused on the players investigating the ship and the island it foundered on, and the players slow climb to the cliffside temple at the top of the island. <br/><br/>It was a highly successful game, with players picking up the rules quickly and running with them. The rules worked well to create a vibrant shared imagined space. Highlights included one characters glowing chi infused fists that punched as reach weapons, the thief's failed attempt to back-stab a guard which ended in a wild chase down a mountain path followed by pirates, and the summoning of a spiritual guide that appeared in the form of an animated Disney bluebird. The rules consistently gave the players and I space within the rules to make the story distinctly our own while providing inspiration and support. A lot has been said about how old school D&amp;D rules, by being fairly open, gave players space to imagine in a way that more rules driven systems didn't. I feel that Dungeon World recreates that feeling of freedom while usefully constraining and guiding GM behavior and layering on a fair and easy to understand rule-set. This will soon be my go to system for old school gaming.<br/><br/>Only one small problem was noted, as G and B had their wisdom highlighted and used this to sort of overtake N with experience by repeated use of discern realities.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345395/#Comment_345395" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-09T23:09:03+00:00" title="October  9, 2011 11:09PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice, Kingston.<br/><br/>How did you create the fronts?

My prep was quite detailed, with long descriptions of the fronts and threats, and lengthy area descriptions, about 5 pages single spaced typewritten and written over maybe four hours. If I had to do it over again I would have done less prep, I probably could have gotten away with one paragraph front and threat descriptions, some monster stats, a map with one sentence descriptions of notable places, and a couple of custom moves. <br/><br/>That being said, prep is a kind of fun all it's own, and DW prep advice works well, creating a dynamic, unstable environment for the players to push one way or another, rather than a mere fun house ride.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345433/#Comment_345433" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-10T12:11:28+00:00" title="October 10, 2011 12:11PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So...is that a no, then?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/KingstonC" title="KingstonC"><img alt="KingstonC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/KingstonC">KingstonC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345515/#Comment_345515" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-10T23:20:42+00:00" title="October 10, 2011 11:20PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            no, that's a yes, as soon as I can cut my five sloppy pages down to a neat and tidy two.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345531/#Comment_345531" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-11T05:49:35+00:00" title="October 11, 2011  5:49AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Boo-Ya!
