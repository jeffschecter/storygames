I just lost a longer post and don't have the energy redo it.  In short, I too miss SoK and will soon miss Paul Tevis when he finishes up.  I loved his long reviews when HGWT was in full swing.  I fear the Golden Age may be over, but there is still some good stuff out there.<br/><br/>I vastly prefer the casts that really stay on topic.  Not quite as important, but still important to me is editing.  I like the casts that take the time to snip out the things that don't contribute to the topic.  There are a couple, though, that don't edit but I still think are worth listening to, even if they would be better with editing.<br/><br/>Also, none of you mentioned the excellent Canon Puncture show, which stays pretty regular and pretty interesting.  I think <i>That's How We Roll</i> is pretty good, too, when it actually happens.  I don't suppose we'll ever see the <i>Godzilla Gaming Podcast</i> again, but I liked that one, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245973/#Comment_245973" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-09T13:17:32+00:00" title="December  9, 2009  1:17PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This shit is all just getting started.

They were my chance to listen to discussions on gaming on long flights across the ocean.  They inspired me to want to start a podcast of my own, but it was really intimidating.  What would I have to talk about?  Who would want to listen to me?<br/><br/>I started really rough, recording actual play of our Burning Empires game, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=292692892" rel="nofollow">Prometheus Chained</a> (iTunes link).  I learned how to sound edit, and the sound quality moved from awful to bearable.  The microphone was always out of the way, and mostly ignored, so it made recording easier. I published it, linked it in the <a href="http://burningwheel.org/forum/showthread.php?t=4178&amp;highlight=Prometheus+Chained" rel="nofollow">Burning Wheel Forums</a>, and I was amazed to see a few people actually listen to it! My proudest moment with that project was when Christopher Moeller, the creator of the Iron Empires Comics, <a href="http://burningwheel.org/forum/showpost.php?p=44608&amp;postcount=63" rel="nofollow">made us an Itunes cover</a> for our podcast.<br/><br/>So I now knew that I could do this.  And that if I put it out there, someone would listen to it.<br/><br/>I talked to my good friend Kyle about my dream of producing another podcast project. We had conversations about the topics we'd examine.  And then one night, we decided we'd throw caution to the wind and record.  Earlier this year, we published the first episode of <a href="http://hackit.shawwebspace.ca/" rel="nofollow">You Can Hack It</a>. We just finished Episode 8 (Which will be out on Monday), and though it's a hell of a lot of work, every time I see one of our episodes go live it's a proud, proud moment. I really love the sense of creating something and sending it out into the world. <br/><br/>I think that the first couple of Gaming Podcasts showed us this neat new way of communicating ideas.  And if you look at the proliferation of <a href="http://www.rpgpodcasts.com/" rel="nofollow">gaming podcasts</a> coming out, I think Judd is absolutely right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245992/#Comment_245992" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-09T15:56:59+00:00" title="December  9, 2009  3:56PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am a co-host on <a href="http://pulpgamer.com/outofcharacter/" rel="nofollow">Out of Character</a> and have been for almost a year.

It's more of an Innovation Age.  All the podcasts had to invent their techniques and the norms for podcasting on the fly.  This made for some awesome new stuff and whole new methods for communicating about games.  However, the initial age of something new (like podcasting) gets to a point where further innovation by the founders get more and more difficult or requires them to revamp everything they're doing.  I think Podcasting is at that point.  It's going to shift from the Innovation Age to the Growth Age where there are a wide selection of podcasts on a myriad of topics.  At some point that Growth Age will reach an equilibrium and things will go along like that for many years.  Then, at some point, people new to podcasting will look back at what the original guys did, think it's amazing, and re-revolutionize it.  That cycle will repeat several times.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246061/#Comment_246061" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-10T09:11:50+00:00" title="December 10, 2009  9:11AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 10, 2009 11:20AM by Andy.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, unfortunately my work commute is only like 10 minutes (and while I love gaming, sorry but NPR is usually more interesting), and I can't work and listen to words at the same time, so I don't listen to podcasts. I sometimes try listening on my iPod at the gym, but unfortunately they get pushed aside when I realize I can't pump iron without some beat, the words just don't cut it (also hard to concentrate when I'm counting reps). Still, I give (or gave) many podcasts a listen for 1-2 episodes to see if there's any that are awesome.<br/><br/>I liked Sons of Kryos the most, out of any podcasts, even ones I was involved in.<br/>EDIT: I totally forgot about Godzilla Gaming Podcast. I loved it for the focus, and the fact that one week they'll talk about the new hotness, the next week they'd be talking about the James Bond RPG from the 80s.<br/>I did not know that JD was a co-host of a podcast. I like what he has to say in general, so I'll be checking that one out in a bit.<br/>Ewen's podcast is very niche but I really like the topics, so I listen when I can, but I'm a few behind.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the fact that I've got a short commute and can't listen and work at the same time is a real killer for podcasts for me. For a time, when I was playing console RPGs, when I got to a "grinding moment" where I needed to spend a few hours trouncing wandering monsters for EEps, I'd lower the volume and play podcasts. But again, sometimes hard to concentrate: "Multitasking" usually means "doing two things at once, both poorly".<br/><br/>Also, if your podcast is 10 minutes long, let me know. That is a sweet spot for me in terms of Concentration, Time Commit, and Attention Span/Boredom.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246066/#Comment_246066" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-10T09:26:53+00:00" title="December 10, 2009  9:26AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob's interviews on Independent Insurgency are excellent.

That will go up now that we have snow on the ground as I have to keep the front stairs and sidewalk fasitdiously clean (competing with my neighbours; retired portuguese dudes who DO NOT PLAY when it comes to snow removal), so I have a lot of time to listen to podcasts and I devour them up.  Mainly basketball and gaming podcasts, with some OTR (especially the most awesome <a href="http://www.decoderringtheatre.com/" rel="nofollow">Decoder Ring Theatre's </a>Red Panda), Adam Carolla and Tank Riot thrown in for diversity.<br/><br/>I'm not super happy with the gaming podcasts right now.  3d6 feet still rocks (awesome talk about the industry), but I miss the glory days of early Paul Tevis when he was dropping the knowledge and less confident, Sons of Kryos of course.  What I really miss are the nice podcasts that are open-minded and go in some depth about games and gameplay.  When I say open-minded, I mean not adhering to any one agenda or group but open to gaming in general.  I loved Midnight's Lair and especially the Godzilla gaming podcast for this.  <br/><br/>I've recently added Pulp Gamer: Out of Character which can get quite interesting, but is more of an enjoyable general listen and The RPG Circus, which has good moments, but needs to pick up its energy a bit.<br/><br/>Currently, I feel like <a href="http://www.therpghaven.com/podcast/" rel="nofollow">The RPG Haven Podcast</a> (of which I am producer and co-host) is the only podcast out there that is addressing the independent game producers outside of the Forge/Storygame clique.  I have heard dozens of interviews with Vincent Baker and Luke Crane, but I'm both proud and slightly saddened to be the first person to interview Simon Washbourne, Cynthia Celeste Miller and Chris Rutkowsky, designers who are all doing very interesting things design-wise and market-wise.<br/><br/>What's getting really interesting is our Friendly Neighbourhood Gamer project, where my co-host MountZionRyan is interviewing gamers who aren't connected into the internet scene, finding out the social patterns and codes they follow in their groups.  It is much more fascinating than I had thought to hear how other people play.<br/><br/>Okay, self-pimpage over!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BastardToadflax" title="BastardToadflax"><img alt="BastardToadflax" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BastardToadflax">BastardToadflax</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246087/#Comment_246087" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-10T11:24:10+00:00" title="December 10, 2009 11:24AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Olman, you're a fellow Decoder Ring Theater fan, that's awesome!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246090/#Comment_246090" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-10T11:51:04+00:00" title="December 10, 2009 11:51AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another fan!

But I suspect that my own media production will pick back up in early 2010. I shamefully haven't put together the interview I did with John Harper back in fucking June, because of stuff like The Dresden Files RPG, conventions, Mythender, The Voice of the Revolution, etc. (Or the other four interviews I have backlogged.)<br/><br/>For the podcaster culture in general, I'm honestly excited about fewer podcasts these days, but that's because of me &amp; my interests and not because of podcasting. I could wax a bit about independent creator spheres and what happens as they grow large, shit like that, but I won't. I will say that tastes shift, people get tired of doing the same thing, and (speaking as someone who just realized today that it's his third anniversary as a podcaster) our excitement wains as time goes on. So, the "old guard" (of which I doubt I'm a part of) is looking to do different stuff, even if it's podcasting in a new way (look at Judd on CP, for example).<br/><br/>All that is to say: sure, the Golden Age of Podcasting is over, but that's also making room for a new Golden Age to begin, one that doesn't feel weirdly pressured to compete with ongoing efforts of folks like Tevis or the SoK crew or shit like that. One that'll come up with cool stuff. One that's coming up with cool stuff right now, but many of us aren't sure where to look to find that.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, you cannot hear my inflection (which is why I prefer podcasting over blogging, incidentally), but I'm intending to sound wistfully hopeful. Like, "sure, that thing you liked has come and gone. wasn't it cool? and isn't it awesome that other people are trying to find new ways to fill that void? yay!"<br/><br/>Also, this is just my damned opinion, nothing I offer as fact or truth.<br/><br/>- Ryan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

I have enjoyed catching up on the show because I can hear them mention a game each episode as it gets closer to release and then they go crazy about it when it is out (exs: Eclipse Phase and Dragon Age RPG).  I find their beginning bits of catching up with each other is my favorite part.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
