I hope I don't contradict myself too much with this.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease read this. If you're of a like mind, please contact me and I'll provide the alpha doc for my game in development, Grande Finale. I'm looking for help on filling in some gaps and seeing what gameplay is like outside of my head.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrande Finale v.103108<br/>\n Mark Causey<br/>\n<br/>\n First and foremost, this is a game for me and people like me. I've wanted a "Final Fantasy" game ever since I heard of tabletop roleplaying. I'm asking for help because of the classic reasons, but mainly because I like sharing in the creative process. I do not<br/>\nwant to make this game for everyone, not even all Final Fantasy fans who tabletop roleplay. Feel free to join up or drop out at any<br/>\ntime. There is no need to "make a commitment". If all you have is one comment, that is fine with me. All help is appreciated!<br/>\n<br/>\n Second, I feel no need to create beautiful new mechanics to change the way everyone games. It is already pretty traditional with some indie or story gaming influences. I will probably respond to ideas founded on a whole new way of doing things as a request for permission to design your own game. Sorry if that hurts, but I have a big desire to see a playable version done as soon as possible and not be caught in self-revisionist hell. That said, ideas are welcome. I've borrowed from quite a few sources already. I don't mind this being a hodge-podge game.<br/>\n<br/>\n *Console Gaming*<br/>\n I've seen quite a few posts and essays on console gaming. I know that part of the problem of emulating this type of game is that there are many elements in these games that people find interesting and fun and that not everyone shares the same elements in kind or the same perspective on these elements.<br/>\n<br/>\n     /Classes/ - I love the classes in the Final Fantasy series. Dragoons, Gamblers, Dark Knights, Summoners and others all appeal to me and I love most every variation on them.<br/>\n<br/>\n     /Clashes with Evil Kingdoms and Love Stories/ - I throw out my internal critic when the story moves to grandiose war stories and heartwarming love stories. They make each game feel that much more accessible when you know the cliches. Whether you're retelling the story on the table top or replaying the video game, you get this sense of engaging in a myth with many variations.<br/>\n<br/>\n     /Action Battle Systems/ - When it comes down to the most visceral, casting those big spells or wielding those fantastic weapons makes my heart race sometimes. Mountain shaking monsters and sky darkening fleets of airships are the enemies you play to fight again and again.<br/>\n<br/>\n     /Airships and Moogles/ - The minute details of any given Final Fantasy world usually delight or annoy most players. I don't want to force Moogles on my games and I don't want those kinds of elements even firmly outlined. Because, damn, which FF would you choose *your* Moogle from? Or your Chocobo? But, a reminder to find a way to include your favorite minutia is necessary and integral to a successful game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176874/#Comment_176874" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-31T10:00:18+00:00" title="October 31, 2008 10:00AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to hear more about how you want to capture an "Action Battle System" feel in your game.

You target the important characteristics. For instance, you wouldn't attack a 1) swordswoman, 2) a nest of vampire spiders, or 3) a burning city. You might target:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) the swordswoman's weapon skill (difficult, but worth it in the long run) or her pride (easier, but you might see her start to defend her pride directly with other characteristics).<br/>\n<br/>\n2) the vampire spiders' need for blood or their captured prisoners. You wouldn't attack the prisoners, you see, but you'd attack the spiders' attachment to their prisoners. You might not have to defeat the spiders totally to save those prisoners, but you can bet they'll defend that as much as they'd defend their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) the burning city's engulfed hospice or its desire to ruin the airship factory. You could "convince" the fire to not burn down the factory.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's neat about all of this to me is that these same characteristics are what the swordswoman, the spiders, and the fire would use to target you as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other point is that you'll look at both successful dice and unsuccessful dice in each roll as a cue to describe both successes and failures, but all the while you'll know how close you are to defeating someone because you'll be tearing down their characteristics which will always be visible in terms of their remaining power.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176973/#Comment_176973" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-01T09:53:43+00:00" title="November  1, 2008  9:53AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I'm not a Final Fantasy fan but I am a big fan of those fringe games loosely tied to the Final Fantasy series, like the Final Fantasy Legend/Romancing SaGa/SaGa Frontier series.

ABS is not solely for combats, but is for any intense scene. Minigame is for light scenes. They both should really be able to resolve situations and should be used when thematically appropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm currently working on ABS. Here is the basic concept, so you don't have to research:<br/>\n<br/>\nLet's say you and I are in a classic battle scene. We get the deck of cards in front of us. I'm red and you're black and I go first.<br/>\n<br/>\nI describe what is going on. I have about a sentence worth of action to narrate. I then draw a card.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it is red, I get to continue on. If it is black, you get to start describing things. Whomever has narration has the temporary advantage in the scene and describes accordingly. Hopefully this rapid back and forth will be fun, representing the swords clashing and spells flying in a crazy cool fashion.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we've drawn five cards, we see who had the most cards that matched our color. The "winner" dishes out some damage to the "loser", in the form of a reduced Aspect and a trauma Aspect added at the same value. Aspects are used differently in Minigame, where their value actually affects cards drawn. In this situation, they're basically hit points. There are three core Characteristics, that, if depleted, will knock a character out. These core Characteristics become available to attack when they have no Aspects to defend them (Aspects are tied to the core Characteristics).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I want the players to be able to say, "This conflict matters to me" in a way much more powerful than fighting over it. But, at its core, the ABS mechanic doesn't allow for it. Even if I have some rules about holding cards up your sleeve, you can win the battle but not he war. I want a player to be able to make a sacrifice that makes a major statement and could, when used properly, win the battle and the war.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm thinking that a player could be able to "sacrifice" an Aspect to attack with more power than normal - maybe when they've won a five card volley they could sacrifice their attacking Aspect to use its full power, hopefully breaking through the defending Aspect on the other character. This would deplete this arena for them for the battle, and force them to change it after the scene in some way. Kind of like buying off a Key in TSOY.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177268/#Comment_177268" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-04T07:39:33+00:00" title="November  4, 2008  7:39AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems like you'd benefit from having a range of limit break options that segue into permanent advantage that lasts for the whole conflict. Do the characters have some sort of flags that explicitly tell us what matters to them? If they do, you could just say that when a conflict pokes a flag of theirs, they can go into limit break on any lost hand, which then allows them some crazy powers for the rest of the conflict. For added crunch, give different powers for different flags if you want, so that somebody fighting for their own life gets different benefits from somebody defending their love.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177270/#Comment_177270" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-04T07:53:46+00:00" title="November  4, 2008  7:53AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 4, 2008 7:59AM by Mark_Causey.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would you make a Limit Break be part of a Broken (currently depleted) Aspect?
