I thought the Monologue of Victory gave players free range to take over the narrative as long as they avoided violating the 3 rules given in the text:\n<blockquote>"You can do just about anything. In fact, these are the only real limitations you must observe:<br/><br/>1) Don\u2019t make alterations to the characters of other players (such as killing them). You can add complications for them and affect the things around them, but don\u2019t intrude on the creation of a fellow player. <br/>2) Keep your narration in synch with the established facts and tone of the game. If you need to ask the GM questions or prompt the other players for responses during your MOV, do so.<br/>3) Keep your narration reasonably short."</blockquote>\nThe GM however, thought that the MOV gave the player much less creative license when narrating the Monologue of Victory. It seemed as though he didn't want it to change the nature of the story or the NPCs in too meaningful of a way. The GM is more used to the way traditional RPGs work, so this may have effected his reading of the rules. Also, it seemes as though the GM had written all the players, the locations, and the structure of the adventure beforehand (their likely wasn't much room for improvisation), and if the narrative strayed too much it might mess up what he had planned, which understandably may have made him less eager to go with my interpretation of the rules.<br/><br/>So my first question regarding The Pool is what do you think the creative limits of the Monologue of Victory are? <br/><br/>My second question has to do with the difference between what The Pool calls "rolling the dice to take action" and "conflicts." The Poll explains it like this:\n<blockquote><br/>"Dice are cast to determine the general outcome of conflicts. This is not the same as rolling when you simply want to take an action. The swing of a sword can be achieved through simple dialogue with the GM, without throwing dice. The effect of a die roll in The Pool is much broader than the swing of a sword.<br/>Anyone can call for a die roll whenever a conflict is apparent or when someone wants to introduce a new conflict. Just broadly state your intention and roll."</blockquote>\nCan someone explain and give some examples of what the difference between "rolling the dice to take action" and a "conflict" is? Should the quote above be read to mean that swinging a sword at an enemy is no a "conflict." Is The Pool novel and different from most other RPGs when it comes to what should constitute a role and what shouldn't?<br/><br/>Finally, in the text of The Pool it gives this example of a character deciding to roll dice:\n<blockquote>"Damart is in an ancient library. I want him to find a piece of knowledge that will help him on his quest, <br/>so I ask for a roll..."</blockquote>\nIn this situation is the player's role determining whether there will be a piece of knowledge in the library to help him on his quest or is this simply an attempt to see if there is and whether there is a piece of knowledge has already been determined by the GM? My reading is that if that if the player is successful they can narrate finding this piece of knowledge in their MOV, and if the player fails or  decides to forgo their MOV the GM could narrate the outcome however they like...am I reading this correctly? Also, how would "wanting a piece of knowledge" be considered a conflict? This seems like an example of a character trying to change the outcome of the narrative not a conflict...what am I missing? <br/><br/>Any info or advice is very appreciated <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Thanks <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458674/#Comment_458674" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-12T07:01:34+00:00" title="December 12, 2016  7:01AM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 12, 2016 7:14AM by Paul_T.">edited December 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeff,<br/><br/>Sure. <br/><br/><i>The Pool</i> is an old and very "bare bones" document. There isn't a whole lot in the text to draw upon, and therefore much of the specifics are up to the particular group playing the game. The players should see the dice and rules as tools to negotiate roleplaying together, and use them in the fashion which seems most fun to them.<br/><br/>Having said that, here are my answers (in a different order):<br/><br/>2. The passage you quoted is explaining that you roll the dice to resolve conflicts, not to "take action" (as in the example of swinging a sword). It's trying to tell the reader that it isn't a simple "task resolution" game, where dice are rolled to see how well a character carries out an action.<br/><br/>The point here is to realize that the intent of the die roll in <i>The Pool</i> is to resolve  a significant conflict. There should be a clear goal, some kind of opposition, and a clear sense for everyone at the table of what's at stake. <br/><br/>Perhaps two characters come to blows over a bag of gold. What's at stake? Who ends up with the bag. There's also some fighting going on, which colours the action (it would be awkward to narrate, for instance, the two characters pausing their fight and deciding to play cards, instead). There is something at stake and an arena of conflict.<br/><br/>1. This helps understand the purpose of the "MoV" rules. They tell you that the player becomes empowered to narrate as much as is necessary to resolve the current conflict.<br/><br/>For instance, if the player won the roll in the example above, they could narrate overcoming their foe with ease, collapsing the roof on them, and leaving with the gold.<br/><br/>But they could also narrate losing the fight, ending up bleeding and defeated, with the enemy leaving unharmed... but revealing that they had switched the bag much earlier - their enemy left with a decoy, and the character actually has the real gold.<br/><br/>In both cases, the conflict is clearly resolved, with the gold ending up with the winner, and the arena of conflict was respected (albeit less so in the second example).<br/><br/>Just like a GM does after a roll in a traditional RPG, the player is now taking on the creative responsibility of narrating what that roll represents in the fiction. They have the same powers and the same (unwritten) constraints as a GM does when I say, "Oh, no! I missed my roll to pick the lock. What happens?"<br/><br/>In the rules as written, the creative limits give that player all kinds of rights: to, for example, change the personality of the NPC (their foe) through a change of heart or to have them reveal a secret.<br/><br/>Are you going to play it that way? It's up to you.<br/><br/>In practice, here's what matters:<br/><br/>A. <b>The narration focuses on the resolution of the conflict, and then stops</b>. (Much like how a GM in a traditional RPG looks at the outcome of a roll and tells the group what just happened.) <br/><br/>This is why MoV's don't have a "word limit". You can spend 10 minutes describing how you look into your enemy's face before you pull the trigger, no problem. But don't suddenly start framing a whole other scene - your job is simply to describe the outcome of the die roll.<br/><br/>B. <b>The narration respects the outcome of the dice</b> (not strictly necessary, but the game tends to be much better this way). We're rolling to establish a winner and a loser; not just to switch around who's talking just now. (Admittedly less important than my other points here, and not necessarily supported by the text, but some people lose sight of this point, whereas in fact it's very helpful for getting everyone on the same page for point A. You can see how ignoring this idea - for example, narrating a loss, makes it very hard to follow the directions in A. What is your job? We don't know. So I recommend you treat the die roll as a clear success or failure, a victory or loss.)<br/><br/>C. <b>The group comes to the table with the expectation of creating an evolving and dynamic story together</b>. If someone has specific outcomes in mind (like a predetermined plot), the rules will work against you. <b>The players should all (including the GM) be *looking forward* to discovering, through the oracle of the dice and the input of the participants, what happens next.</b> <i>The Pool</i> is not a game which is going to play smoothly if someone wants to force their story direction down the others' throats... (at least without clearly communicating that intention earlier; see point D).<br/><br/>D. The <b>specifics of what's up for grabs</b>, in terms of narrating incidental detail (other than that strictly necessary to resolve the conflict at hand) and what isn't is... that's not covered by the rudimentary rules text, and the players need to be prepared to negotiate this to achieve the kind of game they want.<br/><br/>Do we want to play a game where each participant gets full, creative input, at any point that's mandated by the dice? For example, if I'm in a fight with a masked stranger, can I narrate how I pull off their mask and then reveal their identity as I wish? ("Look! It's the baker's mother!") The rules are silent here; we must be ready to have a frank discussion about it. <br/><br/>I would argue that the default position of the rules is "yes". However, it's possible not to play the game this way. We can have a more traditional GM-role even within MoV's, by all <i>agreeing</i> to play the game this way. But it can only happen if everyone is on the same page about that expectation, and is gracious towards the other players.<br/><br/>Consider:<br/><br/>If I lose a die roll against my opponent, does that give the GM the authority to describe my character as a bumbling idiot? In some groups and some games, yes, it does. In others, that would be a <i>faux pas</i>. Why? Because we are negotiating whether the player's portrayal of their character is solely theirs or up for grabs. This is something we <b>need</b> to agree on; we can't afford to be fighting about it in the middle of the game each time it comes up.<br/><br/>The same goes for backstory detail like the identity of the masked stranger. When I win that roll, and pull of his mask, can I say who he is? Well, if the point of the game is free-wheeling collaborative story creation, then absolutely. But if the idea is to interact with the GM's prep, in a more traditional fashion, then I exercise restraint, and I narrate how my character defeats the foe and tears off his mask... and then hand narration back to the GM.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458675/#Comment_458675" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-12T07:12:26+00:00" title="December 12, 2016  7:12AM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>You can see, hopefully, how this is purely a matter of social grace, not game-vetted narrative power. It's exactly the same in these two example cases:<br/><br/>* As the GM, I might agree (whether tacitly or overtly) not to portray your character in ways which clash with your vision of the character. If I don't know, I can ask. ("Hey, looks like your character loses the chess game at this point. Why is that, do you think? Does she make a dumb move? Is she distracted by something at an unfortunate moment? Or is she simply unable to match the skills of her opponent? Is her opponent cheating?")<br/><br/>Why is this? It's because I've come to the table with a curiosity - an interest - in seeing <i>how you will portray your protagonist</i>. I don't *want* to take that away from you; I want to see it in action.<br/><br/>* As a player, I might - in the same way - agree, whether tacitly or overtly, not to portray an NPC or reveal their secrets in a way which clashes with your vision of the backstory or dramatic events of the game. If I don't know, I can ask. ("Ok! I hold him at swordpoint and tear off his mask! Whom do I see? Is it Benedict, by any chance? I hope it is!") <br/><br/>Why is this?  It's because I've come to the table with a curiosity - an interest - in seeing what secrets or dramatic events you have come up with. I don't *want* to take that away from you; I want to see it in action, and to discover it as I play.<br/><br/>It's exactly the same, in both cases. The rules won't do it for you here; you need social agreement (or on-the-spot negotiation*) to resolve it for you.<br/><br/><br/>*: Nothing wrong with speaking up "in the moment" and saying so: "Hey, I dig what you're going for, but I don't see my character as someone who would lose a chess match because a good-looking guy just walked by. Can we do over?" Similarly, as the GM, I might say, "Ooh! Hang on! You rip his mask off? Cool, I've been looking forward to revealing his identity. Is it OK if we end your Monologue here, or do you want to add some other details before I do so?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458676/#Comment_458676" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-12T07:21:56+00:00" title="December 12, 2016  7:21AM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A shorter and potentially more useful answer:\n<blockquote>[...] the GM had written all the players, the locations, and the structure of the adventure beforehand (there likely wasn't much room for improvisation), and if the narrative strayed too much it might mess up what he had planned</blockquote>\nThis <b>does not</b> work with a game like <i>The Pool</i>.

One of the GMs great attributes is how throughly and how much effort he puts into planning his sessions; of course, this can be problematic for games that work better with some amount of improvisation. I think we just both came to the game expecting two very different games. We are playing the second session tomorrow and hopefully it will go well. I really think The Pool would shine if played with more shared creative control; although, not to the point of taking players completely away from characters and the world and NPCs completely away from the GM. It's interesting how two people with different backgrounds and tastes in RPGs can interpret the same rule set so differently <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Anyway, thanks for the feedback :-)                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458694/#Comment_458694" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-13T05:21:49+00:00" title="December 13, 2016  5:21AM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I should add that it's my opinion that your reading of the rules is the one which is best supported by the text.

But I do remember that once... We were playing TMW in Italian and somebody had home-translated the various Dark Fates and printed them out as a deck of cards. I was GMing and I hadn't double-checked those translations myself. The game fell quite flat. There was one PC who gave out some obvious hints of dark power and I was expecting him to be positioning to backstab his companions, but this never happened. At last, this one PC was one of those who managed to kill the Witch in a fight. I was expecting Dark Fates to kick in during that fight, but no such thing happened - I was left in charge. Debriefing the game, I asked that particular player: "Weren't you the Witch's son or something? I'm surprised you didn't take the lead when you confronted him directly." And he was like: "What? <i>The Witch</i>'s son? I thought it said here I was <i>a witch</i>'s child - some <i>other</i> witch!"<br/>The problem was, of course, with the translation: too vague a wording and the player didn't get that the <i>point</i> of his Dark Fate was to put him at odds with his companions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
