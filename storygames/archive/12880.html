Parasite is also a custom map for the recently released rts Starcraft 2.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's one of those things I just stumbled across kicking around online. Starcraft 2 has an incredibly powerful map editing tool, and people have used it to create all sorts of shit: side-scrollers, tetris clones, racing games, first person shooters, you name it. Parasite is a custom map that implements a classic survival horror scenario: you're the civillian crew of a mining outpost, and one of you has been infected with a deadly alien parasite, but you don't know who.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you spawn as a human, your goal is to survive until you kill the parasite. If you spawn as the parasite or become infected, your goal is to infect or kill every human.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe details of the scenario are pretty brilliant, in that tropey survival horror behavior seems to emerge from them naturally. You get people running through the dark station being chased by aliens frantically screaming out over chat for help, and everyone's afraid to come to their aid because how do they know the person asking for help isn't the parasite attempting to lure them to some secluded corner? You get people deciding that the only way to be sure the parasite is gone is to launch in a shuttle and shoot the space station down, and you get those guys being ganked by the humans who would be left behind on the station to die with the parasite. It's creepy, it evokes a real sense of tension and seclusion, and, I think, it's the first real story game that's purely defined by a computer implementation.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone else played this game?<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone seen anything like it?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are ways that Parasite takes advantage of its medium to accomplish things that would just be impossible in a tabletop game. For instance, the flow of information is naturally very different, and that's a big part of how Parasite creates its atmosphere. What are other things that we could do with computer story games that we couldn't do with tabletop ones?<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought of SG immediately after tripping over this little gem; I hope those of you who have bought sc2 check it out!<br/>\n<br/>\nJeff                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289936/#Comment_289936" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T12:16:40+00:00" title="August 30, 2010 12:16PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, weird thing: I have SC2.
