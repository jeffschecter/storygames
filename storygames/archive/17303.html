I would recommend, though, to number the scenes from 1 to 5, so you may trigger deaths by rising in numbers. Then only those with a 6 may survive. And all would know that, exept themselves. I believe that would make a nice difference to the game.</blockquote>\nThat was what I was trying to communicate. I see how the two rolls (which have nothing to do with one another) might be confusing. This might be a case where giving a label to the numbers (Destiny numer, Enemy roll, Scene number) will make the text more clear.<br/><br/>Another game:<br/><br/><b>Quantum Web of Truths and Lies</b><br/>You need to be more than two players.<br/><br/>You play as agents who meet in a dark alley to exchange information. The enemy is all around you but you are safe for now.<br/><br/>Each player writes a hidden note that either says "Loyal" or "Traitor".<br/><br/>The agents can ask each other questions or deliver information. If someone disputes that information with counter-information<br/>the agent writes a note stating wether it was true or not and shows it to the accusing player (and only the accusing player).<br/><br/>Example: <br/>Agent Red: General Vappa left for the southern front this morning.<br/>Agent Purple: No he did not, I saw him at the banquet tonight.<br/>(Agent Red writes a note saying "I speak truth")<br/><br/>All agents write down information they think is useful and wether they think it is true or not. The goal of the loyal agents is<br/>to bring with them more true than untrue information and vise versa for the traitor agents. Any agent can at any time pull out<br/>a weapon and kill one (and only one) other agent before the other agents have time to act.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes" title="Snake_Eyes"><img alt="Snake_Eyes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes">Snake_Eyes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403134/#Comment_403134" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-08T22:34:41+00:00" title="January  8, 2013 10:34PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 9, 2013 12:21AM by Snake_Eyes.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ((Apologies to Krippler, I just stole your idea.
