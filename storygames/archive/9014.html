For something like the Key of Love, that's pretty obvious. But others are more vague. For example, if you have the Key of the Impostor, it could be read as "I'm really into impersonating others", or it could mean, "my character is pretending to be the Duke of Windsor", in which case the Key will be bought off when the character reveals her real identity.<br/><br/>My question is:<br/><br/>How strictly is it best to hew to the subject specified? <br/><br/>Key of the Impostor seems more fun if you let it apply to many different disguises. But what about:<br/><br/>* Key of the Revolutionary -- against a specific regime, or whoever's in power?<br/><br/>* Key of Curiosity -- the text says "the subject", but should it apply to any actions driven by curiosity, or just those relevant to that subject?<br/><br/>* Key of the Vow -- Can you make many vows, and use the Key to apply to them all, or would you have to buy several copies of the Key?<br/><br/>* Key of the Competitor -- Are you a competitive person in general, or is this about a specific rival? (This one's text specifies to "choose a particular person, social group, culture, or species.)<br/><br/>In my game, a player took the Key of the Rebel, to show him speaking out against his family (he's sort of an angsty teenager sort). I thought it was about his family, but it turns out he thought it means his character is allergic to any kind of strict authority.<br/><br/>This seems like less of a rule issue and more of a "what's more fun" issue. I'm generally inclined to go with whatever the player's interpretation seems to be.<br/><br/>Anyone with more TSoY experience have some advice on this point?<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199203/#Comment_199203" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-28T10:32:34+00:00" title="March 28, 2009 10:32AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>* Key of the Revolutionary -- against a specific regime, or whoever's in power?<br/></blockquote>\n"What are you rebelling against young lady?" <br/><br/>"Wadd'ya got?" <br/><br/>GASP!<br/><br/><br/>My answer to this is going to be a version of "whatever works" but I'll try to make it one that isn't completely useless in its openness. <br/><br/>Part of it depends on what sort of game you're playing. If you're playing a tightly focused game with a well constructed situation, then the more Keys tie directly to that situation, the happier you're going to be. If you have, for example, an intergalactic empire of evil going around burning farms in order to catch droids, then the more PCs have keys directly pointed at the empire: rebelling against the empire, curious about the magical knights of old, a vow to make right a wrong you once did to a student who has now turned to evil.... well, that's where your situation is going to turn into a story, right? <br/><br/>OTOH, if you're going to be playing a picaresque game where situations are going to change from episode to episode and its something of the nature of the characters in general rather than specific that's going to be the ongoing highlight of the show (see: Conan) then having keys that are personally tuned but less specifically situational is probably better. A key of the barbarian that acts like a key of rebellion against the dictates of civilization, a key of curiosity that always has you poking your nose in places that kill cats, a guy that's so competitive that he'll get into a fight with anyone, no matter where he happens to be this week... well, those are what's going to make the story work, right? <br/><br/>So like your player with the key of the rebel -- what are you looking to do in the game with it? What is he? Do you want a story specifically about family and his family and the interactions of family power, or do you want a more open story where he gets to show where the limits of his character's rebellion are by which authority he choses to buck and which he choses to accept?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199205/#Comment_199205" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-28T11:22:56+00:00" title="March 28, 2009 11:22AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My advice is simply to make directed Keys as specific as possible.  Achieving the objective or changing the paradigm just means burning the Key, and that's totally good.  Rebel against this.  Love him.  Impersonate that.  Swear to always do this.  <br/><br/>Curiosity we've always played as general, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199220/#Comment_199220" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-28T16:51:18+00:00" title="March 28, 2009  4:51PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul,<br/>\n  Generally, I try and nail those down.
