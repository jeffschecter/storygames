A lot of the time it seems really natural for the Master to have the minions kill off their connections, but this seems to put a huge amount of influence over the game into the hands of the Master, if all the Love dies with them.  On the other hand, having connections safe from harm is kinda weaksauce.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134826/#Comment_134826" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T07:40:31+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  7:40AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the minions always have the option to try to resist, but I wouldn't advise doing it <i>systematically</i>.  The Master may be able to prevent Endgame by continually killing off the connection with the most love, but even then the minions each get a scene request for each on the Master gets, so they should be able to gang up on him and do overture after overture.  Eventually somebody should get enough Love to kill the bastard.<br/><br/>Overall, killing a Connection is likely to extend the game, since it reduces the total amount of love possessed by the minions.  That is especially true if you're deliberately hitting the Connection and the Minion with the most Love.  If you command a Minion to kill one of his own Connections, he's likely to resist regardless of whether he can start Endgame.  Keep that in mind - if you do this when the Minion has enough Love, you are just <i>asking</i> for Endgame.  Also, remember that the Minion may simply fail the Violence roll to kill the Connection.<br/><br/>You can also send Minions after one-another's Connections, instead of their own.  They're less likely to resist that way.  Or you can command them to <i>kidnap</i> rather than kill, which can provide great grist for the Nar mill.  What's a better overture than a Minion weeping as he chains his best friend into the Master's torture device?<br/><br/>Commands are your way of injecting into the game whatever you feel it needs.  Pathos?  Drama?  Horror?  They're all yours for the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">asking</span> commanding.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134827/#Comment_134827" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T07:43:12+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  7:43AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey JC,<br/><br/>You should follow the advice of <a href="http://www.chimera.info/daedalus/articles/spring2005/mlwm-manifesto.html" rel="nofollow">the Master</a> when it comes to playing the Master in MLwM.<br/><br/>cheers!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134901/#Comment_134901" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T11:46:03+00:00" title="March 14, 2008 11:46AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love that article. <br/><br/>Remember, the point is not to kill Love, but to crush the characters. If you just kill off their connections, then they just wallow. You do not want them to wallow, you want them to be crushed. And that you can only do by slowly and painfully torturing them with the knowledge that you will eventually destroy their connections. Simply killing them is bourgeois fatuousness, and that the master must never be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
