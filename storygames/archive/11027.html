Not only that, but it's often fiercely nationalist, race-targeted, and gender segregated. Further, the site linked is clearly targeted at white males of a "professional" age and class, and seems to imply that they are the pinnacle of "grownup", and thus maturity and wealth.<br/><br/>It's like society can be at its worst when fashion comes to the forefront of conversation, hey?<br/><br/>We can acknowledge that while simultaneously acknowledging that being conscientious about how you dress, and caring about your own fashion, and caring about the world of fashion... is fine. Some people really enjoy it, and they like turning themselves into art, and they think fashion is how that happens. Some people like to dress for a specific purpose, or a specific image, and both of those things are also fine.<br/><br/>So, like... A (the fashion industry has negatives) doesn't need to dominate B (fashion can be fun to think about). And more importantly, A doesn't even need to show up in a conversation about B.<br/><br/>I say this because I feel like you're attacking "fashion" itself, and in doing so are attacking those who enjoy thinking about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244482/#Comment_244482" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-01T17:31:19+00:00" title="December  1, 2009  5:31PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh boy do I feel like a nerd now.

I mean, I used to game with some computer programmers who would spend hundreds of dollars on a wardrobe of black t-shirts with "witty" sayings (though still wear the same ratty jeans all the time). For the same amount of money, they could have bought a decent wardrobe.<br/><br/>To answer droog: dude, shopping in goodwill is quite fashionable. I went to a going-out-of-business secondhand store with some friends and saw my boyfriend pick up a half-dozen skinny ties and a gorgeous vintage leather blazer (!) for $7. Yes, seven dollars.<br/><br/>I don't understand it. I think there's some kind of cultural signifier in being poorly dressed. Now that I think of it, I also know nerds who would never spend money on clothing, but will spend $500 on a pair of geek-chic designer frames for their glasses. Because glasses -&gt; intelligence -&gt; nerd. But clothes that fit, coordinate, and are clean and pressed -&gt; that guy who used to shove nerds in his locker and date the hot girls?

I haven't ever thought about it as a nerd thing, but I am pretty fashion-hostile. I can rationalize it as well, and in ways that I don't think have anything to do with nerds in specific. To wit: fashion is superficial, while my life is spent in deep thought and striving for excellence with the substantial pursuits of truth, beauty and goodness. Fashion is just one of the shallow things people use to distract themselves from the meaningful things of life, so I don't have time for it. Consequently my clothing is exactly whatever happens to be on hand, no more and no less.<br/><br/>Now, considering a rationalization like that, if anybody chooses to ascribe my attitude to "nerdiness", what can I say? That's not a self-selected label, that's just somebody else categorizing me. I don't even really understand the whole nerd thing as a subculture, we didn't have anything like that where I grew up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244496/#Comment_244496" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-01T18:33:44+00:00" title="December  1, 2009  6:33PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am hyperaware of how I dress when I'm at nerd events, like conventions and meetups and such.

I can't discern any overarching aesthetic message to the items it features, any style that unites those items, or for that matter anything in the way of useful advice for someone who wanders in there and wants to know more about "dressing well."  So I've got no problem with people mocking that blog specifically -- it seems to be intensely useless to anyone who isn't the guy running it.<br/><br/>That said, I understand that "dressing well" is an invaluable social skill that frequently becomes an artform in its own right.  I know that there are places in this world where I will go and people will really and truly give a shit about what my wristwatch looks like or how expensive my shoes are, for good or for ill.  I know that there are other situations in which "dressing appropriately" will pay off a thousand times over.  I also suspect that there are some types of clothing that I would absolutely look good in (although finding those ensembles has always been hit-or-miss for me), just as there are some outfits I will never be able to wear without looking like a jackass (or worse, feeling like one).  I know that I can use clothing to easily fit myself into a social group and be accepted, or to set myself apart from it and send other messages instead.<br/><br/>I also know that, as a guy, I'm lucky that -- as complicated as fashion is and as significant an impact as it has on my everyday life -- I'm playing in the minor leagues, here.  Seriously: women have been eyeball-deep in this for centuries, whether they wanted to be or not.  The kinds of fashion choices and options and external judgments I deal with are nothing -- fucking <i>nothing</i> -- compared to the labyrinth they have to negotiate, starting almost from the moment that they become capable of dressing themselves.  (And yes, I do cringe at the thought of men's fashion ever becoming as...well, as <i>fashionable</i> as women's; not because I think it's an assault on my masculinity or my group affiliations, but because I'm just plain scared of that much complexity.  I don't have the tools or the training for that system, and if there's any possible way I can avoid ever having to engage with it on any level other than the dumbed-down one I'm currently part of, halle-fucking-lujah.)<br/><br/>And so if there was a source for men's fashion information that addressed both my needs (i.e., tell me why some things look good and others don't, tell me what my clothing choices mean in a larger context, tell me how I can dress appropriately for situations without bankrupting myself, etc.) and my fears (reassure me that changing my wardrobe does not mean I am stepping into a morass of high-level social games that I cannot play effectively or entertainingly), by god, I'd read it.  But putthison.com clearly ain't that.  I don't know what it is -- maybe just the author's "Oh, I think this looks cool" aggregator -- but it's definitely not a useful general fashion blog by any stretch of the imagination.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244509/#Comment_244509" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-01T19:22:59+00:00" title="December  1, 2009  7:22PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eh. I don't know. Fashion is superficial in the way that all art is superficial. It's about beauty, which many people will tell you is superficial and not meaning enough to bother with. But for a lot of people, me included, finding beauty in everything is important, as is making a statement-- which fashion is an excellent medium for doing (And not just in a "My other car is the death star" kind of a way).<br/><br/>I do object to the idea that fashion is about following rich, beautiful role-models. I mean, there are plenty of Trendy Wendys who are all about the next big thing. But where do you think the next big thing comes from? Do you think there's a big committee room somewhere where Heidi Klum and Nina Garcia hold court over a bunch of butt-kissers and decide lime is the new burnt umber? Please. True surprise and innovation in fashion comes from outside influences. Fashion-the-industry watches the street. Fashion-the-concept is about a personal point of view that is visually arresting and communicates something to the people who see it. <br/><br/>Some people don't know how to talk about fashion, the same way some people don't know how to talk about wine or art or game design or whatever else that can be summed up with "I don't know [blank], but I know what I like." I saw this with my ex-husband who went from living in hawaiian shirts and hot topic closeouts to shopping at the Armani Exchange and checking the seams on everything he tried on. (Trying clothes on! Can you believe it?) He knew the kind of message he wanted to give, but he didn't know how to get there. There was a big lightbulb that went off one day when he said, "You know, I think shirts with words are doing me more harm than good." Blogs with specific advice-- that advertise clothes <i>you may not like</i> but explain <i>what is good about those clothes</i>-- help you figure out how to talk about what you like as well as what you don't like, and introduce you to fundamental concepts that you can riff off of.<br/><br/>I just bought the <a href="http://www.chow.com/stories/10438" rel="nofollow">Alinea restaurant</a> cookbook. Do I plan on getting a crapton of molecular gastronomy food additives, black truffles and custom servicewear and making stuff like granola in a rosewater envelope for dinner? Of course not.

That's crap masquerading as fashion.<br/><br/>The thing is, this actually takes a bit of effort. It's easy to buy "fashionable" clothes that make you look terrible and feel awful to wear. I bought some damn "relaxed fit" jeans because I want to look relaxed. Instead I look really tense because I'm afraid my jeans will fall down and show my underwear. That's my bad for not thinking through my fashion purchase. I can't wait till these damn things wear out.<br/><br/>So yes, dress like a grown up; that's my New Year's Resolution; but not Put This On style, because I don't like the stuff on their blog.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244514/#Comment_244514" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-01T19:27:16+00:00" title="December  1, 2009  7:27PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 1, 2009 7:29PM by Elizabeth.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite><br/>And so if there was a source for men's fashion information that addressed both my needs (i.e., tell me why some things look good and others don't, tell me what my clothing choices mean in a larger context, tell me how I can dress appropriately for situations without bankrupting myself, etc.) and my fears (reassure me that changing my wardrobe does not mean I am stepping into a morass of high-level social games that I cannot play effectively or entertainingly), by god, I'd read it.

I'm even in favor of the <a href="http://zigguratbuilder.livejournal.com/146712.html" rel="nofollow"><b>nexus that lies between gaming and real design/fashion</b></a>. And I hate this site.<br/><br/>This "Put This On" blog *sucks*. <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Suuuuuuuuuuuccccckkkkkkkks</span></b>. It's nothing but white male yuppie zilch fashion bullshit. Every piece of fashion there (exceptions noted 2 paragraphs below) looks like it crawled out of a British garden party of the late 60s/early 70s. The shoes, the coats, the shirts, the slacks, the <b>BOWTIES</b> (!!!), all of it. If I had a time machine and wanted to score with genteel willowy upper-class Brits in the late 60s, I'd check this blog regularly. But otherwise, it's total trash.<br/><br/>Now, I went back about 8 pages' worth of "Older Posts" to come to that determination, it wasn't one or two pics that got me in an uproar. I was horrified right off the bat by the front page, but going back further and further confirmed it: A site that tells me to <a href="http://www.landsend.com/pp/TailoredFitPaintbrushShirt~195523_59.html?bcc=y&amp;action=order_more&amp;sku_0=::HGK&amp;CM_MERCH=SRCH_00001&amp;origin=search" rel="nofollow">put THIS bullshit on</a>, and I'm not a lumberjack, needs to be resoundly mocked. <br/><br/>However, I'm not against the message. In fact, About one in every of their 15-20 blog posts they Get It Right. Usually a post on tuxedos or someshit. But everything else should be flushed away.<br/><br/>When I go looking for fashion, I basically start busting open some copies of MONO (unfortunately there's few such fashion/item/lifestyle magazines for men). Like here:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.monomaga.net/mono/shop/top.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.monomaga.net/mono/shop/top.aspx</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.monomagazine.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.monomagazine.com/</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.monomaga.net/mono/shop/category_list.aspx?CD=C0011179" rel="nofollow">MONO's online store</a><br/><br/>Now, when I go to game conventions and the like, I usually dress up in my <b>Novyi Russkiy</b> best: <a href="http://www.tradenote.net/images/users/000/046/455/products_images/Thick_Heavy_Weight_Matching_Hip_Hop_Style_Track_Suit.jpg" rel="nofollow">Cheap matching trainer pants and blazer/hoodie</a>, sunglasses, expensive shoes. I keep it relaxed more than pimpin. <br/><br/>But my average day style? Most days at work I look like I crawled out of a <a href="http://www.tommybahama.com/TBG/Men/Shirts.jsp" rel="nofollow">Tommy Bahama</a> catalog: Solid Hawaiian shirt, cargo pants, dockers or Merells. <br/>At home, I favor urbanwear, baggy hoodies and the like. <br/>I don't do "Business Casual". It's a fucking trap of blandness, with bizarre rules and non-rules depending on where you work, what you do. On jobs, I either go business-and-casual (above Hawaiian shirts and sometimes dressier pants), or dive straight into clean pressed slacks, ties, sportcoat, and hell even a suit vest if I can get away with it. Posh banker, or Old Europe hitman.<br/><br/>Currently, I'm losing some weight to be able to get better clothes, and hand-in-hand with that I'm aiming to get more dressier clothes: A new formal jacket, slacks and the like. Heck, maybe even a traditional ascot/cravat: Whatever it takes to avoid being seen with a bowtie, which is what "Put This On" recommends a few times.<br/><br/>So for real, fashion: Bring it on. Heck, this thread even got me thinking about dressing up a bit (and no, I won't take no fucking pictures) at the next NC Gameday or meetup. But "Put This On" is not the site from which to learn about any fashion that I'd want seen on a person that wasn't captured in a Polaroid from 1968, at a "Thank the stars I was born white!" party in the English idyllic countryside.<br/><br/>In geek terms? It's a gaming blog (yay!) that only advocates adversarial GM-against-those-dumbass-players style of roleplaying (booooo!), where every one in 15-20 posts is something that you'd ever find useful to use at your table.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244516/#Comment_244516" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-01T19:28:29+00:00" title="December  1, 2009  7:28PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's what's called 'fashion victim', Tony.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244517/#Comment_244517" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-01T19:28:32+00:00" title="December  1, 2009  7:28PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just want to know easy ways to fold the pocket squares personally.

The same judgments get made and the same stakes are on the table, but the boundaries of that game are much, much smaller.  And really, I want to be reassured that this will always be the case, because while I've had girlfriends who made fashion look easy, I personally find it to be anything but.

This is not surprising to me as one of the writers of the blog is Jesse Thorn, co-host of the humor podcast Jordan Jesse GO!  I find his comedy to be at its core concerned with subtly mocking other people while at the same time making himself seem better.  Not a very charitable person in my eyes.  <br/><br/>My own personal fashion development began in college.  I moved from a big-small town in central Jersey to Philadelphia to attend an arts school and pursue my love of illustration.  While I was there I found that while I had applied my own sense of design to the art I was creating and looked for those things in the world around me, I didn't apply that aesthetic to myself.  It seemed hypocritical.  I changed.  <br/><br/>I'm big into line; it is the foundation of design, after all.  I find button-up dress shirts to be really comfortable.  I like ties.  I think they look cool (Look!  Another line!) and can be used to add some nice colours without them being overwhelming.  I'm a fat guy, so I look for pants that don't sag at the crotch or make my legs look stubby.  I'm on my feet a lot at work, so I find shoes that are really comfortable.  I work retail and get the very occasional bit of freelance illustration work, so I make the exact opposite of a lot of money.  Therefore, I also dress cheap.  <br/><br/>I say it's time to compare bits and bobs.  Do you guys have a favourite piece of clothing in your closet?  As for me, I have this great red and black striped tie that I have to keep myself from wearing every day ever because the angles and thicknesses of the lines are so perfect.  It makes me just damned happy to look at it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244532/#Comment_244532" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-01T20:39:51+00:00" title="December  1, 2009  8:39PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            May I just step in and say that <a href="http://www.utilikilts.com/" rel="nofollow">the utilikilt</a> is pretty much the dumbest thing ever, and the fact that I see hordes of them every GenCon is proof positive that gamers absolutely do need some serious fashion advice?<br/><br/>Anyway, I generally like Put This On, though I admit that they don't always feature clothing I would wear.

You can wear it with boots, or runners, or even what Yanks call flip-flops and we call thongs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244551/#Comment_244551" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-01T23:17:23+00:00" title="December  1, 2009 11:17PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I called them thongs when I was a kid.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244553/#Comment_244553" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-01T23:32:00+00:00" title="December  1, 2009 11:32PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 1, 2009 11:32PM by droog.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="image" src="http://www.souvenirsaustralia.com/images/thongs.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244554/#Comment_244554" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-01T23:54:00+00:00" title="December  1, 2009 11:54PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to be better dressed.

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            50 replies already? You can always tell which subjects are going to cause a stir, eh. If this was on another board I'd even call it trolling.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut seriously...I'm totally with Elizabeth here. I'm not interested in fashion in the sense "oh dear, this thing I bought last month isn't fashionable anymore, I must throw it away", it's all about aesthetics. You like good-looking things, don't you? Whether it's a book or dice or a building...why not clothes? And, yes, food. I spent most of my first year at college eating pasta with tuna, until I said "fuck this shit" and started to learn how to cook...maybe I spend a few more euros for food now, but I eat delicious homemade spring rolls and enchiladas and salads every day. It's the same with clothes. It's about pleasing the sense(s), and taste. And it takes some effort to get there (and I get why some people might be unwilling or not interested in making that effort).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I don't buy the "superficial" argument. It can be superficial if it's all you care about, and break down crying if you don't get the latest clothing item that was hyped in some magazine or another. And yes, the fashion industry can be superficial...are you saying the gaming industry can't? <br/>\n<br/>\nFashion for me doesn't mean buying and wearing the latest trend or following mags or buying a 20.000 dollar suit (Gob: "C'moooon!"). It's about knowing how to dress, looking good and pleasing the eye, just like music is about pleasing the ear, food about pleasing the tongue and so on. Whether you're wearing a 30 years old blazer or a new pair of pants, it doesn't matter as long as you don't look like a doofus. I understand this suggestion can be offensive to some. It's also about dressing for the occasion. I'm currently at home and I'm wearing a 10 year old t-shirt that survives from my metal days and a pair of dirty sweatpants. They are comfort clothes. They allow me to move freely and get dirty. But I'm not going to wear that to go on a date or for a job interview, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nI might go so far as to imply that the divide between nerds and fashion grows from the misunderstanding that fashion is about glitter and hair gel and Paris Hilton-looking blondes in pink and collar-popping douchebags in polo shirts...made up does not equal style. Just like putting five kinds of sauce on my fries is not going to make it good cuisine. The stigma is self-imposed. It's the subcultural tribalistic instinct to fit in and belong and thus differentiate from some other group. Perhaps this is where "dressing like a grown-up" fits in (although I find that phrase charged with stupidity). Stop dressing to belong to a group and start wearing what fits you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be this age's prevalent anti-intellectualism that made nerds dress badly.

I think I'm slightly more comfortable when everyone's comfortable (i.e. not in office dressies, but I'm probably projecting my own discomfort with ties and jackets on those who live in them every day), but I also take the dressed-up folks a bit more seriously. Comfortable &lt;&gt; serious in my own head. I don't know that I actually *care* one way or the other. Depends on my mood and needs. Some days, I just want to kick it and be specifically unserious. Other days I want to know I'm not dealing with emotional children.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244668/#Comment_244668" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-02T13:35:36+00:00" title="December  2, 2009  1:35PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: skinnyghost</cite>I don't think it was fair at all to accuse us of being "Afraid of Fashion" because we don't like the blog in question.</blockquote>\nIt wasn't fair.

I guess there is a trend now of small designers making high-end clothes in the style of american tradesmen's clothes from the '50s and '60s.  So you have plaid shirts for $150, handmade workboots for $600 and so on.  There was a self-labelled "flea market" of these designers in New York and many people were very critical of it for not honestly representing themselves (J. Crew had a table), not being truly "flea" (I guess there are hardcore thrift store treasure hunters who look for the authentic thing) and for slumming (rich hipster New Yorker office workers dressing like carpenters even though they've never touched a hammer).  Just one more cultural controversy in our first world of excessive wealth.  A lot of the discussion really made me think of Free Market.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244813/#Comment_244813" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T07:35:47+00:00" title="December  3, 2009  7:35AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            walkerp, <br/><br/>Interesting info on "classic americana". If you want to see crazy contrast of designer fashion and poverty, check <a href="http://www.meotive.com/2009/11/18/gentlemen-of-bacongo-the-dandies-of-sub-saharan-africa-dandy-fops/" rel="nofollow">this article about Dandy fashion in Sub-Saharan Africa</a>. Incidentally, a lot of those fashion trends you're mentioning aren't new. Consider military style clothing. Ska or punk style. These are just a few examples of everyday dress or modes of style that evolved from blue collar workers or professions. Fashion, like everything else, is derivative and cyclical and pulls from what it knows and sees in the world, aesthetically speaking. When Urban Outfitters first was born, they became infamously known for reselling thrifted jeans at 80$ a pop. Charlatans are out there everywhere, and you can't always trust a label (as anyone who has bought a Coach purse in chinatown would know.)<br/><br/>However, I totally agree that J. Crew can suck it. I'm not a fan of expensive clothing, cause I don't got the cash. But usually its true, designer labels have superior tailoring, will last longer, and are made of sturdier stuff than a t-shirt at Target. $600 is more than I would spend on boots, but, if they're handmade, who knows? As an artist, I believe in charging for something what it's worth. Many solo fashion designers or independent labels (ie people that hand-sew their clothes rather than send it to a factory overseas) charge more for their clothing because at that point you're buying wearable artwork. And if something is well made by an artist, I'm willing to shell out the extra dollar for their hard work. <br/><br/>As far as gamer fashion (back on thread topic): gaming culture is kinda counter-culture at times. Or includes many people that are counter-culture, that prefer to be weirdos, freaks, punk rock, goth, rebels, outcasts, geeks, or what have you. I think this is part of what feeds into all the odd modes of dress people often wear, and the gamer's penchant for wanting to cling to "gamer fashion". It counts them as "in" on the gamer culture and "out" with the rest of the boring people in the real world that all dress alike.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jaroslav" title="Jaroslav"><img alt="Jaroslav" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/119/nUV4BIYIKQOEC.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jaroslav">Jaroslav</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244817/#Comment_244817" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T07:47:39+00:00" title="December  3, 2009  7:47AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a whole other fascinating (to me, at least) tangent about jeans and what they symbolize.  There was a time when wearing jeans, if your job didn't require such, was a radical statement of working-class solidarity.  Slowly that has changed.  It's way to complicated to unpack here, I think there might be a whole book in it.  Jeans as fashion are international now, but certainly American in origin, and Americans have long been obsessed with showing each other and the world how down-to-earth they are.  (The law firm where I work occasionally has a "jeans day," usually as part of a fundraiser, and it's always strange to see the million-dollar-a-year partners wearing their jeans, showing you what regular people they are.)  I think there's a kind of desire for authenticity that may be American, or urban, or modern, or human.  ("Indie" communities, whether it's music, games, or what have you are one place where you see this.  The need to prove that you were into a certain band before they were popular, or even to show that you don't like them anymore now that they are popular is part of this.)  Jeans are a part of that desire.  I remember in the 80s (or was it even in the 70s) when it was a big deal that some companies started making jeans that were already worn in.  Now, I think more jeans come prefaded/frayed/distressed than not.  It's a weird desire to look like you've physically labored when you haven't.  (I held out on principle against these kinds of jeans for some time, then my wife finally convinced me to try them.  I had a pair of Banana Republic "distressed" jeans and they looked great, but they fell apart after only about a year, during which they were worn for, you know, jeans stuff - yard work, working in my wood shop, etc.  I'm back to my shrink-to-fit 501s now, though, I like my Carhartt "dungarees" a little more probably.  Just as tough, and a little more comfortable, to me, they have the looser fit of "relaxed fit" jeans without looking like them.)  Blah blah blah, this is probably not interesting to anybody else and certainly has nothing to do with gaming.<br/><br/>If you look in the mirror and you like the way you present yourself, and the people whose opinions you care about seem to react well to the way you present yourself, then that seems to be what's important about fashion.  If, however, that girl or boy you like won't give you the time of day, maybe a fashion blog (not necessarily any particular one mentioned in this thread) can help.  For others, fashion is just fun and that's the reward.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244830/#Comment_244830" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T08:30:10+00:00" title="December  3, 2009  8:30AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, what's the Theory of Jeans say if you expressly refuse to buy or wear blue ones? I own more tan and brown Carhartt's than any other style.<br/><br/>And as for "gamer uniform," I'll repeat what I said above: I just don't see it, be it at cons or at meet-ups or at LARP events. There might be a large minority of gamers that fit the "black gamer T with jeans or cargo shorts" look, but I see everything from khakis and button-downs (thanks for the reminder, Robert!) to fetish wear, name brands to artfully outmoded thrift store ensembles.<br/><br/>In short: I reject the bullshit stereotype--it doesn't actually bear out, in practice (see other thread). You'll see more conformity or uniformity at a frat party social, sporting event, or the average beer bar than at a gaming con (costuming notwithstanding!). The hobby cuts across too many demographics--age, financial, educational--to be pigeon-holed, even if it makes for a funny bit of snark on a forum.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244865/#Comment_244865" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T10:26:54+00:00" title="December  3, 2009 10:26AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hehe... well, it looks like io9 has a "geek wear" line up:<br/><a href="http://io9.com/5415534/a-sci-fashion-gift-guide-tees-socks-and-weirder-stuff" rel="nofollow">http://io9.com/5415534/a-sci-fashion-gift-guide-tees-socks-and-weirder-stuff</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244866/#Comment_244866" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T10:29:18+00:00" title="December  3, 2009 10:29AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2009 12:45PM by Ben_Johnson.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I like Put This On. I put less weight on the individual clothing recommendations, but I really appreciate the way Jesse talks about style. I think it's more that he's somebody about my age, who I have met and gotten along with, who makes <em>me</em> think about clothes.<br/><br/>I turned 30 recently, and I'd been somewhat bothered by the fact that I was dressing similarly to the way I did when I was in undergrad. I mean, my style of gaming has changed more radically than my style of dress, and how many people see me game, versus how many see me wear clothes? My clothing choices were usually defined by whatever happened to be on top of the pile that morning. When I went out to buy "better" clothes, I would walk into stores, look at things, try things on, shrug my shoulders and plop down some money. I'm a geek, I like to understand how things work, and I do not understand clothes.<br/><br/>This was recently compounded by a move from casual-hippy San Francisco to buttoned-down New York City. It's not just the well-coiffed and -suited gentlemen on the subways in the morning. No, my office full of t-shirt-and-shorts-in-winter engineers is right downstairs from a Manhattan modeling agency. Every time I get in the elevator, I get a reminder that I Could Be Putting More Thought Into This. But beyond vowing never to pay money for another t-shirt for the foreseeable future, I wasn't sure what to do.<br/><br/>It was about this time that Jesse and Adam started Put This On.<br/><br/>I don't pay much attention to the specific item recommendations. To me, that's the cost of entry when you're a part-time operation by two guys with day jobs who need to live up to the expectation for daily updates that comes with modern blogs. I'm more interested in the posts that talk about <a href="http://putthison.com/post/263446635/shoplikemymom" rel="nofollow">strategies</a> <a href="http://putthison.com/post/248576007/giltgroupeinvite" rel="nofollow">for</a> <a href="http://putthison.com/post/246119143/vestalterations" rel="nofollow">putting</a> <a href="http://putthison.com/post/240869862/triptothetailor" rel="nofollow">in</a> the actual legwork of developing a personal style (and some of the How To stuff is pretty useful too, like <a href="http://putthison.com/post/247377874/tyingleathershoelaces" rel="nofollow">tying leather shoelaces</a>). Anyway, I'm a game designer, not a public radio host. The wardrobe I develop is going to take that into account.<br/><br/>I'm actually kind of excited to be exploring the idea of "what goes in the wardrobe of this well-dressed game designer?" Haters know where they can stick their WrongBadFun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244867/#Comment_244867" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T10:30:57+00:00" title="December  3, 2009 10:30AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>Hehe... well, it looks like io9 has a "geek wear" line up:<br/><a href="http://io9.com/5415534/a-sci-fashion-gift-guide-tees-socks-and-weirder-stuff" rel="nofollow">http://io9.com/5415534/a-sci-fashion-gift-guide-tees-socks-and-weirder-stuff</a></blockquote>\nThe Penny Arcade empire smells money here, too.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.pennyarcademerch.com/firstparty.html" rel="nofollow">First Party</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244897/#Comment_244897" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T12:25:33+00:00" title="December  3, 2009 12:25PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everyone's being entirely too polite in this thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hate business casual, it's the best way to look like someone who hates their entire life and works for assholes, however when only upper management and upper management brown-noser wanna-bes wear suits and ties it sure is easy to pick out who the assholes are and to avoid any kind of meaningful communication with them lest they file it away in their little rat-brains for future leverage against you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, fuck sandals.

Let's get Fashion Nazi!<br><br>Fuck tank tops--about 2% of the US population can pull them off (and we WANT them to pull them off, when we see them in a tank!). The rest of you skinny and fat fuckers... invest in sleeves, and learn to appreciate the power of "loose fit."<br><br>Hip-hugger jeans. Um... damn, where to begin? Well, there's the obvious: if the widest part of your lower torso is NOT your hips, forget hip-huggers. If they waist is lower than the top of your ass crack, CAREFULLY consider how many people will enjoy seeing your ass crack... then divide by about 10, for a realistic estimate. Finally, unless you are willing to show the rest of them to anyone who asks, wear underwear that rides LOWER than your hip-huggers. Remember: a whale tail is a PROMISE!<br/><br/>Nothing says, "I am hard-to-fit fashion victim" like Utilikilts. A Utilikilt with a tight black T-shit is are even worse. If you're going to wear a pleated wrap-dress with cargo pockets, at least fill out the top with balancing pleats, darts, dags, ruffles, frills, lace, or layers. Maybe even a vest or sports jacket and tie.<br/><br/>Wrap pant wearers! DON'T forget the "wrap" part, you exhibitionist twits. Wrap pants are NOT elasticated hot pants with trailing "leg scarfs." If I get a chance to stand on your dragging ankle ties and let you walk completely the fuck out of them, I will.<br/><br/>You! Skate punk and/or wannabee gangster! Pull up your fucking pants, and maybe reel in a couple of yards of that chain! I figure if someone could kick you square in the anus with only your ($20, designer) boxers in the way, that should be carte blanche to do so at will. At the least, you should be banned from sitting on public chairs and benches....<br/><br/>If you're not a heroine junkie or an athlete in the middle of a game, slip-on sleeves are off limits. I don't care if the alternating pink and black stripes match your hair--you look like the love child of Doctor Seuss and Marilyn Manson.<br/><br/>(I could do this all day....)                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244929/#Comment_244929" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T13:46:09+00:00" title="December  3, 2009  1:46PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was just about to post in the "What are you wearing?" thread to say "Business casual with a tie, wrap pants and slip-on sleeves", but I'm certainly not gonna do that NOW.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244937/#Comment_244937" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T14:03:20+00:00" title="December  3, 2009  2:03PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Remember, kids, you can always tell who people are by what they're wearing.

There was a time when I regularly wore bandanas, and now I almost never do, despite owning several very nice ones that I'm rather fond of. Dress is, I feel, about showing you prepared for the situation. It's not about wearing a tie to a backyard barbeque, it's about knowing when to put the bandana on, and when to leave it. It's about being able to confidently "dress like myself" regardless of the event or level of formality. The "maturity" is shown in the thoughtfulness and discretion with which style is applied more than whether you're wearing tweed, denim or silk.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Benhimself</cite>Shopping for the best clothes is all well and good, but how much you work out will have a MUCH larger effect on your Appearance Score.
