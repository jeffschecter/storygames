Samuel Maverick (John Harper) is trying to bind the ghost of Leonard Digges,a recurring enemy, to within 7 paces of a tree. He's angling for a challenging Sorcery test, so he declares this spell will bind him to the spot for all time. This being a challenging test, his chances of success are kind of low, so as he gets ready to roll the dice we start throwing out ideas of what kind of twist I can inflict if he fails (a failed roll never means nothing). There's some talk about obvious missfires, having the spell temporarily bind Sam or something. Then Paul suggests the best twist I've ever heard: Instead of binding Digges ghost to within seven paces of this tree, he would bind the ghost to within seven paces of himself.<br/><br/>I've never wanted a PC to fail a roll more.<br/><br/>But he succeeded, and typical Burning Boston hijinks ensued, with demon possessions, a crisis of faith, an impending assault on the island. Just the usual.<br/><br/>This all took place on Noddle Island, now the location of Logan Airport, which half makes me want to run a game of InSpectres with a ghost haunting one of the runways, never more then seven paces away...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255055/#Comment_255055" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-04T12:16:40+00:00" title="February  4, 2010 12:16PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WFRP 3e, 8 sessions in. <br/><br/>After burning down the Imperial town of Rottfurt due to Chaos incursion, the PCs found an orphan child in Marienburg who many professed to be Sigmar reborn.  The child crusade pushed to Altdorf where the boy was kidnapped and went missing.  The PCs are currently tracking a cell of the same cult that they routed from Rottfurt who they think to be linked to the boy's disappearance.  <br/><br/>OK, so you're caught up.  PCs beat the hell out of a captured cultists and ascertain that a "shipment" was sent from the Altdorf docks to the town of Bogenhafen in the Southern Reikland.  They believe it to be Chaos contraband (like, maybe Warpstone) and upon arriving in Bogenhafen discover the cultists arrived with a coffin which was turned over to the cult of Morr (Priests associated with death/burial) and buried in the Bogenhafen garden of Morr (cemetary).  The PCs are lead by a Witch Hunter so easily gain access to dig the SOB up and what do they find?  No, not Warpstone - Karl Franz, Emperor of the Old World.<br/><br/>So more awesome a session later.  One of the PCs is a Dwarf who has a Belief concerning his swearing allegiance to a prominent Imperial Baron.  The Baron arrives in the chaotic rioting battleground of Altdorf for Karl Franz's funeral where he meets with the Dwarf PC.  After some time revelling, he praises the Dwarf for all the good work he has done concerning rooting out cultists and promises him more land and wealth in the coming future.  Then he hands the Dwarf a leaflet of letters and explains that he has discovered the Countess Emmanuelle of Nuln (one of the Elector Counts of the Empire) was responsible for the assassination of Karl Franz.  They do not have hard evidence yet, so he wants to the Dwarf to plant the forged correspondence during their investigation and have the other PCs discover the letters which will implicate the Countess in the cult they are chasing as well as the disappearance of the boy believed to be Sigmar's heir.<br/><br/>The player broke out of character to call me a dick (in a good way) for putting him up against the wall.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255138/#Comment_255138" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-04T23:38:27+00:00" title="February  4, 2010 11:38PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 4, 2010 11:44PM by Hans_c-o.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My faith in roleplaying is restored.<br/><br/>We played <i><b>Perfect</b></i> tonight (GMless!).<br/><br/>Johnathan Ayers bombs a building and pours corrosive acid underneath the eyes of a statue of Queen Abigail, making her appear to weep.

It was definitely one of those anime episodes where you're like "What the fuck, writers/animators?"<br/><br/>But then in the end, despite all that, we really pulled it together. The four valkyries stabbed Odin in the chest with a spear carved from the World Tree and the spear, in turn, blossomed into a giant tree that brought Valhalla to the ground and began destroying and remaking the world.<br/><br/>Even experienced players totally fuck things up sometimes, even in a big performance situation like the climactic last session of a campaign, but on a good day we can pull ourselves out of it and that's what happened here.

Ed hits the bars in Chicago looking to harass friends of Enzo Medici while Yuri sets up with a sniper rifle across the street at each stop. Amy, meanwhile, is pushing the bits and looking for facts in the Medici family computer system. Ed tries to enlist Yuri's help by staking out one of Enzo's favourite haunts in a purely observational role for a couple of days non-stop. That means adult diapers, and Yuri is not interested. He gives a "Fuck that" and Ed's (JB's) grabbed teamwork dice are lost. Meanwhile Amy's investigation goes sour and she notices someone is downloading data from her laptop. She dumps it and gets clear. Ed enters the bar and discovers Enzo there and they converse. Enzo says the whole thing is his father's game \u2014 dad is setting him to to get taken down by the Agency because he's a loose cannon. Enzo offer's Ed a fat wad of cash, which Ed takes. JB has Ed MOVE ON \u2014 he's an enemy agent working for Enzo now \u2014 and so we lose his perspective. So we see Yuri, rifle over a window-sill, with his souvenir from Utah, a ceramic hula girl, beside his rifle. From Yuri's scope, he sees Enzo and Ed get real friendly and then some money changes hands. Then he sees Enzo give Ed a handgun and Yuri assumes Ed has been turned. He opens fire, killing Enzo, Ed, and people they don't even know. As his rifles kicks around on full auto, we pan briefly to his grin behind the scope and then back to the hulu girl which, knocked from the sill, falls to the street and shatters. Pan up to the wrecked bar, the screaming and the sirens. Fade to black.<br/><br/>Return to focus in a wrecked and overgrown lot on the outskirts of Chicago. In the far background, loud music is playing. In the foreground, Yuri and Amy are trying to figure out what they should do now. A black Mercedes pulls up and Joel (JB's promotion, a Senior Field Agent) steps out. He demands to know how things got so fucked up and explains how they are going to improve.

It's our first "proper" session, having done the game creation session last week.<br/><br/>The game is set in London, in 1985.<br/><br/>Maria (Gangrel, kinda of an outsider who tries to keep waifs and stray safe) has just finished quizzing Julia (Nosferatu, sociopathic low-rent madame) about some dead prostitutes and is leaving Julia's brothel.  On her way out, Maria spots Daisy, one of Julia's girls who she's trying to "save". In fact, saving her from Julia is Maria's (very powerful) Personal Agenda.<br/><br/>She decides that she's going to take Daisy away from Julia, right here and now.<br/><br/>It's Maria's Influence vs Julia's. Maria has both 4 points of Personal agenda and 2 points of positive relationship with daisy.<br/><br/>Maria wins by 2, despite Julia also having relationship dice in the conflict.and Julia's negative "Inhuman" trait comes up as her highest die.<br/><br/>Daisy leaves with Maria, and Julia's negative trait causes her to beat a customer to death in a fit of rage after hearing that Daisy has left with Maria.<br/><br/>The episode ends with a silent scene as Maria arrives at the hospital A&amp;E with the abused girl, and hands her over to Dr Keith. He's an NPC we established during the game creation session. He knows about the Kindred, is vaguely in love with Maria and wants to help the downtrodden.<br/><br/>(At the start of this scene and lasting throughout, as if on queue,<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKdxJwKU5zw" rel="nofollow"> Public Image Ltd's The Order of Death </a>comes up on the 1985 appropriate playlist. Which was fucking perfect!)<br/><br/>He looks to Daisy, this grubby, slightly bruised 17 year old with needle tracks up her arms, and it's clear that she will be well looked after here in the hospital until she's healthy again.<br/><br/>Dr Keith looks back up, about to speak, but Maria is nowhere to be seen.<br/><br/>The camera shifts and we see that Julia is standing on a corner not far away, and has seen exactly what's happened. The look in her eyes makes one thing clear: Daisy is not safe yet, here or anywhere.<br/><br/>I am REALLY looking forward to the next session of this.  I haven't played Vampire in something like 12 years and haven't enjoyed it this much in 15.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256924/#Comment_256924" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-17T04:36:40+00:00" title="February 17, 2010  4:36AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apocalypse World.

If there is a method in which a ship can engage in offensive action, they by-god have it installed. <br/><br/>I have clearly, CLEARLY been given the high-sign to start the campaign off with a space battle.<br/><br/>I stat up the ships and the crew for the bad guys, and read and re-read that mini-game til I've got it; got it DOWN.<br/><br/>We start play and I foreshadow the shit out of the coming fight; I whisper the promise of Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion, or something.<br/><br/>We get to the point where the beam weapons shall hit the fan...<br/><br/>And my players basically force the situation into a Social Combat.<br/><br/>Which I'm totally unprepared to run.

One of the enemy pirate captains flew away from the confrontation, put his ship in dry dock, sold it (at a loss), and took up farming on a world with carnivorous plant life... and he considers himself better off.<br/><br/>Good game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257145/#Comment_257145" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-18T20:18:18+00:00" title="February 18, 2010  8:18PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 18, 2010 8:27PM by lordgoon.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In this week's session of <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/moochava/genius" rel="nofollow">Genius: The Transgression</a>, our group of mad scientists were hired by an obese black market kingpin to travel back in time to 1952 and prevent the evil supercomputer Meggido from spiralling into madness.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Eggman fiddled with the controls of the time machine - he was in a subversive mood after having lost tenure at the University of Washington when the entire campus was scorched out of existence by a  laser from space.

Mountain Witch, Act II.  <br/><br/>I decide that a creepy, but hitherto harmless NPC needs to die.  My character is very, very courteous.<br/><br/>Me: "I pick up my sword, which is sitting to my right, and place it to my left.  This is an overt act of hostility."<br/>Ben: "Umm, okay.  How is it hostile?"<br/>Me: "When you're a guest in someone's house, you put your sword to your right when you sit down because it's hard to draw from there.  On your left, it's easy."<br/>Ben: "Ah, got it.  The guy sees you do this, and hesitates for a moment.  He then turns and..."<br/>Me: "I kill him."<br/>Everyone at the table: "DUDE!"<br/>Me: "What?  I gave him three whole seconds.  You can't ask for much more than that."<br/><br/>Best part: at the end of the session, pretty much EVERYONE gives me extra Trust, because "he's the only one who's actually acting like a proper Samurai."<br/><br/><br/><br/>A day ago.  Mountain Witch, Act III.<br/><br/>Lesley's character kills an NPC.  Marco's character witnesses the deed, and says "Great.  You just killed the ONE PERSON who could have helped me regain my honor.  I was supposed to be the one to kill her."  A moment later, my character encounters another player character, the object of his vengeance, and begins his Inigo Montoyez soliloquy.  Halfway through, the other character dies horribly due to previously established offscreen sorcery.<br/><br/>Me: "Marco, from down the hall you hear me say 'That didn't go as planned... Revenge seems to be denied me.'"<br/>Marco:  "My character opens a side door, steps in, and grunts - 'Yeah, that seems to be happening a lot tonight.'"<br/><br/>The way I see it, revenge denied once is tragedy.  Revenge denied twice is comedy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A day ago.  Mountain Witch, Act IV.<br/><br/>Jonathan's dead PC with a LOT of banked Trust returns as a boddhisatva.  With his aid, I win two consecutive conflicts and two subsequent iaijutsu duels.  The Witch is dead (or so we think), the Raven Queen is twitching, mangled, and bleeding out in the courtyard four stories below, Lukas' character is cut in two, and Marco just lost a duel against me, with a margin of 12(!).  Lesley's character says "I suppose I'm next...  unless you'd rather finish this another night?"  And in the epilogue, she becomes my finest student, and kills me twenty years later once she's mastered my Buddha-graced style of swordsmanship.  <br/><br/>I can't believe it took me... what... five years to finally give this game a try?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257156/#Comment_257156" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-18T23:49:23+00:00" title="February 18, 2010 11:49PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Apocalypse World tonight Iris, my dear confused Brainer, finally managed to get the blood on his hands he so desperately desired.

When the action was even remotely looking like it was going stale, I was quick to concede for the bad guys (all save the big Final Confrontation with it very surprising ending).  My concessions always led to some complication to the group's plans, but the team whipped enemy butt and cleaned up the town in the end.<br/><br/>My favorite example of a maneuver was when some summoned monkey-mooks aided their beastmaster boss by placing the aspect "Poo-flinging suppressive fire" on the rooftop setting of a chase scene, forcing the freerunner PC to have to divert around the area.

Lots of stuff happened.<br/><br/>Our fighter's friend-with-benefits (an infernal grad student from Dis) asked him to choose between an intensified thing with her and the Paragon path he's all hot for.  He chose the Paragon path.  Romance is dead!<br/><br/>Our tiefling warlord's family is causing all kinds of trouble.  Warlord Dad is poised to take the family mercenary company and sack Bahamut's millenium temple -- the Bahamutiest place in the whole Middle World.  It's gonna be a hoedown, as there's 1000 years of platinum and a bunch of religious fervor involved.  If you can hold a sword, you're gonna be there.  <br/><br/>Our PC warlord is uncertain where he stands on all this.  Warlord Dad's an asshole, but the Church is hella-corrupt.  It's complex.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Warlord Mom is put out that Warlord Dad knocked up their daughter-in-law (who was widowed, but still....).  So Warlord Mom is conspiring with an Asmodeus-worshiping refugee army to unleash a Rain of Colorless Fire WMD upon the battle, killing all those capable warriors and leaving the battered old Empire ripe for rebirth...as Hell On Earth.<br/><br/>Little does she know that the Crimson Blades have a city-busting WMD of their own, a so-called Writ of Wrath.  The Writ was issued to our deva avenger -- our platinum Terminator, our Vineyard pitbull -- by Bahamut himself.  Our avenger is never uncertain about anything, which is why I wanted him to have the power to kill an entire city.  <br/><br/>The avenger plots with some NPCs to smuggle the Writ of Wrath into Warlord Family's compound.  There he will invoke the Writ's inexorable platinum radiance, melting Mom's WMDs and Warlord Dad's mercenary company, and also Mom and Dad, and a whole bunch of sympathetic cousins and an unborn bastard niece.  Maybe the Blades too.  The Writ has no instruction manual.<br/><br/>Warlord Son, the PC, seems strangely sanguine about this tidy solution, and as I'd entered the evening with the intention of provoking him into murdering his extended family and their comrades, I was happy.<br/><br/>The Crimson Blades, though, do nothing the easy way.  See, it's actually the fighter's fault that Warlord Mom has a Rain of Colorless Fire on hand.  It's a long story, but suffice to say that his special naked devil friend got some benefit from their relationship as well.  The fighter's conscience is all screwed up, and he's prepared to sacrifice himself if he can prevent the 1000 people in Warlord Family from being de-rezzed by grey light.  <br/><br/>The Rain of Colorless Fire WMDs are actually adult children, hyper-powerful sorcerers bred to be absurdly good at doing just one spell, and with their development arrested to keep them morally simple.  After a couple improbable rolls, the fighter bluffs them them out of their safe chamber.  And, unmindful of the ~5000XP of potential badguy on the battlematt, he starts the killing.<br/><br/>Of twelve WMDs (the numbers are for redundancy, not potency), eleven die in his first attack.  But the last one nipped away, and it took the Blades the entire rest of the night to kill it.  They slew 5000XP of opposition without one single rest.  The PCs rolled eleven death saves.  At one point, only a barred door separated the reeling avenger from his final prey.  (Pro tip--if you've got an inexorable avenger who's tweaked out with a low STR, put a DC20 barred door in his way and watch him wail!) <br/><br/>In the end, none of the PCs died, though I had most of them knocked down at one point or another.  They did lose a treasured goblin companion NPC, who had a bad run of death save luck.  They left nothing in the locker room and just barely squeaked out the final kill,   And afterwards, they were too worn out to do anything about the sacking of the Bahamut Vatican, which proceeded on schedule.<br/><br/>We'll explore the results of this when we pick up again sometime later this year.  But I need a rest first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258975/#Comment_258975" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-27T15:08:14+00:00" title="February 27, 2010  3:08PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Homebrew fantasy game! <br/><br/>The group has some cards describing what events will let them level up.

I was way simulationistic today, and let them face all sorts of practical realistic details.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryant" title="Bryant"><img alt="Bryant" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryant">Bryant</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259013/#Comment_259013" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-27T19:53:20+00:00" title="February 27, 2010  7:53PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason is playing an eladrin (snooty elf), Corrilon. The party gets jumped on the way back from a gladiator camp by a bunch of feral eladrin. Their leader is a scary eladrin knight who immediately decides that Corrilon is a traitor to his race, tells him so, and focuses his attention on the evil bastard traitor eladrin slime who's probably a slaver.<br/><br/>First round, Corrilon's compatriot Faral says "wait, we're friends, don't do this." The knight says "prove it, drop your weapon!" She does, and the knight says "OK, that's pretty good, but I'm still finishing my duel with this traitor guy." Battle continues. Everyone lets Corrilon and the knight face off -- Faral doesn't even throw any healing at Corrilon. It's pretty close! The knight puts a sword right through Corrilon's gut, which keeps him from running away and using his bow, which is what Corrilon really wants to do. Then the next round I tell Jason to roll the dice to see if the attack recharges, and it does. The knight tries to stab Corrlion again, and if he hits it's probably going to take Corrilon down. But he misses! And Corrilon stabs the knight again, and the knight's down to negative hit points.<br/><br/>Jason: "OK, can I hold back and reduce him to 1 hit point but knock him prone?" I say sure, since that's strictly inferior to knocking him out and I want to see where Jason is going with this. Jason says "OK, cool, and then I do this," and he extends his hand across the table to me like he's wanting to help me up. I hope I was grinning like a madman, because I hope Jason knew how cool that was! I/the eladrin knight take Jason/Corrilon's hand, and the knight calls on his people to stand down, and the situation defuses. A dryad pulls this big shambling mound off the halfling. Etc.<br/><br/>Then the players find out that they have some <b>really</b> tough choices to make, but that's a longer story and they manage to split the difference mostly because of the awesome honor Corrilon showed. Great session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259015/#Comment_259015" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-27T20:04:00+00:00" title="February 27, 2010  8:04PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apocalypse World of Dust<br/><br/>My character, the skinner Tristan Pariah, has had "future badness" announced him a number of times over several sessions. God's chosen slayer, Buffy, is hunting him in order to get at his beloved, the angel Kyrami. One of Tristan's girls, Tranja, has made it clear that he owes her some fancy body armor and weapons or she walks from the gang. They're walking down in the market and Tranja points to a battle babe in decked out custom armor. "I want that armor." Ever confident, Tristan walks up to use his skinner mojo on the lady in question... and rolls snake eyes.<br/><br/>A few minutes later, he's kneeling in the dust with a gun pointed at his head and asks, "will you at least tell me your name?"<br/><br/>"Buffy."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
