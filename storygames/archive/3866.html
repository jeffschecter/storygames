Later, he went and played Shock with them, one afternoon. I'm pretty sure he had never even heard of the game before. He had a good time, so after the game was over, he dropped by my place, and explained the rules. And when I say he "explained the rules" I mean he literally told me exactly how to play the game. Then we made some characters and played the game! Sure, we only did one scene, just so I would understand, but we still played it. Two guys who didn't read the rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo later the both of us went and played it with Joe (and Chad). I got to look at the book, but I didn't read any of it. It was the same game. There might have been a clarification of a point or two, but mostly it was exactly what Joseph explained to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I kept hearing (reading, I guess) about how the book is unplayable on it's own. You need the errata, or whatever. Even Joe McDonald agreed with the criticism, to some degree. So I was a wee bit hesitant to get the book. Especially since I already knew how to play!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end, I said screw it, and bought the damn book anyway. And, well, the game was all there. It didn't confuse me at all, really. I think there is a discrepancy about whether your Antagonist is to the right or left, but nothing seemed broken about it to me. A few typos or whatever, sure, but hey, it's an rpg...<br/>\n<br/>\nI learned we did a few things "wrong" - like everybody who wanted to add minutiae got to apply their d4 roll to the Tagonists, and I don't think we were picking up new Features for failing a conflict (but maybe I'm wrong about that one). In any case, nothing that changed the game. I can even see tons of house rules being applied by different play groups. Like using your own protagonist instead of making a seperate antagonist for somebody else.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I dunno, guys. I don't think this game is complicated enough to be confusing!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

It makes me happy when I hear the stories of people having fun with it.</p>\n<p>The mistakes you made are easy to make, but it's important that you not make them next time. The first one completely obviates the Protag's roll, making hir success and failure a matter of democracy. The second one makes the Protag much less likely to pull through at the end and monkeys a bit with pacing. But you saw the correct stuff in the text and know what to do next time, which will be more fun.</p>\n<p>What was your demo scene?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86803/#Comment_86803" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T20:19:21+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  8:19PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2007 8:19PM by Johnstone.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Funny enough, I don't remember the demo scene!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we played with only 4 people, it wasn't that big a deal when two people both applied minutiae, but yeah, I can see it turning into a fiasco otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the first full game, I played a revolutionary - a sci-fi Che Guevarra in Bolivia - who wanted reincarnation to be available to everybody, not just the rich. I succeeded at all my scenes until the end, where I failed my Story Goal (Revolution!), so maybe I'm just forgetting whether we got new features. It definitely makes for the classic, lose-lose-lose-win story.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you know, after posting this thread, I've been looking over Shock 1.1, and I must say, it's really good! I think the explanations of playing the game are much clearer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
