This was the second time playing it for most of us and we, er, did it better this time - our crime lord, mockney hoodlum, wannabe yuppie and investigative reporter ended up all in the same place before the tilt, set up to meet Robbie Clay (said crime lord)'s shipment of Romanian hookers, er, asylum seekers down the docks for a whole confused shitstorm of reasons, and similar misunderstanding led to us not realising we were all trying to rob each other and all being in Clay's van at the end (with said asylum seeker, of course) as the police close in and we turn on each other. Roll the aftermath and Clay's player gets White 16 or something - leaving him clean as a whistle while the rest of us - including the reporter - get all the resultant deaths and mess pinned on us.<br/><br/>After our first run-through a few weeks ago (three of us playing through The Ice) we all throught we needed to play Fiasco again and thought we might do better at it - and it turns out we were right. Awesome game - I can only apologise to myself for the eight months or so I owned Fiasco before actually playing it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353106/#Comment_353106" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-04T06:51:41+00:00" title="January  4, 2012  6:51AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Played the umpteenth version of <a href="http://sombraconsole.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Sombra Console</a> on Monday with Eric, Lisa, Andy and Tim (for a short bit). We made characters, got a job (entice the upstairs neighbors to vacate for half the original dollar offer), went back and forth on planning for quite a while, and eventually went with kidnapping the President/CEO of the QNE (not a franchise like an <a href="http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/Franchise-Organized+Quasi-National+Entity" rel="nofollow">FOQNE</a> would be) and convincing her at gun point. I loved how the system provided cool successes (taking down a MMA master in one strike) and awkward failures (failing to silence the President with the gun barrel in the mouth routine, leaving her with a bleeding grazed cheek) and pseudo successes (finally silencing the President with a hand on mouth - she bites down, my hand is still firmly there, but I cry out!)<br/><br/>Andy had a string of awful luck, but because of the point system, used that to become the ultimate negotiator in the final scene. Heaven knows what consequences this will have for our characters!<br/><br/>My guy was a Russian neo-Muslim with a bullet rosary.

Our tone was "Freedom".<br/><br/>Irvin Keech is a Lag, a disgraced scientist sent as a free man to the colony. His wife, Nelma, came with him and is now having an affair with the Dimber Damber, the awesomely-named Gidner Pull. Pull taps a Wrecker, Rhona Sheppett, with the unenviable task of killing his rival. She balks and runs to Nelma, a sometimes Wrecker herself, who sells Rhona out to her lover and then finishes the bloody job, murdering her husband. <br/><br/>The Dimber Damber gives up Rhona for the crime, and the Governor is eager to see her hang. Judge-Advocate Clarvis Fowderhop ("I will never subvert justice") gets backed into a corner and agrees, despite the mass of evidence supporting Rhona's innocence. She dies, and Fowderhop stops being Judge-Advocate. Nelma makes a graceless transition to Sable gun-moll, wraps Gidner Pull around her little finger, and single-handedly demolishes his entire criminal enterprise through venality, greed and stupidity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353113/#Comment_353113" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-04T08:07:35+00:00" title="January  4, 2012  8:07AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 4, 2012 10:47AM by J_Walton.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mouse Guard black ops, session 3<br/><br/>After getting into a street shooting battle with a bunch of gangsters and losing the Soyuz black box, John's PC tortures the remaining gangster to try to find where the box might be headed.  He rolls 5 dice and gets 4 snakes and 1 success. "Shit."  Then I roll 5 dice and get 5 snakes.  Ridiculous.  After losing a hand, Not Nice confesses that Coolie Boy is half-Amerindian and is probably going to head up the Essequibo River into the Guyanan jungle and disappear until things calm down.<br/><br/>"Weaver, we gotta go," John's dude says. Helping his compatriot, who's pale from bloodloss after being machete'd in the arm last session, they get into a quazi-chase conflict with the Friction, which is in full-blown "Chaos" mode (the equivalent of Winter weather), as the paramilitary is everywhere.  I write down the Friction's goal.  "What does the chaos want?" I say out loud. "Oh, it wants you to come face-to-face with the creepy guy in the unmarked uniform and the other folks that are chasing you, rather that having you slip quietly away."  We script the first round.  I Feint first, saying that there's a guy with binoculars casing John's current location. But John Attacks and uses Scout to spot that dude and blend into the crowd of injured people strewn about in the aftermath of the firefight. Then he taps his Nature for more dice and takes me down to 4 Disposition.<br/><br/>Next, I've scripted Maneuver to his Defend and beat him by three dice.  He and Weaver limp into an old pickup truck, he hotwires the engine, and they pull away, but as they leave a nearby onlooker yells, "Hey!" and watches them carefully as they head down the street in his vehicle.  So much for an anonymous getaway.  But now we've both scripted Attack, as John puts his foot to the floor and takes out the rest of my Disposition while the guy in the unmarked uniform is slower in his pursuit but still takes John's PC and Weaver down to less than half (thanks to bonus dice from the previous Maneuver), forcing a major compromise.  We decide that John's tracker is 12 hours behind them, but is piecing together their trail in relentless, steady pursuit and is following them alone.  Maybe that face-to-face confrontation will happen eventually, but not if they can stay ahead of him.<br/><br/>John's PC spends his Player Turn check to make a Circles roll to try to find a doctor for Weaver -- which he tried and failed to do at the end of last session too.  He fails again, but we decide he succeeds with a condition -- Tired, after having to lug Weaver's carcass up a long hill to the local doctor's house.  They put Weaver on a bag of blood and ensure he'll be feeling chipper for their crazy trip up the Essequibo next session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353175/#Comment_353175" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-04T20:17:21+00:00" title="January  4, 2012  8:17PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 4, 2012 8:19PM by John_Harper.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Black Ops is so fun.<br/><br/>I really like how the abstracted conflict system of MG makes cool spy action really easy to handle.

His partners are go-getters, one some kind of psychic boy wonder (who is so afraid of magic he urinates on himself in its presence if he fails a SAN saving throw) and the other a demon prince of carnage who made a bad deal and got stuck possessing some dude named Blankenship more or less forever (his STR is 33). <br/><br/>Some enterprising Organizatsiya thug has been importing succubi to infiltrate the Democratic national convention.

Only thing we left out was the roll-with-punch rules, because I despise them. GM FIAT.<br/><br/>Agent Smiles is getting close to pulling the pin and retiring; obviously, he can't retire, and he can't die, since those are the obvious choices. Got to figure out a way to make this end really spectacularly for him.<br/><br/>His psi-energy is pretty low, so Smiles was being cagey with his magic use. It'll be fun to see how he handles a major source of magical energy, like a Ley Line or Nexus Point.<br/><br/>The demon is an interesting character; he's immensely strong, but his host body is that of a pencilneck scientist. He can rip a car in half, but he has no bonuses to strike, and he doesn't have any weapon skills. Thus, he's not a formidable combatant, just a guy who kicks down doors and breaks safes open with his fists. And he is a supergenius science guy.<br/><br/>The "emo man-child" psychic sensitive is a hoot, because he's always ready to fight, but he's walking around with a revolver and no combat powers -- he can sense danger, and then shoot at it. But Smiles has all the fireballs and lightning. But Smiles is too old for this shit, and won't even get out of the van to investigate a mangled corpse. He did, in fact, actually back the van up so he could lean out and have a look at the dead body, rather than get wet.

Said client, while on route to some place or another, was shot at and poisoned with crossbow bolts loaded with "Chinese systemic shit." Had to replace her limbic system, which got us into deep trouble with local splice/fencer. Much action, other players using Move, Coax, Operate, and Prowl in psychic ways.

At the table were me, Robo, Dan, Rafael and Curtis.<br/><br/>After the setup we had two families - the Fleetwoods and the Spindlehams. Old Man Fleetwood was a rich power broker who held the debt to the Spindleham family business, The Original Georgia Nut House. His two children were true ne'er-do-well losers, and he'd written them out of the will in favor of his new wife, an exotic dancer-turned pecan picker named Atlanta (who was the most grounded character in the session by far). Allen Spindleham wanted to keep the business so bad he turned to his drug dealer brother for ideas, and Roscoe, a genuine idiot, came up with a plan to steal a tractor trailer load of pecans from Morgan Fleetwood and then sell it back to him on the sly.<br/><br/>The miscreant Fleetwood children were also in trouble, having purchased a mess of bobcats in an ill-considered scheme to use them like civets to produce gourmet coffee. They needed to pay off the bobcat suppliers and their daddy was not helping. Roscoe, desperately in lust with Destiny, agreed to help her debt problem by including them in the pecan-stealing caper, which grew and grew until the crew consisted of both Spindlehams, both Fleetwood children, and two local customers of Roscoe named Dusty and Paco.<br/><br/>Things did not go as planned.<br/><br/>The following things occurred: Propane explosion, pink-handled .38 emptied, "Mexican gangster home invasion", inept kidnapping, even more inept declarations of love, a burning pecan orchard and repeated viewings of the Tom Hanks movie Big.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353695/#Comment_353695" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-10T01:13:22+00:00" title="January 10, 2012  1:13AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Couple bits from tonight's Monsterhearts:<br/><br/>The Ghost saved the Vampire almost one hundred years prior, and they hadn't seen each other since. So when they meet, of course, they both assume that the other one is like them. They've finally met another one of their kind! "When'd you become a ghost?" the Ghost asked the Vampire. "A ghost?" the Vampire said. "I guess you could call me that."<br/><br/>So, consider the vampire's drinking blood move - 'When you feed, choose two: - heal 1 harm - carry 1 forward - they don't die.'<br/>When Chuck, one of the Vampire's food sources, helps her fight a minion of Hecate shooting it with a shotgun and then getting killed, she said, "I drink his blood!" And I thought damn, she's hard core - "Are you sure? With this monster right here?" - "Yes" - "Ok..." - "I choose <i>he doesn't die</i>." I thought that was pretty clever 'misinterpretation' of the text - so we decided that in this world, when vampires drink blood, they secrete some kind of drug at the same time to keep the victim euphoric - but it's like magic medicine, it also has restorative properties - boom, Chuck lives.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353698/#Comment_353698" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-10T02:16:37+00:00" title="January 10, 2012  2:16AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 10, 2012 2:16AM by Ben_Robbins.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>"I choose <i>he doesn't die</i>."</blockquote>\nOoooh, crafty.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353769/#Comment_353769" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-10T14:17:38+00:00" title="January 10, 2012  2:17PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "He doesn't die."<br/><br/>Brilliant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353784/#Comment_353784" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-10T15:03:20+00:00" title="January 10, 2012  3:03PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice!

There's no input from other players that has any impact on hitting/failing goals, which is bad because it causes players to drift more and more towards solo narrating scenes rather than role-playing.

Having climbed into the troll's pocket and bundled the baby mice into her cloak, she slashed an X-shaped hole in the pocket, and was preparing to throw her needle into a nearby branch (spider web rappelling line attached), when the troll spotted her and swatted a huge hand to crush her.

This was my first session of the Endgame FiascoCon.  We used the softer tilt/aftermath tables.  <br/><br/>Fiasco:  Business Casual (as yet unpublished)<br/><br/>Pablum Incorporated, recently acquired by Miyaki International, has fallen on hard times.  The CEO is hiding (and playing World of Warcraft) in an office full of (ever increasing) ferns, while his idiot son attempts to manage the layoffs mandated by Miyaki corporate.  The Director of Information Security (a former Army MP, and the CEO's raid leader in WoW) assists the son, and they manage to secure their jobs and protect their fiefdoms, at the expense of the Director of IT Support (<b>everthing</b> they do is at his expense), and to the disgust and embarrassment of the idiot son's right-hand man, a Serbian national working on an H-1 Visa. <br/><br/>The son identifies layoffs that add up to only half what was needed, by targeting the majority of IT (including the director), and by jiggering numbers to make it look like more of his sales folks are let go than actually are.  Poor Goran, the Serbian national tries like hell (at first) to get the son "promoted out" of his position for the good of the company, and (eventually) to just make sure his own job is secure, but is constantly threatened with having his visa revoked.  The IT department, trying to secure the company assets, work 48 hours straight, and are still not done before getting their pink slips.  The IT director uses the gaps that remain to infiltrate their network and publicize the financial malfeasance, managerial ineptitude, and as a bonus, a history of illegal investment activity.  <br/><br/>In the aftermath, the IT Director becomes famous as a whistleblower, and eventually hired by Miyaki International as the CTO (13 white, what can I say?), the CEO's son loses his job, and crashes and burns financially attempting to sell his book on "How Not to Run a Business", the two directors sign back onto Pablum Incorporated in menial positions only to have the company spun off by Miyaki International and eventually fail, and Goran, the Serbian national, manages to sign onto another company, doing essentially what he was doing when this all started.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354805/#Comment_354805" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-18T03:34:26+00:00" title="January 18, 2012  3:34AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The best thing about this session of Business Casual for me was a piece of paper with personnel cuts by division that kept getting passed around and adjusted.

He doesn't smoke any... no, he has the slave boy get wasted.  When a drug addict from Mao Yin's past shows up looking to trade something for a fix, it's obvious to Mao Yin that the addict is trying to foist forgeries on him.  But when the addict offers up a special amulet that can help you restore health, recover injury, and regrow limbs... Mao Yin see's an opportunity.<br/><br/>To "test the effectiveness" Mao Yin almost cuts a finger off of Kian Hwe's (stoned) slave, before the addict loses his nerve.<br/><br/>The coolest part was that the player totally got in to Mao Yin while acting out this scene.  Now he's convinced he's going to sabotage this slave to get back at Kian Hwe.  It's become a major goal of his, all because the kid was in the right scene at the right time.  <i>And we played the scene out.</i>  I'm so happy we did it!<br/><br/>Other highlights include: never having the slave trader be in any of the scenes where money changes hands... d'oh!  She's SO good at it.  Until last night, when she was able to foist off a burdensome slave for a ludicrously high price bargaining over a sword.  Who knows yet if the sword is worth anything, but the slave is out of her hair at a profit.  Sadly?  She almost regretted it.

I kept the character maps and blessings/abilities/etc, even though they had no mechanical effect.<br/><br/>Patrick's healer had his breakthrough on magical infusions used by his rival to create an army of hulking, ravenous, unruly soldiers.  When he refused to create an army for his duke to oppose them, he was exiled.  He walked the earth and was accepted by the Beast Tribes, a kind of short-lived re-incarnation believing apocalypse cult living in the outskirts, after treating a wounded tribesmen.  He quickly gained their trust with his healing skills, and was accepted as their Chieftain.  But not after inadvertently giving the key to creating more hulks to the duke's vizier, Sirius, who has spies among the tribes.<br/><br/>Abraham's cavalry trainer has been trapped in the tower of Sirius, Master of the Hunt, with his true love Cassiopeia.  He breaks free to find the cure to the wasting disease which is sapping her will to live, and which is available among the beast tribes.  Tracking through the icy wastes, him and his loyal tribesmen Crux are set upon by wolves of the Hunt, which they slay, drive off, and then use for warmth and food.  Crux asks for both wolf pelts after claiming they are speaking to him with the voices of his ancestors, that they have been trapped outside of rebirth, causing the beast tribes to slowly dwindle.<br/><br/>All in all, a good start for a shorter session, we'll probably continue next week and try to get some closure.  I'm not sure how much the arc will be affected by not having XP.

Pierce Dolland to write a transgressive lesbian unicorn erotica novel in one night, and I wish we could have seen the consequences of the ensuing obscenity trial. But the efforts of S. Philip Richards (aka "Sally"), an earnest female scientist/writer trying to gain her rightful academic credit for her work while also balancing her relationship with a co-worker with her mother's demands to set her up on a date were simply riveting to watch.<br/><br/>In Left Coast, each NPC has a secret. Here are some of them:<br/><br/>Spartan Wordes, Pierce's overwhelming-asshole of an agent, was re-writing his authors' stories so that he could slip codes into them for his communist controller.<br/><br/>Bernard Goldberg, Sally's step-father, was sleeping with his secretary. And her mum, Vera Goldberg, was being abused by Bernard.<br/><br/>Alan Williams (Sally's boyfriend) was secretly super-rich.<br/><br/>Andre Malcolm, who Sally's parents were trying to set her up with, was not - in fact - an Italian movie producer, but instead was a dirt-poor conman.<br/><br/>And Kin, who was passing on messages from the Venusians to Pierce so he could put them into his stories didn't actually know what the Venusians wanted.<br/><br/>Also, yesterday (after turning over the clues for the Weird plot I was creating in Sally's story) I figured out what was going on: Sally's brother Steve had joined a cult founded around the research that Professor Ranulph Enoch (University of Ohio, Department of Chemistry) had conducted with extremely powerful hallucinogenics he'd found on his expedition into the Brazillian rain-forests. <br/><br/>Enoch had synthesised an artificial version of the drug, which gives the people who've taken it a limited telepathic connection, and also allows them to transfer elements of their dreams into real life.<br/><br/>The sun-burned waiters who showed up at Sally's step-parents' Hollywood-soiree were cultists who'd infiltrated the wait-staff and were dosing everyone's drinks with the drug.<br/><br/><br/><br/><i>(There's a twitter account for the game, if you're interested:</i> <a href="http://twitter.com/LeftCoastRPG" rel="nofollow">@leftcoastrpg</a> <i>[/plug] )</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy" title="DeBracy"><img alt="DeBracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nTIWP6SSS5BV3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy">DeBracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355649/#Comment_355649" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-24T01:44:07+00:00" title="January 24, 2012  1:44AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2012 1:46AM by DeBracy.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Labyrinth Lord, Tower of the Wise!<br/><br/>E first played the thief R\xe4gnbj\xf6rg.

Two other PCs are my guy's grandparents, who are pragmatic scheming bastards. The final protagonist is Galina, the daughter in the fourth kommunalka family, whose pants my guy is angling to get into. We're all scraping by on 250 grams of bread a day as the city is bombed all around us by the fascist brigands.<br/><br/>The very first scene was the NKVD coming to take me back to the front (one of my edges is "pitiable" and I sure as hell used it). The second scene was granny Yuliya trying to persuade the old lady to die so we could lie that she was still alive and collect her bread ration. It didn't work, but a "next week on" highlighted some more active persuasion in episode 2.<br/><br/>I think we've all been tempered by playing Apocalypse World - it was established that this is not going to be a happy show, and the outcomes have all had a distinctly 7-9 flavor about them so far.<br/><br/><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12680153/900days.svg" rel="nofollow">Here's our R-map</a>.<br/><br/>Also:  <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/leningrad/leningrad_charsheet.pdf" rel="nofollow">Character sheet</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355880/#Comment_355880" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-25T06:56:07+00:00" title="January 25, 2012  6:56AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Jason">@Jason</a>:<br/>That game sounds awesome! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> And I have to note your ability, thus far, to delve so much into Second World history (Soviet/eastern bloc) without transforming into a) an old white guy who's been interviewed on the History Channel or b) a fervent communist. <br/>Carry on, brave son of Leningrad! <br/><br/>Also, I really need to check out PTA.

Widow Viola Stevenson, owner of the space, was dead-set on preserving her husband's vision, and spent days scowling at the scum barge that had formed just beyond her personal state's boundaries. Gaspar, who ran a heart-shaped island getaway for struggling couples, struggled with his own marriage after the peacocks broke into he and his wife's supply of love-drugs. Ruth, the lone child left on the island, spent her days staring off into sea and attempting to learn to row/sail a boat while her parents tried to save their frigid marriage with the help of Gaspar.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end, Gaspar seduced Viola towards his own ends, and to distract her ever-watchful eye while Ruth made for the scumbarge to obtain black market fertility drugs (her destiny) for Gaspar and her parents. Ruth loses her raft, and is surprised when she's pulled aboard the barge by someone speaking perfect English (Gaspar and Shelly had schooled her in the 'native' tongue). She acquires the drugs and invites the residents of the barge into New Eden.

Under the cover of regular psych evaluations, the bad guys tried to sic a memory devouring bug onto the team one by one. This did not work at all, and the first try led to the two mooks doing the job being interrogated by the team. They narrowed down the people giving the orders and decided to confront the boss. She was ready for this, and given the team's history of dealing with problems leaving very little behind she had mobilized a bunch of agents with supernatural powers as a personal bodyguard. <br/><br/>The guards, and Director O'Connell, were dealt with in a short, brutal fight. Our heroes even kept a couple of the guards alive (one because she didn't seem quite as casual about dispatching her comrades as some of the others).<br/><br/>Diane then went to O'Connell's second, who claimed to be happy to be out of it and signed the requested resignation letter. Bill used some black magic to bring O'Connell's spirit back for a bit more further interrogation. Between them they worked out that the evil plan was that O'Connell was using the agency as her personal magical research organisation, and was particularly interested in life extension.<br/><br/>Diane finished off by organising all the senior agency people, then taking over as the new Director. Our Divine, Charlie, disappeared himself after that (he's exiled from heaven, and the other angels were close to finding him).<br/><br/>And that's where we closed it off.

We're all starving, Sofiya refuses to die and he refuses to kill her, his grandson has gone from cowardly layabout to a dubious gangster-wrecker who can score Shostakovich tickets, and his old Trotsky-lovin' friend Piotr is wanted by the NKVD. We start with a glorious flashback to the collective farm days, cementing the deep bond between Piotr and Dmitiri. And then throughout the whole episode the screws get turned, he harbors Piotr and his grandson kicks him out, the Party-loyalist neighbors threaten him, it just gets more and more awful for Dmitri. <br/><br/>In the end Piotr shows up, begging for shelter at meal time in front of all four families in the Kommunalka, Dmitri tries to hide him but his gangster grandson outs Piotr when the NKVD come. Dmitri, unwilling to cut loose his old friend, tries to bribe the NKVD with ration coupons. They take both men away.<br/><br/>The next and final scene, brilliantly framed by our Producer, Robo: It's 1917, Piotr and Dmitri are outside the Winter palace with rifles, getting ready to fire into the Tsar's police line. "Shoot, Dmitri!" Piotr cries. Then it resolves to the present, Dmitri's holding a rifle, the NKVD have given him the choice of killing his friend or joining him in death. He chooses death.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ethan%20K." title="Ethan K."><img alt="Ethan K." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2475/3619178655_cd765940c5_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ethan%20K.">Ethan K.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357153/#Comment_357153" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-01T10:09:37+00:00" title="February  1, 2012 10:09AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>The next and final scene, brilliantly framed by our Producer, Robo: It's 1917, Piotr and Dmitri are outside the Winter palace with rifles, getting ready to fire into the Tsar's police line.
