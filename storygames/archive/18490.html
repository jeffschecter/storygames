If I read it coming from AW, I know what moves are originally supposed to be and I can see that notion hidden between the lines. However, if I read it coming from your average D&amp;D background, it looks like just another "roll-to-see-if-you-make-it" in which moves are just not another name for class features. For example, a GM that understands how moves are triggered by the players' actions will keep them informed of how and when this or that monster is aware of their PCs so that the players can knowingly trigger Hack'n Slash. On the other hand, your traditional DM will wait for the players to possibly trigger the move and only then will decide if the enemy is aware of them for it to actually be Hack'n Slash (or just roll for damage).<br/><br/>Following this example, is the game suppose to turn into a sneak'n stab kind of dungeon crawl where you walk in the shadows laying all manner of traps and devices so that you can avoid triggering the moves and just get to roll for damage?

If you're playing Dungeon World properly then nobody's waiting for anything. The fiction is happening and players or doing something or you're making moves to make them do something. I just don't get where this awareness thing is playing into the situation.<br/><br/>Do you mean a scenario like:<br/><br/>GM: Corum, what are you doing?<br/>Corum: I'm checking to see if the monster is aware of me.<br/>GM: Okay, how are you doing that?<br/>Corum: Uhh, well I guess I'm going to warily sneak by but be on guard in case it jumps at me.<br/>GM: Alright, then roll to defy danger as you slink past the beast.<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>GM: Corum, what are you doing?<br/>Corum: I don't know, is it aware of me?<br/>GM: If it is, it's certainly not doing anything about it, is it. At least not right at this instant anyway...<br/>Corum: Alright, well I'm going to whip out my bow and and loose an arrow in throat, don't want it making any noise.<br/>GM: Alright, looks like you're calling your shot, have at it.<br/><br/>Even if they wanted to do the whole dungeon crawl as silent assassins, it seems to be there'd still be, at the very least, some Defy Danger moves involved (re: being spotted, sneaking past monsters in their homes, getting by traps you don't know exist, etc.) As a GM you're following your principles, i.e. to fill the characters lives with adventure so yeah, you're going to want to keep throwing dangerous and difficult challenges at them. If it was a players intent to slip by unnoticed I wouldn't take away their player agency, I'd just make it a tense and challenging right to achieve it - just like I would any other intent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416167/#Comment_416167" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-13T09:03:44+00:00" title="June 13, 2013  9:03AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your question makes sense to me, Ricardo, and my answer would be:<br/><br/>Definitely play it "the AW way".

My group had trouble with this too. <br/><br/>I think the answer is that you <b>must</b> remember the GM Moves. I think the conventional D&amp;D expectation is that the GM narrates in a kind of free form way, but only the players make mechanical decisions or "moves." That is <b>not</b> how DW works. The GM moves are <b>required</b> in order for the system to work well. GM moves are not merely general advice -- they are rules. <br/><br/>So, while the traditional DM in your example "will wait for the players to possibly trigger the move." The DW GM is much more active. There is no waiting:<br/><br/>1) The procedure begins when the GM <b>makes a soft GM move</b> (they are described in the book) and then says "what do you do?"<br/><br/>2) The player then responds with his character's fictional reaction. <br/><br/>2a) If the player's fictional reaction ignores danger, the GM may make a <b>hard move</b> as described in the book. <br/><br/>2b) If the player's fictional reaction triggers a <b>player move</b>, proceed according to the player move instructions. <br/><br/>2c) If the player's fictional reaction does not ignore danger or trigger a player move, proceed to 3. <br/><br/>3) Repeat procedure. <br/><br/>So, in your example about getting spotted by a guard, it would go like this: <br/>1) the GM might say, "you see a castle guard looking for you nearby with a loaded crossbow. You are still hidden, but if you get any closer you'll be in earshot and he'll probably notice strange noises. If you stay where you are, he'll find you. What do you do?" (The GM soft move in that case was "show signs of doom")<br/><br/>2a) If the player says: "I walk right by him whistling." The GM should probably make it clear that such an action would result in getting shot with a crossbow -- if that's really what the character wants to do though, the GM can deal the crossbow damage (hard move). <br/><br/>2b) If the player says: "I sneak by him," that's probably Defy Danger -- so, you roll the dice and do what the move says to do. <br/><br/>2c) If the player says: "I back away while I'm still out of earshot and walk the other direction," then the GM proceeds to 3) and makes a new soft move: "you turn the corner and walk right into a second guard, he looks right in your face and is momentarily surprised -- he seems like he is about to shout and grab you, what do you do?!<br/><br/>3) Repeat procedure.                              </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares" title="Ricardo Tavares"><img alt="Ricardo Tavares" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/695/nIETVNBV4ZU51.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares">Ricardo Tavares</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416173/#Comment_416173" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-13T10:08:58+00:00" title="June 13, 2013 10:08AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You can play the game a number of different ways (like any game), but I think it's more effective when you play it "the AW way" rather than just assuming it's like 3E or whatever.</blockquote>People who assume it's like 3.x will still think it's new and different as they will notice that the DM chooses initiative instead of rolling for it and that you gain XP for failing tests. However, they will see it as a trade-off because they might get the impression that you want to avoid going for the dice as much as possible.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it seems to me that, in AW, moves are based much more on intent and not on circumstances that are outside of the character's control.

It does help somewhat, although it becomes a matter of narrative control as the players may try to frame the scene in a way that's favorable to them before the GM gets to slap them around with soft moves <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> A classic example is staging a distraction so that the guards are not there or can be easily killed.

If not, what is the advantage of defy danger over hack and slash?</blockquote>\nJust to add another two cents, my understanding is also that this depends heavily on fictional positioning:<br/><br/>Just how scary is this Owlbear? Is it huge and overpowering, does it have greater reach than the PC?<br/><br/>How armed and prepared is the PC? Are they already in position to just fight like that, or do they need to do something else first?<br/><br/>I think that if the PC and the Owlbear were facing each other, weapons drawn, it would be totally legit to answer an attack from the Owlbear with a Hack &amp; Slash roll.<br/><br/>But if the Owlbear had twice the reach of the PC, they would need to get within range first, so Hack &amp; Slash wouldn't be an option just yet.<br/><br/>Similarly, if the PC didn't have their sword drawn, or was caught off-guard, or was busy doing something else (trying to untie a trapped prisoner, say), then Defy Danger would be the more likely choice.<br/><br/>As you can see, it heavily depends on the group to reach consensus over how the fiction is flowing and what's happening, in detail.<br/><br/>Dungeon World is not a game which will tell you, by rules, exactly which moves apply at which given point.

Ie., once you get rolling, like a snowball on a hill, things just tend to get bigger and bigger---either PCs get in more and more trouble, or they're acting on a bigger and bigger scale. Either way is bad ass and fun. When I play AW, I find that my players often expend a lot of energy on figuring out ways to avoid rolling the dice, so they can minimize their risk. That's okay by me, because no matter what they do, I'm still going to get Golden Opportunities to make their lives interesting.

So, as <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> noted above, I suppose there could be circumstances to support a variety of moves.<br/><br/>In the heat of the moment though (assuming the player is squaring off with an Owl Bear that he can potentially hit and harm), if a player said that to me, I'd have probably deemed the "duck and plunge" maneuver to be a trigger for Hack&amp;Slash. I would not have considered the good ol' "duck and plunge" to be two different player moves. Avoiding an attack while you put yourself in position to make an attack of your own <b>is</b> Hack&amp;Slash -- that's literally what the move does. <br/><br/> <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares" title="Ricardo Tavares"><img alt="Ricardo Tavares" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/695/nIETVNBV4ZU51.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares">Ricardo Tavares</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416278/#Comment_416278" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-14T09:18:02+00:00" title="June 14, 2013  9:18AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2013 9:19AM by Ricardo Tavares.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can see players trying to Spout Lore, Parley and Discern Realities as much as they can in order to find a way to position themselves within the fiction that gets them to roll for damage without the need to Hack'n Slash, Voley or Defy Danger.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elmago79" title="elmago79"><img alt="elmago79" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i44.photobucket.com/albums/f41/doguiii/rdh12.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elmago79">elmago79</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416286/#Comment_416286" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-14T10:35:27+00:00" title="June 14, 2013 10:35AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, but if they fail those rolls they may have to do so anyway, and at a disadvantage, or even take damage themselves.

Rolling a 6 is bad no matter what the move is. The only reason Hack&amp;Slash is arguably more dangerous than other moves is because you take damage on 7-9. But, a) 7-9 can be problematic on other moves too; and, b) if I have a +2 on my Hack&amp;Slash and a -1 on my Defy Danger, Hack&amp;Slash is still probably the "safer" move. Moreover, all things equal, jumping around in front of an Owl Bear might be less risky than stabbing it, but jumping around probably isn't doing anything to remove your angry Owl Bear problem. While it's certainly possible to play in a way that intentionally avoids rolling Hack&amp;Slash, avoiding Hack&amp;Slash at all costs isn't inherently optimal. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short" title="Lee_Short"><img alt="Lee_Short" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short">Lee_Short</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416325/#Comment_416325" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-14T18:32:44+00:00" title="June 14, 2013  6:32PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If a player makes a player move, the move dictates what happens. <br/><br/>If the player responds to the angry owlbear with an answering attack, it's probably Hack&amp;Slash so on a 10+ you avoid its attack and deal your damage; on a 7-9 you'd trade damage.

Continuing with the Owlbear example, let's say the PCs are back in town, trying to find out all they can about Owlbears before they trek off into the forest to face one. The Wizard <b>Spouts Lore</b> while searching through the library of the town's College of Magic, but rolls a 6. The PCs are currently nowhere near the Owlbear. They're safe and sound behind the thick wooden walls of the town where nothing can happen, right?<br/><br/>Wrong. Obviously the GM isn't going to narrate an angry Owlbear busting through the library's door to attack the Wizard (although that would be kind of awesome). Instead, the GM is going to make another move. Maybe the GM will <b>Reveal an unwelcome truth</b>. Turns out this particular species of Owlbear can only be harmed by magical weapons, which the party doesn't currently have. Or maybe these Owlbears form breeding colonies, meaning that there's not one monster, but a whole bunch of them. Maybe the GM will <b>Use up their resources</b>. The College of Magic's library is horribly unorganized. It's going to take at least three days to go through everything to find useful information. Or maybe this is the last favor the Wizard can get from the College of Magic for a while, since the PCs have already asked for so much. Maybe the GM will Turn their move back on them. There's another bad of adventurers in town, and they've already armed themselves with Owlbear knowledge. They're all ready to head off into the forest to deal with the menace, stealing the glory (and the gold) from the PCs.<br/><br/>The point is, there is nowhere the PCs can "hide" from the GMs Moves. If they make a Move, and there needs to be a consequence, then there is one, regardless of where the PCs are. Sometimes you'll have to be creative about what happens, but something needs to happen. If there is absolutely nothing that can possibly happen as a result of the characters messing up, then it's not a Move. There's no need to roll dice, and whatever the characters are trying to make happen just happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416345/#Comment_416345" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-15T07:59:30+00:00" title="June 15, 2013  7:59AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Thanks all for answering my newb question, and also I apologize for threadjacking. <br/><br/>But what if, in response to the owlbear question above, the players says, "I quickly duck underneath the owlbear's reach and plunge my dagger into its belly?"

Ask more questions, establish more details, and use your judgements (as MC, and as a group): just how fraught with danger is this situation? Is the Owlbear quick and furious? Does it have the drop on the PC, or was the PC prepared to react? Is the PC someone who could believably just coolly duck and lunge like that? (It's D&amp;D and you're a fan of the characters, so probably yes, but not if this is in the dark, the floor is slick with blood, and the character is off-balance or terrified already...)<br/><br/>That's what I was trying to get at in my previous post.

While this scenario didn't <i>exactly</i> happen to me, in a DW game I GMed the players kept withdrawing from dungeons to places of safety and it became exhausting for me to come up with ways to make moves. The point of the game mostly taking place in a dungeon is to give the GM lots of context to work from when they need to make moves. I think that there's an implicit player agenda in DW where the players need to play characters who want to explore dungeons. If the players are trying to "outsmart" the mechanics, the game isn't going to work. It's not possible to be a fan of the characters if they're doing stuff that's boring to you (the "be a fan" principle isn't an obligation to enjoy whatever the player contributes). Yes, to a certain extent there's a self-correcting cycle in the game where people are supposed to realize that hiding from the mechanics can actually expose them to more hard moves than just playing the game, but that mechanism isn't strong enough to convince a safety-obsessed character to be an adventurer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416358/#Comment_416358" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-15T10:27:55+00:00" title="June 15, 2013 10:27AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dan,<br/><br/>I haven't run DW myself, but shouldn't the "safety-seeking" characters cause the various Fronts to advance until they intersect with the characters?<br/><br/>For instance, if the characters are boarded up in some house up the hill from the village, shouldn't some Orcs attack and burn the village sooner or later (and so the MC's move might be "You see smoke from the window"), a plague fall across the land, the dead rise from the grave, etc?<br/><br/>If that's not how it's supposed to work, do you think it would solve the problem or not?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416361/#Comment_416361" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-15T10:44:28+00:00" title="June 15, 2013 10:44AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I haven't run DW myself, but shouldn't the "safety-seeking" characters cause the various Fronts to advance until they intersect with the characters?<br/><br/>For instance, if the characters are boarded up in some house up the hill from the village, shouldn't some Orcs attack and burn the village sooner or later (and so the MC's move might be "You see smoke from the window"), a plague fall across the land, the dead rise from the grave, etc?<br/><br/>If that's not how it's supposed to work, do you think it would solve the problem or not?</blockquote>\nFor me, doing nothing but constant escalation became exhausting. Burning towns down around PCs is not what I wanted to get from Dungeon World, I wanted to get a game about adventurers in dungeons. Turning the places of safety into de facto dungeons because the players didn't want to engage with the actual dungeons was not fun for me, even though I theoretically could have continued going through the motions of playing by doing that. If the players' response to escalation is to seek safety, then escalating when they seek safety doesn't seem like an especially healthy cycle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416363/#Comment_416363" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-15T10:50:14+00:00" title="June 15, 2013 10:50AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, that's the default mode in Apocalypse World (the world is a dangerous place) as well as in a lot of fantasy fiction (the heroes try to seek safety, but inevitably some kind of urgent and present danger drives them to action - danger always finds them if they don't seek it first).<br/><br/>I'd say that if you're going to a more typical "safe in Town -&gt; dangerous in the Dungeon" D&amp;D-adventure, you can't use the regular DW rules outside of the adventure location itself.

So what do you see as the cause, and how might it be treated?</blockquote>\nI think the root cause is one of player alignment/stance toward the game. DW does a good job of aligning the GM via the agendas, principles, and always-says, but leaves players to mostly intuit things for themselves. For the game to function well the players also have to embrace the game, e.g. they're playing characters who want to explore dungeons and they aren't trepidatious about engaging with either the fictional or mechanical parts of the game. (A technique-based way for a GM to guide things in that direction might be to ask players as part of chargen why they're living an adventurer lifestyle rather than leading a safe, boring life, and maybe end each session by asking whether each character wants to continue their adventuring lifestyle or is thinking about retiring.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares" title="Ricardo Tavares"><img alt="Ricardo Tavares" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/695/nIETVNBV4ZU51.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares">Ricardo Tavares</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416400/#Comment_416400" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-16T02:23:40+00:00" title="June 16, 2013  2:23AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the game leans in favor of the heroic and clear-cut "you see him, he sees you, fight!" than the dark and gritty hide in shadows approach.

Go Aggro is triggered when you're using violence of the threat of violence to control behavior. SbF is triggered when you're exchanging blows directly. You could plan your way around these two moves to inflict damage from a place of safety if the MC was maintaining as loose a hold on the fiction as your DW example implies. I think the real difference lies in the fact the in DW the primary objective is known beforehand, delving the dungeon, while in AW the story unfolds solely from the interactions of the characters with the world and the MC's questions and proddings. So, it's harder to try to tip toe around the obstacles, since you create them while your tip toeing.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416424/#Comment_416424" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-16T13:24:28+00:00" title="June 16, 2013  1:24PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the "invulnerable dragon" and "attacking helpless victims" corner-cases tend to cast too big a shadow over this. The common case is that monsters are both dangerous and vulnerable to the equally dangerous PCs. That means that Hack &amp; Slash is the move you'll almost always be using when PCs are trying to hurt monsters. Hack &amp; Slash is indeed risky, but you can also say that the best defense is a good offense, so engaging a beatable monster in combat may be lower long-term risk. If a player thinks that one of their goals in play is to avoid using the Hack &amp; Slash move they are wrong and confused about how to play this game. Hack &amp; Slash is not a bad or stupid move. If a PC is trying to hurt a monster in a combat, it's Hack &amp; Slash. It's almost never some weird contingent "First you Defy Danger, <i>then</i> you Hack &amp; Slash" thing. Mechanically contingent moves are rare in *W games. If what they're trying to do is get out of the way and avoid engaging the dangerous monster, that's probably Defy Danger. If they're trying to fight the monster it's probably Hack&amp;Slash.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416426/#Comment_416426" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-16T13:45:45+00:00" title="June 16, 2013  1:45PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suppose the "try to avoid having to Hack and Slash" comes more from my readings of Monster of the Week, where it is a fundamentally dicey idea to try to Kick Some Ass. The game explicitly recommends that hunters find ways to attack the monster that don't involve triggering that move.

In <i>MotW</i> the Hunters can only defeat the monster if they exploit its weakness. Running in and just trying to <b>Kick Some Ass</b> without setting things up first is a bad idea. Plus, when you <b>Kick Some Ass</b>, the Hunter is pretty much <i>always</i> going to take damage (they just might take 1-harm less on a 10+ of they choose that option, or they might not suffer damage if the Keeper makes a different move).<br/><br/><i>DW</i> <b>Hack &amp; Slash</b> doesn't work that way though. Getting a 10+ on a <b>Hack &amp; Slash</b> allows the character to avoid taking damage (unless they choose to deal extra damage). So <b>Hack &amp; Slash</b> is, mechanically, safer than <b>Kick Some Ass</b>. So in <i>MotW</i> you want to find a way to outsmart the monster, or get it in a position where you don't have to <b>Kick Some Ass</b> because you're almost guaranteed to get hurt. That isn't always the case in <i>DW</i>. If you're a skilled enough combatant (meaning you can get 10+ results on <b>Hack &amp; Slash</b> fairly often), you won't get too banged up when fighting monsters, and so you don't really need to spend hours finding a way to deal with the monsters outside of combat.<br/><br/>All that being said, if the characters <i>do</i> want to find ways of handling monsters without resorting to combat, that's fine too. The moves will kick in based on what they're doing in the fiction, just like any other <i>AW</i>-based game, and things will snowball.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416434/#Comment_416434" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-16T18:36:35+00:00" title="June 16, 2013  6:36PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a very interesting but subtle distinction that does a lot.

I've had numerous occasions in my AW games where harm gets dealt by PCs without it being Seizing By Force or Going Aggro. In fact, probably more often than either of them. I mean, you're right, there's no escaping the web of moves, because every time the MC/GM says something it should be a move, but it's damned easy to go a session without doing anything that triggers a player move. It just gets kinda lame, and with the moves all being MC/GM moves the PCs aren't really doing anything to relieve the pressure. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares" title="Ricardo Tavares"><img alt="Ricardo Tavares" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/695/nIETVNBV4ZU51.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares">Ricardo Tavares</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416452/#Comment_416452" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-17T01:59:16+00:00" title="June 17, 2013  1:59AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Go Aggro is triggered when you're using violence of the threat of violence to control behavior.

Usually there's going to be some sort of confrontation. Yelling, shoving, making a scene, stuff like that. I've never really considered it to be the "sneak and stab" move.<br/><br/>Also, and I think this is a big distinction, <i>Apocalypse World</i> isn't a class based game. <i>Dungeon World is</i>, as it's emulating the class-based game <i>D&amp;D</i>. And in <i>D&amp;D</i> the "sneak and stab" stuff is the domain of the Thief. Give everyone "sneak and stab" capabilities in the form of a Basic Move, and you've taken something away from that class. You're treading on the Thief's <b>Backstab</b> Move. Other classes can <i>try</i> to be sneaky, but they'll just won't be as good at it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares" title="Ricardo Tavares"><img alt="Ricardo Tavares" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/695/nIETVNBV4ZU51.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares">Ricardo Tavares</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416454/#Comment_416454" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-17T04:42:21+00:00" title="June 17, 2013  4:42AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I've never really considered it to be the "sneak and stab" move.</blockquote>I mean sneak'n stab as in a way of rolling to deal damage without being dealt damage in return. AW calls it a one-sided murderous act.<br/><br/>That's a good point about DW being a class based game, but Backstab is "When you attack a surprised or defenseless enemy with a melee weapon, you can choose to deal your damage" which any character can already do, but with the option of actually taking the chance of rolling for the move.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/HyveMynd" title="HyveMynd"><img alt="HyveMynd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/564/nZ3DM2UV4QM5S.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/HyveMynd">HyveMynd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416459/#Comment_416459" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-17T05:46:21+00:00" title="June 17, 2013  5:46AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I mean sneak'n stab as in a way of rolling to deal damage without being dealt damage in return.

It's the first paragraph under the <b>Hack &amp; Slash</b> Move in the book.\n<blockquote>Hack and slash is for attacking a prepared enemy plain and simple. If the enemy isn\u2019t prepared for your attack\u2014if they don\u2019t know you\u2019re there or they\u2019re restrained and helpless\u2014then that\u2019s not hack and slash. You just deal your damage or murder them outright, depending on the situation. Nasty stuff.</blockquote>\nAs you said, <i>any</i> character can do that. Even the Fighter in her big clunky, noisy platemail armor can straight up murder someone, if she's hiding around a corner and the target just starts to stroll by because they have no idea she's there. A similar situation happened in the very first <i>DW</i> game I ran. The Fighter heard the steps of a group of cultists as they ascended the wooden staircase (that was me <b>Showing signs of an approaching threat</b>) and hid behind some nearby bushes. I called for <b>Defy Danger</b>, with the danger being the cultists spotting him. The player nailed the roll, the cultists came up out of the dungeon, and had no idea there was anyone nearby. As they looked around, the Fighter bounded from cover, cutting one down before any of them could do anything. No <b>Hack &amp; Slash</b>, just "Roll your damage to see if he's dead. Yup, he is." The Wizard did the same thing later in the session. He hid around a corner with his staff at the ready, a cultist charged out of the doorway with no clue where anyone was, and CRACK! The Wizard's robes were all splattered with blood and brain jelly.<br/><br/>So there <i>is</i> a move to deal damage to a foe with no chance of being attacked back; attacking a surprised or defenseless target. <i>How</i> the characters get themselves set up for that situation is all completely on them though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416483/#Comment_416483" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-17T09:57:53+00:00" title="June 17, 2013  9:57AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>AW also says that when somebody tries to kill somebody without their fighting back, going aggro is the move.
