I'm new on the board and thought I'd might as well get right into it:<br/>\n<br/>\nThis fall, I'm GMing a campaign centered around occult and supernatural phenomena and events. The setting is urban fantasy (with emphasis on the "urban") with a nineteenth century/victorian/steampunk feel, in a world not our own - we can call it "the City".<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the idea is that all the characters are "occultists" or similar, who approach the supernatural in different ways. One might be a modern-day shaman who explores the hidden expanses of the subconcious using mind-altering drugs, Timothy Leary-style. Another might be a mad inventor cobbling together insane weird-tech gadgets. Yet another might heed the call of the magical nature of the City itself, becoming an "alleymage" who manipulates the very structure of the City to unlock its secrets. And so on. My plan is to write-up a number of "classes" for the players to choose from; each "class" a different type of occultist.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, these occultist characters will be introduced to a number of occult mysteries. The purpose will not be to "solve" these mysteries, only to scratch their surface and reveal the even bigger mysteries below, like peeling off the outermost layer of an onion. Everything will be connected in some way, but it will not be available to the players, except as hints and hunches.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo... naturally, this requires a magic system. Now, where magic is concerned, I've been thinking along these lines: magic shouldn't simply be a problem-solving tool, because the campaign - the stories - are <i>about</i> magic. and it would be lame if magic was simply a way to expediate the passage through it. So I figured, rather than being a solution, magic should be the <i>problem</i> - or, more precisely, the source of drama. I envision stories where characters start using magic (because that's what they do, being occultists and all), and that very usage pulls them further into the mysteries.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut how to codify this in rules? I don't want to have to simply decide every time a character uses magic what will happen and how this will affect the story, so I figgered I'd make the system narration-based, and let the players do the job. Here's a preliminary idea:<br/>\n<br/>\nEach adventure is designed as a "ladder", each rung of the ladder representing another revelation in the mystery. These revelations are predefined by me, the GM. However, the path whereby characters reach the revelations is left open to the players. When the adventure starts, the players are introduced to the mystery that their characters are supposed to solve, and some initial situation to get it all rolling.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, in any conflict, players can choose to use their magic. This gives them bonus dice or whatnot according to the resolution rules, but at the cost of "mystery points". Mystery points have two effects. One: they mess things up for the players, in the form of "magical backlash" - the summoned demon demands payment; escaping the cops through the shadowlands attracts the attention of some being; the drug-induced trance meant to give the characters information gives them more information than they were after, and so on. This backlash is decided by the player, and hopefully in such a way that it would be easy to tie in to Point Two, which is that when the group has accumulated some fixed amount of mystery points, they reach a new revelation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis system requires a lot of the players, and it might be a lot to ask that the players should narrate their magical backlash so that it ties in to a mystery that they don't know the explanation to. So, if you have some thoughts about how it might be improved, or if you think the whole idea is stupid and have a much better one of your own, I'd be delighted to hear it.<br/>\n<br/>\n/Kalle Bergman                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78327/#Comment_78327" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-28T06:58:32+00:00" title="June 28, 2007  6:58AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kalle, is this a system you're writing for the game?
