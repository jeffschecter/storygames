Merely, that at some point I will find a way.<br/><br/>Main Inspiration: Sector General Novels by James White.<br/><br/>Secondary: Med Ship, MASH, Babylon 5, ER, St. Elsewhere.<br/><br/>Now a huge note: Sector General being written by an Irish man who lived through the troubles of Catholic/Protestant violence and more, the books were non-violent, almost completely so. It would be a very different game. <br/><br/>The need for a skill system that creates medical drama, divides medical skills finely, and has no violence is a challenge. Well, maybe I'll be inspired some day. Anyone have suggestions?

The game starts with the creation of a relationship map. There are dice but these decide on elements to be included in conflict resolution, not the outcome of the conflict itself which is decided by the player (there are also Graham based mechanics as I wrote it for him). Two of the dice have set elements but the third is created at the start of the game by the players and is colour specific, depending on what kind of game they're playing. We played it once and it seemed to work.<br/><br/>What kind of conflict occurs in Sector General? I've only read one story. It was something about being attracted to weird aliens a surgeon was operating on. The solution to the problem was to put a buxom nurse on the staff to keep his mind off the alien.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/%5BDeleted%20User%5D" title="[Deleted User]"><img alt="[Deleted User]" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/%5BDeleted%20User%5D">[Deleted User]</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354445/#Comment_354445" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-16T04:50:55+00:00" title="January 16, 2012  4:50AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 19, 2012 5:40AM by [Deleted User].">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For inspiration I recommend reading Stardoc by S.L.

You get to solve conflicts dramatically without having to really worry about specific skills, and losing a conflict is usually even more interesting than winning one.

Individual patients or species? Looking at vaccination the problem of the individual can be solved by treating everyone but looking at antibiotics the solution for the individual is the problem for everyone (drug resistance). One of the greatest medical inventions in the history of humanity is water toilets. Also not living in poverty (except for polio where living in poverty protects you). In general practice 95% of diagnosis is made through anamnesis (as one of my professors said on a lecture today: when you start taking tests you open the gateway to hell and when you're in hell the only way out is deeper in). When talking to an alien species they might have vastly different views on what causes their disease so that tool is out. While folklore is sometimes good you should never underestimate how retarded and dangerous some lore is. I read about one stone age level tribe in south america who equated health to a good appetite and the anthropologist spoke with a man who was feeling sick and was terrified because his appetite was gone. His solution was eating as much as he could and a few days later he died (was constipated) and the tribe thought it was very strange that he died so suddenly, he had been eating so well!<br/><br/>Medical care, especially intensive care and trauma care, involves a great deal of violence directed towards a patient. A proper CPR should break a few ribs: if the patient is old and frail is will break all the ribs which is why the choice to not resussitate old patients is made: saving their life will only postpone their death a few days at most at the cost of great suffering for the patient. X-rays give cancer and can give permanent brain damage to children. Endoscopy is unpleasant and carries a small risk of injury. All surgery carries risks in form of infection and being put to sleep is also dangerous especially if you're already sick. Some surgeries risk other forms of permanent damage such a severed nerves (hoarse voice a complication of thyroid surgery, mastectomy risks giving "angel wings" that is protruding scapula). Even every day pain killers bought over counter (NSAID) can cause hidden but lethal hemorrhage or kidney failure.<br/><br/>What tone is that book? If you want a pessimistic classic (on which Scrubs is based) I recommend The House of God.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354751/#Comment_354751" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T16:07:30+00:00" title="January 17, 2012  4:07PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about playing your game using Primetime Adventures or as a playset for Fiasco?

That, I think, works best for anything where you need to investigate something, solve problems, and still have a little bit of everything else. Use the combat mechanics to represent, instead of actual combat, interdepartmental or administerial red-tape and other such conflicts. The young, up-and-coming doctor butting heads with the head of surgery, or the somewhat unconventional genius doctor working his way around the draconian systems of the otherwise conservative hospital administration.<br/><br/>Also, for further reading (I don't think I saw this listed), the Star Trek graphic novel of <i>Leonard McCoy: Frontier Doctor</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion" title="Silverlion"><img alt="Silverlion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/943/nF5ZRHUHC8M5A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion">Silverlion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354942/#Comment_354942" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-19T07:36:37+00:00" title="January 19, 2012  7:36AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good stuff to consider thanks gentlefolk. <br/><br/>GBSteve: The story had issues with him because he had trouble relating to his own species, which psychologically speaking was a problem, since he may be called to treat humans. As well as the fact they used tapes of knowledge that carried a strong psychological "copy" of the person they took it from, so they could diagnose nigh every species. The nurse later pathologist was also isolating and O'mara the Chief psychologist of the station liked to meddle (and is very good at it.)<br/><br/>I think a few of my players would truly enjoy this type of game, not being the sociopath-violent sorts. One I know wouldn't, but we'll see about leaving him out, or finding a way to appeal to him. He might adapt.<br/><br/>As for Gumshoe: I don't see it working different enough in terms of games to change the basic axioms of play as it still relies a bit to much on the GM putting information out there. (As a GM, I tend to let the players lead in mysteries--they want to investigate X, then X is likely to give them something--even if showing them Y is the real choice.)<br/><br/>I've read Stardoc by the way, as well as a few others that don't immediately come to mind.

Sometimes they can save patients, sometimes they can't. That's not the issue in MASH, the issue is the army wants to do something stupid, and one doctor won't go along with it and the others that try get themselves in knots.<br/><br/>The conflict in House is not doctors versus disease, it's doctors versus the unknown.  The patient is lying, the tests are misleading, things are getting worse, faster than they expected.  For House-a-likes, investigative games like Gumshoe might be a good fit.<br/><br/>I think the key element to making the game work is identifying what is really going on.  Since you're not a space doctor, you won't be Accurately Portraying Medical Decisionmaking.  Instead, you should identify what the real conflict is and how the medical stuff feeds into/reinforces that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354971/#Comment_354971" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-19T11:28:16+00:00" title="January 19, 2012 11:28AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's been years since I've read them, but my memory of the classic Sector General story was: alien we've never heard of before shows up.

And the writer had some really innovative ideas around aliens and what could go wrong with them.  Maybe make a point of splitting the alien creation around the players so that you can get both buy in and a sense of mystery?  What I mean is - get the players to write down component ideas individually and pass them to you to use, so they won't know what's going to be used in the game.  And split the skill set between Diagnosis, Surgery and Medicine?<br/><br/>Although I also remember the Sector General stories for White's immense well of chauvinism.  It dates them quite a lot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356243/#Comment_356243" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-27T07:50:36+00:00" title="January 27, 2012  7:50AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I have not read the books, but I suggest that if you're already looking at ER as secondary inspiration, you think about its story structure. Crucially, I don't think that the medical element of ER is <em>all that important.</em> It is at best an intrusive backdrop. You could just as easily plant the same characters on a covered wagon on the Oregon Trail and you'd have the same stories.</p>\n<p>That's because they are about personal drama, on a small scale, exacerbated by medical issues. Maybe Qtang needs more money for his department but the admins don't think it's worth it. That's an ongoing problem, and you bring it to a head by <em>turning that problem into a patient:</em> someone is brought into Qtang's department and they <em>cannot afford to treat him.</em> He will die if the department doesn't get its funding. If he dies, that's ok; that just means that some dude died, and the department is decisively not getting that money for some time.</p>\n<p>Now you feed this into another problem: Qtang fires one of his doctors so he can afford supplies, and gets in trouble because that doctor was the director's ... alien relative of some kind ... and so now the board is gunning for HIS job.</p>\n<p>That's what ER (and for that matter House) look like to me anyway.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion" title="Silverlion"><img alt="Silverlion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/943/nF5ZRHUHC8M5A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion">Silverlion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356375/#Comment_356375" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-27T16:03:02+00:00" title="January 27, 2012  4:03PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stephanie: Yeah, he did improve on that over the years. His chauvenism. Its another "different age, different standards" kind of thing that crops up. Albeit he never entirely let it go. ("Nurse" Murchison became Pathologist, but never could use the alien brain tapes because women were too stubborn, apparently--or rather "do solid with their own identities." Or something.)  I'm going to avoid that. I think its silly, and I come from a different age where I damn well know women who are smarter/stronger/more capable than me.<br/><br/>Shreyas: I think ER fits the mold, but not house. House is a medical Sherlock Holmes, and is "right!" Most of the time, but not before messing things up because of his crappy social behavior and inability to accept he might sometimes be wrong. <br/><br/>Still good stuff to look at: How the drama works, and can be used to convey the setting and themes of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
