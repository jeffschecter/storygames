Though, like Andy's example, they were all Japanese. One specifically was about traders and merchants in a fantasy world with airships, while another was almost entirely centered around school life (though I think it was more of a comedy/drama game...it was too much of a pain in the ass to translate at the time).<br/><br/>To me, the entire reason to play a game is to do something I wouldn't normally experience in real life. Adventure, exploits, danger, mystery, etc. Slice-of-life games are, however, conceptually interesting to me.

There are some games that involve ordinary people, but these tend to involve them doing rather extraordinary things (Fiasco and Ribbon Drive come to mind here).<br/><br/>Yuuyake Koyake and (from what Andy's posted) Families both put some emphasis on ordinary people (to different degrees and in different ways) but also have a sort of "mission" structure to them. There's a problem, and you're going to go and solve it, and the game delineates what resources your character has. There's also another Japanese RPG called Aitsu wa Classmate! ("That's My Classmate!"), which is about students in a highly manga-fied but otherwise realistic Japanese high school (your otaku character might have a maid as an imaginary friend, but there's no supernatural elements to the game), which also has the PCs are troubleshooters.<br/><br/>I think the real challenge for designing an RPG about something like everyday life is how to go about making a game that relates to that kind of role-playing and helps create an engaging experience, despite taking up subject matter that basically runs against the grain of the majority of RPGs ever made. That's been a major struggle in my attempts at an Azumanga Daioh type game, since (as I realized only after writing a complete first draft of the game) the source material really doesn't involve problem-solving, and success and failure are not so common or interesting as to need game mechanics to determine which you get. I'm kind of hoping this kind of thing gets a bit more developed, both because I find these kinds of things intriguing, and because I think it could help inform the human side of some more fantastical games. The Jeepform and <a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Norwegian Style</a> games point to a lot of interesting possibilities along these lines.<br/><br/>Thematically, a whole lot of that stuff still involve some amount of escapism. Yuuyake Koyake has its idyllic countryside setting, and my goal for an Azumanga Daioh type game is to come up with something that produces silly, heartwarming stories about high school friendships. Aitsu wa Classmate! specifically bills itself as being a game about "the high school life you wish you'd had."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_311319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311319/#Comment_311319" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-06T02:28:02+00:00" title="February  6, 2011  2:28AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 6, 2011 2:35AM by TomasHVM.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: whduryea</cite>Is there a reason for this?</blockquote>If you look to films, a relatively young form of art, the films of its "infancy" where quite primitive; short news-reels, curiosa, slapstick and such.

I think when many people imagine a game about mundane life, they imagine an RPG about filling the dishwasher. But, really, there are a lot of small moments of drama and crisis in daily life, and role-playing a life distinctly different from our own--but not exaggerated, sensationalized or fantastical--could allow us the experience and enjoy that drama.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neko Ewen</cite><a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Norwegian Style</a></blockquote>\nThanks for the link.

Sci-fi, spy thrillers, rom coms, fantasy epics, and police dramas dominate the major release schedule. Even looking at this year's Best Picture nominees, you have a revenge western, a science fiction espionage thriller, a film about talking toys. Meanwhile, most of the nominees set in more mundane settings deal with hugely influential people (kings, internet billionaires), or life threatening situations (<i>127 Hours</i>, <i>Winter's Bone</i>). That's not to say these are bad movies. I've seen most of them, and they are very good. But they aren't about average people in engaging but unexceptional circumstances.

I think we are really on the verge of a revolution in this sort of game design. I think that jeepform and a the new generation of indie games--while not embracing this kind of material--have opened the way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311323/#Comment_311323" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-06T07:08:21+00:00" title="February  6, 2011  7:08AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Norwegian Style is a great start. <br/><br/>A lot of games have a dial you can willingly set toward a more prosaic experience by consensus.

I said: "I believe we will find that there is absolutely no theme too mundane." Lo and behold; I have done my best to fulfill this prophesy already! In the <i>Norwegian Style</i> anthology my first ever role-playing poem is translated into English; "<i>Stoke Birmingham 0-0</i>". It is indeed a mundane game, thematizing dull soccer-fans having watched a dull match, and then experiencing a dull moment at the pub after the match. First time I tried it was my longest 15 minutes ever! All of us got so <i>gloomy</i> in body and mind by playing it, as if a great weight was laid on our shoulders.

Personally, the one I'm looking for next, in the mundane category, is a game that can handle "the Great American novel": Gatsby, To Kill a Mockingbird, Catcher in the Rye, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311333/#Comment_311333" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-06T08:56:01+00:00" title="February  6, 2011  8:56AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: whduryea</cite>Have you made<i>Stoke Birmingham 0-0</i>available online?</blockquote>\n<a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2007/12/07/stoke-birmingham-0-0/" rel="nofollow">It's available on the Norwegian Style blog here</a>.<br/><br/>It's been quite a while (and I still need to rope some friends into trying it out), but since neither I nor anyone I know knows anything about soccer/football, I made <a href="http://yarukizero.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/monday-afternoon-blues.pdf" rel="nofollow">Monday Afternoon Blues</a>, which works almost exactly the same as Stoke Birmingham 0-0, only it's about the aftermath of an exhausting anime convention.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311339/#Comment_311339" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-06T09:28:53+00:00" title="February  6, 2011  9:28AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does something like <a>Nicotine Girls</a> count as mundane?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311340/#Comment_311340" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-06T09:33:57+00:00" title="February  6, 2011  9:33AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't see why mundane has to equal boring or tedious.

And still you are wrong in two poignant ways:<br/><br/>1 - We don't have to set these things up against each other. We may design and play whatever we like. Or; whatever <i>someone</i> may possibly like. A tradition not constantly evolving into new versions of itself, expanding, including new generations, is dead.<br/><br/>2 - We may look outside the realm of "players". Look to ordinary people, those taken in with <i>Eastenders</i> or <i>Home and Away</i> and other series/books/films like that. Whatever we believe; fantasy is not the big thing outside our meager realm of game-play. The "eastenders" of the world may find it more interesting to play games closer to their heart and life. ;-)<br/><br/>The last years I have tired of these "players". To be stiff-necked about everything new or slightly challenging, is a stance that seem too common amongst them. This is especially true when <i>discussing</i> role-playing games. There seem to be no end to our procrastination when new ways of playing are proposed. As if all have been done already, in the world of gaming! LOL<br/><br/>In the real world, though, face to face over the table, I find most players (99 in 100) to be fun to play with. And full of joy over new tricks. Some of them even get that faraway look in their eyes, after some really modern type game-play, due to it bringing back the days when role-playing was new to them. I really love those moments!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311388/#Comment_311388" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-07T01:09:49+00:00" title="February  7, 2011  1:09AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2011 1:10AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.

I mean, check it out:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: whduryea</cite>It seems most RPGs, even within the indie sphere, tend to focus on the dramatic and the profound: war, death, murder, zombie apocalypses, etc.<br/><br/>Even jeepform games, which often utilize contemporary domestic settings tend to skew towards the sensational, often focusing on humiliation ("Fatmandown") or violence and abuse ("Gang Rape," "The Mother").<br/><br/>Is there a reason for this? Does focusing on the mundane leave most players disinterested?</blockquote>\nIt's an interesting topic for discussion: I don't know for sure whether the observed predominance of games with sensational/fantastic elements indicates that most players are disinterested in playing a game that is 100% mundane, but I think it certainly suggests that they are <i>less</i> interested.  And if you're only sitting down to game once every couple of weeks, you might very well never get around to playing an entirely mundane game.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>Lets forget that point now, and move on to more fruitful fields of discussion, directly related to the design and effects of games with mundane themes.</blockquote>\nIf you've got something to say along those lines, feel free; I'll bow out of game design questions, since I'm not a game designer (and this isn't a game design thread), but I'd be interested to read whatever you've got to say about how you "sell" an entirely mundane game to players, or how you keep a mundane game session from crossing the line into sensational/"unrealistic" fiction, or anything like that.

It usually arises when I'm trying to get a friend or acquaintance who I think, based on their other interests, would like RPGs to try a more traditional game, like D&amp;D or one of the White Wolf titles. This was a problem that came up several times before I discovered indie games or started playing around with my own designs. For awhile I was contaminated by the idea that D&amp;D was somehow the ideal starter RPG, just because it is what I (and most of the other role-players I know) started with.<br/><br/>Lately, I've been able to hook a few nontraditional gamers--including my SO, who enjoys acting, but wouldn't touch D&amp;D--by starting them with games that didn't immediately demand that they hold their nose and try to ignore the fantasy elements.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite><br/>It's an interesting topic for discussion: I don't know for sure whether the observed predominance of games with sensational/fantastic elements indicates that most players are disinterested in playing a game that is 100% mundane, but I think it certainly suggests that they are<i>less</i>interested.</blockquote>\nI think that in order to answer this you have to look at where the hobby originated. D&amp;D was a game designed to appeal to fans of war games and high fantasy novels. That was the original audience, and all (or at least the vast majority) of contemporary RPGs have grown out of that original audience. RPGs are hobby that largely grows by word of mouth, and people tend to socialize with people who share their interests. With that in mind, it's easy to see how a hobby that started life with fans of genre fiction would continue to remained mostly chained to that type of fiction, even as it grew.<br/><br/>Or, to put it differently: It's not that the audience have dictated fantastical games. It's that fantastical games have dictated the audience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
