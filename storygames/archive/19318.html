I can't remember exactly from where I hacked the idea, perhaps it was something from the PF decks. Well, I was expecting this game to have a low of solo scenes, where a single PC would do their stuff and leve the other players to bore or get distracted. So I made a deck that allows players to randomly add details, create or handle NPCs/monsters. We're having tons of fun and more interesting scenes, players keep focused on the game and I'm getting less work as a GM. <br/><br/>I'm also planning of coming back to a mechanic we called "villain of the day", that we used for a previous campaign. Basically, the characters from the first campaign had gone evil and were working now for the BBEG. On each session of the new campaign (where players were using new characters) everyone rolled a dice; higest rolling player get to play his villain self for the whole session and try to complete a mission from the BBEG to stop the party from doing something. They also got to choose between taking with them a lot of minions, a powerful monster or a rare item to help them in their mission. This mechanic led us to some of the best sessions we remember.<br/><br/>So, how about you? Have you ever let your players GM? How?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430203/#Comment_430203" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-28T18:28:34+00:00" title="March 28, 2014  6:28PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 29, 2014 11:04AM by Rickard.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I use two techniques in whatever I play, and that's 1) asking the players questions and 2) letting them make up stuff about the environment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430207/#Comment_430207" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-29T04:03:38+00:00" title="March 29, 2014  4:03AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 29, 2014 4:04AM by Upstart.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't really see much fun in GM-led systems that give any narrative power to the players.

Hey, I'm not even asking questions to the players! they just ask for the deck and for me it's a sign they are in the mood for adding things to the scene, and then they get limited agency only on whatever the card says.<br/><br/>Yet I'm always inclined to make that contribution more important if it suits the situation. For example, the active PC was conducting an scene with the princess and as usual, trying to obtain some leverage on the situation. Another inactive player asked for the deck and got a card that allowed him to add special effects to the scene, so he added "angered voices outside". I translated it into an argument among minor nobility about monsters rising in the north, and had the princess ask for a representative of those nobles. That bring the inactive player as an NPC into the scene and further discussion of the subject started between him, the active PC and a counselor of the pincess, handled by another player. The whole scene become the start of a new quest to the north, triggered by the players themselves, that would probably took me ages to railroad them into and wouldn't probably be half as fun as this scene was.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430222/#Comment_430222" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-29T11:03:58+00:00" title="March 29, 2014 11:03AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 29, 2014 12:48PM by Rickard.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Most players don't want to do this.

I would say only 5 % of all players doesn't get a hang of this, mostly because of insecurity. But it's not like you can throw these techniques into the players' faces. I introduce how I usually game master and what I would get out of roleplaying games, and I follow that up by playing out an exercise. Usually it's about creating stuff in the first scene, that I then start off from to actually run a prewritten adventure.<br/><br/>The most used question I ask is "Yes, is there one there?" if a player ask me about a certain object. It takes 4-5 times and then I see a sparkle in their eyes as they understand what I'm after, and creativity usually flows heavily after they get it. I especially remember, in my early days of experimenting with this, a situation where a guy asked me if there were a car on the street that passed by and after I responded with "Yes, is there one there" he described for a full minute that of course a car passed by, and how he fought the old lady driving the car so he could finally drive the car through a shopping window. But all this haven't been possible if I didn't explain my game mastering style at the beginning of the session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430227/#Comment_430227" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-29T11:39:06+00:00" title="March 29, 2014 11:39AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 29, 2014 12:49PM by Rickard.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The thing is, our party has reached an strange point of the social contract where the GM's fiat is still absolute, but then again, he choses to give players the chance to, well, we call it "troll the scene".

When I play with strong <i>player influence</i>, I'm making sure they understand that I can always counter what they made up by adding "Yes, but". Knowing about that restriction will reassure most players that they will overstep their boundaries. I wouldn't use this technique if the game were about exploring the setting, where the sensation is about what the players find but I'm not into that, and I think I can spend my energy on better things than describing the environment.<br/><br/>I once made a player making up what his character read on a piece of paper, with the restriction that it was an ad for something. Afterwards we talked about that and he didn't like it because he felt the risk of making up something that didn't fit the adventure. I can understand that point of view, and in games where you create a story together, you should have perfect information. If we were playing collaborative storytelling, then I would had said my own plans with it so he could invent something that correlated with that, but we were playing a <a href="http://www.gnomestew.com/gming-advice/the-fish-tank-as-a-mystery-2/" rel="nofollow">fish tank</a> where I had hidden agendas. What I had in mind with that piece of paper was to include what the player made up into my adventure. The players didn't follow up that lead, which was a shame.<br/><br/>Because that is a really strong non-mechanical reward, when the players improvise and the game master include that into the adventure. They feel that they are listened to and that their ideas are appreciated.  It takes a slightly different strategy when it comes to write an adventure that supports this but it's totally doable. And it takes a lot less time and energy from my side.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430232/#Comment_430232" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-29T12:28:04+00:00" title="March 29, 2014 12:28PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah; they're playing RPGs, of course they're creative!

I was looking in the safe because I wanted to know what evidence was inside, and the fun of discovering the answer was taken away from me. Also, throwing it back on me heavily implied that it was ultimately irrelevant what that evidence might have been, so instead of getting an interesting bit of information that I could enjoy trying to fit into the big picture and find a use for, I got a meaningless plot token that said "Okay, you ticked off the 'found some evidence' box, hooray for you."<br/><br/>Ever since then, I've been very careful as a GM and as a player to be absolutely clear about whether someone wants to discover a thing, or whether they want to create a thing.

(Read through the comments if you want more details.) There are many instances (even in Apocalypse World) where "line-crossing" is productive and good, and many games are based on powerful uses of "line-crossing".<br/><br/>But, in games where you want to have fictional input from your players *and* you want them to stay "in their characters' heads", so to speak, being aware of this line is a useful thing. For instance, let'say your character is finally face-to-face with the villainous murderer, and I, as the GM, am out of ideas. If I do this:<br/><br/>"Ok, Lucy, so tell me: what does the murderer do now?"<br/><br/>She's going to be taken aback. What? That's what she wants to know! And it's my job to tell her, so she can play her character and react. <br/><br/>But I can phrase the question in other ways, which keep her thinking "in-character" but still give me the same information. For example:<br/><br/>"Ok, Lucy, you're face-to-face with the murderer. Last time you saw him, how did he greet you?" <br/><br/>Or, let'say Lucy's character's name is Brigana.<br/><br/>"Ok, Brigana: This murderer has been a constant fear for you for the last two weeks, right? So... what are you most afraid the murderer will do when you meet him?"<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430247/#Comment_430247" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-29T19:25:33+00:00" title="March 29, 2014  7:25PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 29, 2014 7:28PM by Paul_T.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As another example, I love to make my players frame scenes for me without realizing it.

If the game is about discovering things, this technique wont work as well.<br/><br/>I can say that I'm sometimes startled when the game master is handing over things to me, but it's mostly about not talking about it in beforehand. It takes a different way  of playing, and it can take me 2-10 seconds to recalibrate to that play style. Also, when I asked a player to make up an ad, I didn't do that to some random person but to a player I knew could handle that. But yeah, he was startled too and it was kind of my fault because it wasn't actually included in the current play style (a fish tank is about discoveries).<br/><br/>Another thing I always play with is that the players can narrate whatever they want, as long as they don't affect anyone else or affect the adventure. Want to hit a can in 50 yards? Sure, unless you want to, for example, impress someone. Wanna jump cross a 50 yard ravine? Sure, if it's part of the genre, unless it's also part of the adventure (in which I would instead answer with "Yes, but" to make it an obstacle).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430256/#Comment_430256" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-29T23:18:16+00:00" title="March 29, 2014 11:18PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can resume all this into "There's only one case in which letting players GM definitely won't work: Whenever the GM doesn't give them clear guidelines"<br/><br/>Guidelines can be given in many ways, some more straight to the point, some that break inmersion, etc. And the less you ask from the players, the better. Clearly, players on a trad game won't be there for GMing with full agency, there that's the GMs work. Otherwise, that's what collaborative story-games are there for.<br/><br/>Guidelines need to have both clear indications of both limits and direction or the story, otherwise the technique will definitely confuse the players and give them a blank page syndrome, because they have to switch their mindframe from Reaction (or Action) to Creation, a mindframe so different that even if the game is supposed to be about both players and GM creating a story, it may take several minutes for any person to change from one mood into the other.<br/><br/>Yet everyone experiencing an story from either inside or outside is almost unconsciously thinking about how may the story go, what could happen next, and have in mind both an idea of what both the best and worst outcome can be, based on all the information they have now (of course both information known by their PCs and themselves as players)<br/><br/>So, for the technique to work and add it's due thrust into the game flow, you either draw new info from the player's foreboding or ask for really small bits of random elements and slowly mix and build upon them to add to the scene, or put clear guidelines for the players to add stuff, or state clearly at the start of the game that players need to be more into a creative role than into a reactive/active role.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430268/#Comment_430268" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-30T09:03:26+00:00" title="March 30, 2014  9:03AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 30, 2014 9:05AM by Paul_T.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WarriorMonk, I think the consensus here, if there is one, is more like that what you're describing is only true for a <i>certain type</i> of dedicated trad gamer. Lots of (regular) players love having as much input as possible, and newbies/first-time players never balk at creative input*, since they don't have any expectations that would be broken by doing so. (In fact, in my experience, most first-time RPG players DO instinctively add stuff to the fiction and want to participate in collaborative story creation; it requires training and habits to get them to <i>stop</i> doing that and stick to the viewpoint of their characters only.)<br/><br/>If I'm wrong in this, someone should correct me, of course. But this has been my experience, and I've often heard the same from other people in these discussions.<br/><br/>There's also the big question of "what is the game about?" If the object of the game is to confront a challenge created by the GM, a player will be surprised if they are asked to resolve the challenge by fiat ("Well, does the dragon die when you hit it with the lance?"); if the object of the game is to discover some great mystery, and the players have been playing with the hopes if finding something cool, they won't be happy if they're asked to imagine "what's in the safe" at the end of it: they'll feel misled. In a game like Doctor Magnethands, on the other hand, I doubt any player will hold back with their creative input, because collaborative creation is so very clearly the point of the game.<br/><br/><br/>*: I've seen some first-time players balk at creative input. But these players are hesitant at every level: whether it's coming up with a creative contribution, or making a character, or making in-character decisions. They're just hesitant to contribute to the game, or shy. It's not about "crossing the line" for them at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430272/#Comment_430272" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-30T09:16:37+00:00" title="March 30, 2014  9:16AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 30, 2014 10:16AM by AsIf.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>in my experience, most first-time RPG players DO instinctively add stuff to the fiction and want to participate in collaborative story creation; it requires training and habits to get them to <i>stop</i> doing that</blockquote>Yup.  Ditto.  (for trad games)<br/><br/>I once had a game turn into psychodrama in the worst sense of the word; I GMed for a senior couple who had never played an RPG before, and I ran "Call of Cthulhu".  Failing to understand where their creative input ended and mine began, they started ad-libbing things faster than I could counter them, talking more to each other than to me, and bringing all this psychological baggage from 40 years of marriage straight into the game.  I'm dropping clues and narrating chilling scenes of foreshadowing and trying to get their attention; they're simply using me as a backdrop for airing their personal issues, doing things that had nothing to do with their characters, creating whole rooms, bringing in people they know from real life, etc.  When the Creeping Death oozed up the stairs for them and there was nowhere else to go, the husband's character lept out the 2nd-story window and ran away, screaming "Take her!

I understand I'm being too assertive and I know I'm not the sole owner of the truth but perhaps my point of view is more open than I've shown previously. Allow me to expand it:<br/><br/>When I wrote about "Guidelines" I meant it more like "have all players reach an agreement about the game, getting to the same page both in terms of genre of the contributed material and amount of agency over the creative agenda", a situation where players with more experience will share their usual procedures or where players with more knowledge of the system or knowledge of previous functional social contracts will share what they know. We can also say it's all about Communication, but since I was thinking of trad games where GM fiat is so usual and teaching the game is usually the responsability of the GM, I went for "Guidelines" <br/><br/>But we're still talking about communication, which as complex as it is, it can be expressed not only through the things we say, but by whatever our actions imply, what other people can get from our emotional reactions or even our lack of them.<br/><br/>So, whenever in a trad game, the GM prompts for player input in a way that gives them agency over the setting further from their character's sphere of influence and it works, my analysis has lead me to think that in a high percentage of the cases, it's because the guidelines have been clearly stablished. Perhaps in more than one occassion, perhaps in some of those occassions by acts that implied rulings behind them or even by omissions that implied a logic behind them, therefore defining this part of the social contract.<br/><br/>What I meant is that it's not about how people <i>are</i>, as long as they are somewhat functional enough to play the game, but about how people <i>communicate</i> between themselves to create and organization that allows them to play the game with certain specific mechanics. In resume, I think there must be a way to stablish proper guidelines to allow <i>most</i> players add specific creative input into a game in a way that doesn't breake the inmersion, violate the social contract and even adds to the game flow.<br/><br/>More than that, I'm quite sure words won't be enough to make it functional. The GM with the support of more experienced players will need to show newbies how it's done. Perhaps reading more about how other groups accomplish this will also helps others to understand how it can be done.<br/><br/>Now, I'd say my experience wasn't about <i>shared narrative</i>, it was more like, the players had a chance to add an element and then as a GM, I direct and build on it. <br/><br/>The order of the procedure was that first, the players disengaged from the inmmerssion a bit (they went out of character and watched another player go at the scene). Then, they watched me frame the scene and got inspired to participate, which they signalled me by asking to draw a card from the deck. The card stablished a limit to the element they could add and control: an specific kind of npc with an specific role, add a sound, and obstacle, give an NPC an automatic success at something, etc. They consulted me or just gave the card back if they couldn't come with something, or if they weren't sure if it was applicable. In 80% of the cases I went with their first idea and added a couple details to justify the presence of the new element in the scene. On the rest, I made small adjustments and on a couple of occassions I asked the players to come up with something else. Then, the scene was solved as usual either with or without further intervention of the players whose characters weren't present.<br/><br/>I kept giving players clear guidelines and asking small bits of specific input at each point. I think I didn't used even a single open ended question, so you see why I can't even call this <i>shared narrative</i>.<br/><br/>Of course, open ended questions are quite good, even if they aren't for everybody (I've seen a player declare himself totally uncomfortable with open ended questions and I had a bit stressful experience with them myself the first time I was asked one) and there are a lot other methods out there, so I'm wondering what other stuff works and what doesn't. Thanks so far for your help everyone, this is been quite interesting so far!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430284/#Comment_430284" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-30T13:04:59+00:00" title="March 30, 2014  1:04PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry for the doublepost, but let me also give it a go at the cracked safebox case: My take would be to first check my setting to see if there's anything I can put in the safe to make the story go in a certain way. I mean, ok, I'm the GM and right now I've got no idea of what to put in there... then my first thought always go at "Where should I take the players next?". So, the reward for the players is that the story develops further <i>because</i> they breake the safe. I'm still on control and the illusion is safe. But ok, that's being a filthy Illusionist. <br/><br/>I could also be openly honest and say the players "ok, you got me, I've got no idea what to put there. What did you expected to find?". It breakes the inmersion but at least it gives the players the idea that they won at the game by ruining the GM's plans, which is actually another valid reward for the competitive element of the game (which I believe is often present at trad games, even if it is in a small percentage and/or directed at different players through the game.<br/><br/>There's also the simple logic answer. What's normally in a safebox? Money. That's it, you find 1d6 thousand dollars in whatever presentation you consider colorful enough, perhaps a diamond, papers of a car or a house, etc. In any case, it can't be nothing, specially with all the effort the player went through to crack it. That doesn't mean the consequences of this can't be interesting. How are they now going to dispose of whatever they found in the safe? What are going to do the rightful owners of the safebox when they find out? You don't need to make this a distraction from the main story, you can always choose an existing NPC and relate the contents of the safe to them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430286/#Comment_430286" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-30T13:20:18+00:00" title="March 30, 2014  1:20PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, interestingly, even though my trad players expect a lot of prep out of me, they also seem to love it when they hit me with a suggestion I must scramble to invent a rule for.
