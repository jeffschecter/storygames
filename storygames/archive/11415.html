This stuff sounds a whole lot like what I've been pawing my way towards, but I've never heard of anyone over here doing anything at all similar.</blockquote>\nAs per the request, I'm starting a new thread.<br/><br/>As I think about this thread, I think it is better that I pay a homage to a game the likes of which I had never seen before, and I'm never likely to see again.<br/><br/>Australia has a tradition of blurring the boundaries in roleplaying, this has happened for decades. I know that there are other traditions around the world which blend live action and tabletop play, and there are plenty of examples of games where miniatures are blended with tabletop play, but I know of very few examples where miniatures and live action play have been belnded into a subtle and political game.<br/><br/>The game has since faded away; the once majestic city is now a ruined piece of wood, crushed foam, crumpled cardboard and twisted metal (I had the fortune of seeing some of the remains a few years ago)...but in it's glory, it was a staple of the Sydney roleplaying convention scene, it made appearances up and down the east coast of Australia, it had a rich history spanning centuries in game and a decade or longer in the "real world", hundreds of people shared in it's history.<br/><br/>I talk of the fabled "Raven's Nest".<br/><br/>Few probably remember it now, it is a lost shadow of a memory. One of the few internet references I can find to this epic game is about a third of the way down a page, leading to <a href="http://users.zipworld.com.au/~rossiter/miniatures.htm" rel="nofollow">a broken link for a dead game store</a> (The link is the third one down in the miniature's purchasing section). The game store was named after the epic city.<br/><br/>It's a shame.<br/><br/>I only ever played the game once, and that game was one of it's last appearances. It seems to have made an encore appearance in 2005 (<a href="http://ausrpgarchive.net/maccon2005/games.php?game=96" rel="nofollow">as indicated here</a>), but I didn't attend that convention and I believe the city would have had to be half rebuilt, because I last saw it before this convention and it wasn't in a healthy state.<br/><br/>But enough with my requiem....what was it all about?<br/><br/>The core of Raven's Nest was a miniature city, divided up into 25mm (or about 1 inch) squares. I remember it being huge with modular pieces about half a metre square (20 squares by 20 squares) it was made up of winding streets, detailed courtyards and covered in buildings. The whole thing would have been at least two metres by four metres based on my memory, but it would have been 15 years ago when I played it, so you'll have to bear with me regarding any inconsistencies or the clouding of nostalgia.<br/><br/>I was lucky to get into the game, it was the kind of thing you heard about and you usually had to register early if you wanted a chance of participating. I had a good friend at the time who recommended it to me and I was helping him to organise the convention, so I managed to secure my place. It was like a Wonka Golden ticket to a marvellous land I could only have dreamed of at the time.<br/><br/>There were 25 players, five each for five factions.<br/><br/>Each player had a miniature representing themselves, and they might have had some henchmen or guards. Everyone could wander the town in search of like minded souls to pick up as additional posse members.<br/><br/>The character stats were simple, I don't remember the combat system except that it was very rudimentary. A roll to hit, against the defence of the victim's posse. A roll for damage against the victim's armour. <br/><br/>Every faction had a goal, every character had a goal, every character had links to at least one other person in one of the other factions.<br/><br/>The rules were explained and everyone was set loose.<br/><br/>Players would move their pieces around the city, a few squares every minute or so. If two players had their pieces in the same alleyway, or the same building, they could discuss something in private, or engage on another in conflict. If war took to the streets, then riots could start and the town guard could come in to maintain the peace (with most of the offending players thrown into the nearest prison, unless they had a favour to call in, or the relevant political connections).<br/><br/>Over the course of a few hours, agendas would be revealed, certain locations in the city would become important to the developing storyline (and if you were too far away, you might manage to get somewhere just in time to see the aftermath of a magical duel, or other spectacular sequence).<br/><br/>Gradually, a greater plot would resolve through the development of these agendas and the city would be changed as a result of the evolving events.<br/><br/>I'm sorry I can't provide a lot more information about the game specifics at this point, but I'll try to get in contact with some of my old friends who might still be in contact with the original designer.<br/><br/>I'd love to make a new version of the game myself, and I have a few dozen "Labyrinth" style goblin village modules that I could throw together for this sort of thing. It's one of those things I've been meaning to do for years, to carry on the legacy of this strange hybrid game.  <br/><br/>If you've got any specific questions about this style of play, I'll see what I can do to answer them.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254201/#Comment_254201" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T02:58:23+00:00" title="February  1, 2010  2:58AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I did some googling for you.<br/>Is <a href="http://www.gamertheory.net/ravensnest/tabid/127/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">this</a> the same game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG" title="Albi_SG"><img alt="Albi_SG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG">Albi_SG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254214/#Comment_254214" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T06:26:09+00:00" title="February  1, 2010  6:26AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I Don't know what to say. but this sounds just Wonderful. and i don't mean jjust awesome, but really, literally, wonder-full.

If northerain is correct about that link, you could almost play it with the sketch from the download.<br/><br/>Having said that, the big set up is usually a big part of the draw. <br/><br/>Check this pic out:<br/><a href="http://www.pulpfigures.com/picshow.php?file=2&amp;custID=209121151991264446935" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.pulpfigures.com/picshow.php?file=2&amp;custID=209121151991264446935</a><br/><br/>Apparently some fellas up Canada way do something similar using that set up regularly, although their rules system seems much closer to traditional minis-skirmishing, albeit with a number of players (although smaller than the 25 that vulpinoid is talking about. My impression from other posts at that site is that 6-10 players is more normal).<br/><br/>See, I like minis, and I like the spectacle aspect. <br/><br/>But, I kinda hate the mental limitations of the wargame format*. That's why this Raven's Nest thing is just so amazing to me.<br/><br/>(*Or simply, I already have a ton of pre-existing examples of minis+wargame. I just like seeing stuff that escapes that box a bit, and still has the minis spectacle).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254369/#Comment_254369" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T17:50:21+00:00" title="February  1, 2010  5:50PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Northerain, <br/><br/>Yes, <a href="http://www.gamertheory.net/ravensnest/tabid/127/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">this</a>is the same game.<br/><br/>Your google-fu is greater than mine.<br/><br/>That document gives a decent "in-game" history of the city as it developed through numerous conventions. But the appendix adapting play to GURPS does the city an injustice.<br/><br/>Thinking about it some more, Raven's Nest was a natural evolution of the <a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/104/braunstein-the-roots-of-roleplaying-games/" rel="nofollow">Braunstein</a>. It headed in a slightly different direction to the hobby we know consider to be traditional roleplaying, but it is a clear evolutionary descendant of the same concepts.<br/><br/>It's creator <a href="http://www.sjgames.com/ill/a/2004-04-10" rel="nofollow">Greg Rickards</a>, was one of the legends of Sydney gaming for many years. Further research now indicates that the city is making a return to the Sydney convention scene, I'm going to have to track it down at an upcoming event. Especially since I know some of the people who seem to be involved (including the author of the linked "Player's Guide", Stephen Gryphon).<br/><br/>As for some of the specific questions...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>1) Was this GMed similar to freeforms, with multiple GMs, say around 1 GM to 5 players or so?</blockquote>\nYes. Sort of.<br/><br/>Since I played in an evolved version of the game, we actually played on two city maps. The primary city map was chambered in one room, this was the upper city. Literally next door was another map layout depicting the undercity and sewer system. There was a dedicated GM for each.<br/><br/>I think there may have been a number of specialist GMs as well, one for magic, one for combat. All of the GMs reported to a central GM, the designer of the game. <br/><br/>Faction leaders were quasi-GM roles. You typically couldn't play one unless you'd played a couple of times before and knew the basic rules and politics of the city. Faction leaders were always a new player first point of call when determining if they could do something.<br/><br/>So GMing basically followed a hierarchy of power...New players (regular characters) &lt; Veterans (faction leaders) &lt; Specific Area/Concept GMs (Who often controlled a significant NPC as well) &lt; Greg Rickards.\n<blockquote>2) You mentioned that players could interact based on their proximity ( based on character mini location). How much real time did players have in this regard?</blockquote>\nI'm not sure of the specific question being asked here, but I'll answer it from a few perspectives...<br/><br/>1. People could spend as much time as they wanted in a common location discussing politics. I do remember groups of people spending half and hour or more in a secluded corner of the room working out deals while they sent out other players to perform tasks for them. If you wanted to break up their meeting, you might have to get through their guards at the door.<br/><br/>2. I don't remember specifics, but I think movement across the table was a number of squares per 3 minutes (using an egg timer to mark 3 minute increments). That's probably how I'd do it now.<br/><br/>3. Combats would run in a vaguely real time situation. The three minute movement cycle would also control a cycle of combat skirmish, hence you want a good quick combat system.\n<blockquote>3) How much freedom/responsibility did players have to take care of game stuff by themselves ( pretty common in LARPs and apparently freeforms+multiforms, not so much in traditional tabletop)?</blockquote>\nA lot of freedom, but this is regulated in play.<br/><br/>A new player is free to pursue any course of play that they want. But it is recommended by their faction leader that they undertake certain tasks, if they don't do so, they are held accountable in game by their faction leader (who has certain objectives of their own and requires their underlings to fulfill many of them).<br/><br/>It wasn't unheard of for a group of players to forge a new alliance to push a session in a very different direction. The designer never stopped this from happening and always worked a way to incorporate this into the city's history.<br/><br/>Like miniatures games, most actions were resolved by two players. It was usually only when things took a dramatic turn that GMs were called in, or if something couldn't be resolved then it was pushed up the GM chain of command.\n<blockquote>4) Why are my countrymen incapable of conceptualizing this sort of play?(Okay, not entirely true; I'm just grumbly because I can't seem to find the ones who can, IRL and very few online)</blockquote>\nNo comment.<br/><br/>But since I've already indicated the similarity to the Braunstein, I'd say that the concept does arise from time to time. You just need the right person to drive it.\n<blockquote>5) If you were to build your Labyrinth game, what general ideas from (the broad category of) story games would you like to blend into the system/culture mix?</blockquote>\nA lot of the core concepts seem to hold up well under a story game paradigm.<br/><br/>This is a question I'll have to think about though\n<blockquote>6) Do you recall a time when someone, probably a GM or an experienced gamer, had to come up with a way to put across the diea that, despite the presence of minis and combat rules, that the style of this thing wasn't simply that of a skirmish wargame scenario?</blockquote>\nBy the time I encountered it, Raven's Nest was a local phenomenon. Word of mouth had been going for years and if you knew about the game, you already knew that it was far more than just miniatures.<br/><br/>Typically, those who did come in with preconceived notions of an overblown wargame were quickly shocked by the freeform scope and lack of GM direction. It was truly the state of GM as facilitator rather than GM as storyteller. \n<blockquote>7) Can you tell me anything about the way having so many participants ( you mentioned 25 players, plus more than that in characters if some had henchman or rounded up NPCs) impacted play?</blockquote>\nFor want of a better term, this made the game more organic than your standard table top. You knew that everyone had their own agendas rather than just being foils to a single GM plot, you never knew if someone actions were due to their own choices (as a player) or due to the agendas of their character and faction.<br/><br/>In some ways it was mayhem, but it seemed to flow well. <br/><br/>And it was certainly memorable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254401/#Comment_254401" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T22:46:49+00:00" title="February  1, 2010 10:46PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 1, 2010 10:49PM by komradebob.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That does cover what I was asking vulpinoid, which was basically about how long a turn was before players could move their minis again.<br/><br/>A couple of thoughts-<br/><br/>Raven's Nest itself is such a classic fantasy city.

For example, I'm starting to really understand why it is important to functioning that there be a largish number of people involved in playing, and also why the rules as such need to be relatively forgiving of damage on characters in the early part of the game, and even why similar games have relatively short movement rates on the whole, but let miniatures move fairly regularly.<br/><br/>Do you know of anyone else who has run this sort of thing, especially if they talk about the scenario design side of things somewhere.<br/><br/>I'd also be very interested in hearing about how the overall group of people who put together and GM one of these organize themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254934/#Comment_254934" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T22:21:49+00:00" title="February  3, 2010 10:21PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            vulpinoid:<br/><br/>If you're still following this thread, what would you have done with your Labyrinth idea?

It was designed to be played on two levels, one as a "Diplomacy"-style strategic board game, the other as an action-packed supernatural game about reality TV show bounty-hunters. In the roleplaying game, players move their characters across a real world map of a city (naturally I use Sydney as my region of operations). Characters can only interact with targets in the same region as themselves, or they might be able to assist allies in adjacent locations.<br/><br/>Specifically, the city map I use is roughly 4 feet square, divided into over 100 regions (each divided in regions of equal population according to government census data). Many of the regions have specific locations depicted such as significant shopping complexes, factories, power stations, etc. Players are encouraged to use these noted locations as areas for dramatic showdowns with their enemies.<br/><br/>The diplomacy version of the game is designed to run in a similar format to an Australian freeform, with players assigned personal tasks, factional tasks, while time and location specific events crop up during the course of the scenario. I had even considered following the notion of using experienced players as sub-GMs in addition to their role of faction heads (much like the Raven's Nest GM layout above). <br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/>For the Goblin labyrinth concept, I'd probably make the game more like a miniatures game. I have modular city pieces 30cm (1 foot) square, and modular maze pieces the same size. I'd run a game where a single strategic point is placed at the centre of a large table, this might be a sorcerous tower, a temple, or maybe even a garden. Everyone would then get the chance to place one or two city pieces around this (two each if there are only a few players, one each if there were more than a dozen). Finally a ring of maze pieces would be placed around the outside. This would set the context of the area being fought over...much like the movie labyrinth, the maze changes and areas outside the defined locations would be subject to a magical flux. <br/><br/>To make the concept work properly, you need the agendas to integrate.<br/><br/>A few basic ideas...<br/><br/>Make the agendas varied: some should relate to specific locations and should oppose one another ("Claim the Citadel", "Destroy the Citadel", "Defend the Citadel"), others should relate the specific factions ("Reveal and Kill the Insurgents", "Reveal and Aid the Insurgents", "Prevent the Insurgents from being revealed").<br/><br/>Certain agendas would provide benefits while they remain valid, others would provide benefits once they have been resolved. To use the previous examples, a character whose aim is to "Defend the Citadel" gets a bonus while the citadel is still standing and probably gains a further bonus if the are within the citadel, specifically defending it from intruders...they'd lose all bonuses and a decent chunk of morale if the citadel fell.<br/><br/>The idea is to ensure every character has enough agendas to keep them occupied for the duration of the game, some of which may be related, others not. In fact, it's usually best to ensure a player needs to seek out other characters to complete their agendas, the group social aspect is something that really makes these games special. Some scenario designers make sure players have too many agendas to complete in the alloted time, to make the players consciously decide which storylines they want to follow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255017/#Comment_255017" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-04T10:05:48+00:00" title="February  4, 2010 10:05AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 4, 2010 11:00AM by komradebob.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow! Lots of great stuff in there!<br/><br/>1) I like the idea of having multiple agendas, and forcing players to prioritize, mostly because I see it as giving players the ability to choose a bit more about how they play their character. Would it also be common for designers to have built-in (apparently) contradictory agendas for a character?<br/><br/>2) I don't know exactly how it would work in this context, but Matthjis' game Archipelago assigns players authority over certain parts of the canon. So, for example, one player might be assigned final(ish) authority over how magic works in the setting being played. Maybe you can combine that with your multiple GM concept?<br/><br/>3) One of the things that strikes me about your mention of the faction heads players is that it suggests to me that there could easily be 2-3 "levels" of characters, with different sorts of abilities in the game. Your faction heads are the more broadview community leader types ( whatever that means in context: King of the Beggars, Head of the Blablahblah Guild, High Priest of whatever), then a layer down of potential rivals and schemers, and another level down of more wildcard individuals.<br/><br/>The easy division ( with 5 characters within a single faction) would be 1:2:2, but you could really vary that to give different factions more color.<br/><br/>It also strikes me as an interesting way to approach an individual character's capabilities, even if you just go with descriptives, rather than hard stats.<br/><br/>4) It wasn't in your last post, but I'm very interested in the way that characters are built into the relationship web before the game is presented. For example, you'd mentioned that each character has at least one tie to another faction/character in another faction. I get why that's important, I'm just trying to figure out a tool or method that would make creating that web easier for designers of these kinds of games.<br/><br/>5) Turning Aussie play culture into mechanics<br/>You've mentioned that the culture of freeforms has a certain built-in understanding about not going for the throat straight out of the gate. Basically, eeryone is there to play and has paid their money to get in to the game, so it would be considered pretty dickish to just, say, go over and kill a rival character straight away. OTOH, it seems like the games do reach some kind of final round where it's okay to take the gloves off.<br/><br/>I'm wondering if there might be a way to combine those concepts with time usage.Maybe a two or three part time concept in the game? Like, I dunno, during the first hour, hour and a half of play, player characters simply can't be killed. At the end of the first period, there's some sort of timeout/break and accounting of events, then play resumes with more "hardcore" rules in effect.<br/><br/>6) About your Labyrinth idea<br/>Would you have players always setting out the bulk of the table modules as part of the creation of the game set up? I could see that being cool, but also a bit of a hassle. It does get at some SGish concepts though, about worldbuilding as translated to minis use.<br/><br/>I also get the impression that the Raven's Claw model actually evolved and was expanded on over time, becoming more refined and complex as it made the convention circuit. Were you thinking of doing something similar with Labyrinth?<br/><br/>Also, while I understand from the source material why you'd have the surrounding Labyrinth modules, I'm not clear about how you see them fitting in to the game events. Could you tell me more about that? It does seem like Raven's Nest had some out-of-town areas, but I'm not entirely clear how those fit in either.<br/><br/>7) If you get the Labyrinth project up and running, what sort of minis are you looking at getting for it? I've seen some really great stuff by small manufacturers, but that stuff can be a pain to come by. Were you thinking of modifying minis to get a more Brian Froud kind of feel?<br/><br/>(Also, check out the waggamaephs from Crunch-Waffle:  <a href="http://www.crunch-waffle.com/miniatures_culture.php?cultureID=9" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.crunch-waffle.com/miniatures_culture.php?cultureID=9</a> )                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
