So here it is:<br/><br/><b>Subject matter:</b> I think the act of exploring a landscape (geographical or cultural) and interacting with the environmental narrative is profound, beautiful, and provides us with opportunities to drop our past attachments. I think there is fertile ground to explore the tension between past attachments and change of self through exploration. <br/><br/><b>Roleplaying as a practice: </b>This is in the GM-player section. Play to see what happens, explore how your character changes and how they change the landscape, play should be driven towards conflict of past attachments and current situation. <br/><br/><b>Real live human nature:</b> I think people fear explorers and wanderers, at some level, because of their own fear of losing their attachments to how they define themselves. When you open yourself to new landscapes you break this cycle but also risk losing all your attachments. <br/><br/>ara                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339069/#Comment_339069" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-16T13:54:49+00:00" title="August 16, 2011  1:54PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2011 1:54AM by Wilhelm.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Matthijs,<br/><br/>Even if you're only buying a single game this year I say you should get <a href="http://wilper.wordpress.com/while-the-world-ends/" rel="nofollow">While the World Ends</a> - A story game about a future on the brink of change.<br/><br/><a href="http://wilper.wordpress.com/while-the-world-ends/" rel="nofollow">While the World Ends</a> is a game in which you play science fiction stories, in settings you create yourself, and explore the issues that interest you. Using the game's streamlined setting generation system you will have a new interesting setting every time you play the game. <br/><br/><a href="http://wilper.wordpress.com/while-the-world-ends/" rel="nofollow">While the World Ends</a> is a GM-less story game, and you and the other players each control one main protagonist of your own. You get to follow your character as he/she(/it?) struggles to reach an important goal, while the world is on the brink of a change that may render it unrecognizable. Will you be able to reach the goal before the changing world makes it impossible?<br/><br/>In <a href="http://wilper.wordpress.com/while-the-world-ends/" rel="nofollow">While the World Ends</a> your protagonist's story is separate from the stories of the other players, yet all the stories intertwine, become connected and affect each other as they progress. Even if they may seem completely independent as the game starts, you will be delighted to see how every piece fits together.<br/><br/><a href="http://wilper.wordpress.com/while-the-world-ends/" rel="nofollow">While the World Ends</a> is also a competitive game. You will team up with another player and together you will compete with the other team to see who will win the game and get the privilege to narrate how the impending changes the setting. You will find that the game is nicely balanced, random enough that it remains interesting if a team of veterans face a team of beginners, yet strategic enough that you will find that every choice you make matters and affects your chances of success.<br/><br/><a href="http://wilper.wordpress.com/while-the-world-ends/" rel="nofollow">While the World Ends</a> is well suited for drop-in or convention play. You don't have to prepare anything before you all sit down to play. And the game plays start to finish in three or four hours, without rushing things or taking shortcuts. The game itself is only 40 pages long, and very easy to both learn and teach. All the important rules and procedures are summarized in three pages for easy reference.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>With all the above said.  I wrote WTWE in 2009 and released it both in English and Swedish. It made a splash like a pebble in the ocean, not at all.  Which I think is a great shame, because it is a very neat game. I have played it a lot, and every single game has been a good one. I couldn't name any other RPG that is a more reliable source of <i>awesome</i> gaming experiences. Every single game has produced interesting and memorable stories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339082/#Comment_339082" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-16T15:05:04+00:00" title="August 16, 2011  3:05PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 16, 2011 3:07PM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>Tell me about your game!

It has a few twists, all ones that have done decently in other games.<br/><br/>The players build the setting, but they do so from components - if they use my pre-built components, they'll <i>likely</i> get something that sniffs like an Iron Age world gone sideways into totemic magic and alchemy.  If they make their own, or have another aim in mind and describe things in cool ways, they might get something rather different.<br/><br/>The core system is the Exchange - imagine a Sorcerer/Fate hybrid, with d6s, and you're somewhere in the ballpark.<br/><br/>The result is a traditional (semi-sandbox) game, run on indie material.

Have you ever wondered what that passerby\u2019s life is like? Are they a mentally unstable yoga instructor, a down-on-his-luck balloon animal artist, the next Timothy McVeigh? This game allows your imaginations to run wild in a collaborative story-telling environment. <br/><br/>The game is best when played by 3+ people, though 5 is probably a better number to start with.<br/><br/>No dice. No GM. No setup. All you need are people, a place that allows for good people watching, and a way to keep track of points. (Though, there have been a couple of good suggestions to make the game accessible without having to break that social barrier of having to, you know, go outside)<br/><br/>Aside from being fun in its own right, this can be a good group-building game and an interesting look into how your group operates. For those looking to play Burning Wheel or any other game with an artha/fate mechanic, I would recommend playing this as a lesson in point (artha/fate) distribution to keep the flow moving during your regular gaming sessions.<br/><br/>My blog is over <a href="http://gamingally.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The game is 100% free, so if you'd like a copy, send me a message on G+ or leave a comment on my blog and I can send you the PDF. I also have some printed cheat-cards I can mail out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339202/#Comment_339202" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-17T07:01:53+00:00" title="August 17, 2011  7:01AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2011 7:04AM by Andy.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jim pinto</cite>You click and the timer at the bottom of FIREFOX says done.</blockquote>\n...then that's a problem with Firefox or one of your extensions, not "Lulu".

You don't have to sacrifice versatility for power when making a hero, there's a simple gear system in place (including vehicle generation and combat), and combat is fairly gritty. A big focus is on your hero's Motivations and managing your Determination resource; too little, and your hero suffers from the stresses of trying to save the world. The book includes a detailed setting, Earth-Omega, and over a dozen NPCs, both heroes, villains, and bystanders.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Edit to fix the link for IPR.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340426/#Comment_340426" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-25T06:09:23+00:00" title="August 25, 2011  6:09AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wilhelm</cite>Hi Matthijs,<br/><br/>Even if you're only buying a single game this year I say you should get<a href="http://wilper.wordpress.com/while-the-world-ends/" rel="nofollow">While the World Ends</a>- A story game about a future on the brink of change.</blockquote>\nWell, that worked rather well, I'd say.<br/><br/>My copy arrived in the mail today.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ParadoxBoy" title="ParadoxBoy"><img alt="ParadoxBoy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ParadoxBoy">ParadoxBoy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340431/#Comment_340431" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-25T07:27:54+00:00" title="August 25, 2011  7:27AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://houseofcardsrpg.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">House of Cards</a> isn't out yet, but coming soon (playtesting is wrapping up now).<br/>\n<br/>\nA Major Arcana of the Tarot has chosen you as its agent.

Ive done the first 'lady blackbird' style canned sceanrio to be released with the rules, called BLACK SUN.  Here is the players intro blurb :<br/><br/><br/>Major Septimus Braithwaite leant wearily against the dusty stone wall of the tunnel.  Swapping his desk for some fieldwork in Paris seemed like a good idea at the time.  Had he known it would involve tramping for kilometres through twisting catacombs, he would have changed his mind \u2013 almost.   He surveyed his three companions exposed by the dimly flickering lantern.  Rainer Hertz, burly arms hugging his knees and rocking slightly, attention inward-focused as usual.  Tshilaba Kovacs, also as usual, as far away from Rainer as the cramped conditions would allow.  She felt his gaze and stopped rotating the dagger between her fingertips to return a quick smile.  And John Shaw \u2013 head cocked, crouched and ready with Maxim in hand, staring intently down the tunnel.  He stiffened slightly and aimed as a shape emerged from the pitch black.  \u201cBoo!\u201d said the shape, now grinning.  It was Mouataz, of course.  Shaw lowered his pistol and shook his head, causing the grin on the young Moroccan\u2019s face to grow.<br/>\u201cThey\u2019re up ahead around a few more turns\u201d, he said. \u201cMaybe three hundred meters.  I think we better hurry if we don\u2019t want to miss the show.\u201d  <br/>Braithwaite straightened and gripped his cane firmly.  \u201dQuickly then, Felix and John, take the lead.  Rainer, the rear.  What can we expect, Felix?\u201d<br/>Mouataz\u2019s smile faded now.  \u201cThey\u2019ve knocked a hole in the tunnel wall that leads to a large chamber.  I didn\u2019t get too good a look, but I think it\u2019s some kind of ceremony.  Some chanting and like that.  Fourteen\u2026 men.  I think.  Most of them soldier types, but one of them?  Something not right about him.  And \u2013 they have a pretty girl down there in the middle.  Bartards!\u201d  His curse was echoed by something in Tshilaba\u2019s Gypsy tongue.<br/>As they neared the chamber, the chanting grew in volume, and the light from many lit torches spilled into their side tunnel.  The chamber itself was circular with a vaulted ceiling.  A symbol was marked in black on the floor \u2013 the symbol of the black sun as the German occultists called it.  Around this symbol stood twelve Nazi soldiers, each holding a lit candle, and in the centre was the young girl, writhing on the floor as if in the very throes of death.  Braithwaite heard Shaw draw a hissing breath and whisper, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br/>Braithwaite turned his attention quickly to the last two occupants of the chamber.  The first was probably an SS officer, bare to the waist and holding a bloody dagger in one hand, evidently having carved the same symbol into his own flesh.  This one, then, was leading the ceremony.  And the second?  Apparently an SS general.  Braithwaite felt as if the tunnel was collapsing in on him!  Could it be?  Dry, withered.  Lipless\u2026  It brought back vivid memories of that terrible battle in the trenches twenty years ago.<br/>He was shaken from this reverie by Shaw\u2019s hand clamping on his arm, and his pleading, demanding, \u201cSir?!\u201d.  It was unusual to see Shaw so rattled.  Strangely it helped Braithwaite refocus.  The girl started to emit a rasping, ululating keening that made his eardrums crackle, and the Nazi officer redoubled his efforts, head thrown back, screaming guttural words at the ceiling.  Shaw hoisted his weapon and implored again \u201cSir!  What should we do!?\u201d<br/>Just then the Nazi General turned his head and looked directly at them.  Even without lips, Braithwaite could have sworn he was smiling\u2026                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
