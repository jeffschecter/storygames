If the first session fills up, I'll probably sign up for a second slot in the game dungeon. All props to Rafial who ran the hell out of this at GPNW.<br/><br/>So Wilhelm and others, help a GM out and tell me what you've learned from running this game. Any house rules that have been useful for you?

First thing that comes to mind is "don't overprepare". Part of the fun is letting the environment build out in play.  As examples, I've found Tomb of the Iron God, or most of the levels of The Darkness Beneath published in Fight On to have just the right amount of detail.  A map, some random encounter tables, a few pre-placed major adversaries, and a generalized notion of "what goes on down here."  I'll specifically site the most recent level of TDB (The Lower Caves) published in the most recent issue of FO as being too overprepared for my tastes.<br/><br/>Additional things that are useful are the usual list of NPCs names that you'd want when playing any game, as well as a few random tables of "dungeon dressing". I've gotten tons of mileage out of "Dungeon Detritus" in Fight On <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>.<br/><br/>One important thing to keep in mine when rolling on random tables: it's totally in the DM's purview to tweak, modify, or reroll results.  The use of random monster, item, event &amp; treasure tables is to spur your imagination during play, not to hem you in.<br/><br/>As to house rules, here's my <a href="http://docs.google.com/View?id=dcm9st7c_2ddrtjffm" rel="nofollow">current doc</a> for the most part.  Being a soft hearted GM, I'm also using the Death's Door table (also from FO 3) with the following variant: roll 1d6 + current HP value (which will be negative, so you effectively subtracting here) + level.  So basically provides a death save if you've gone a couple points negative, but no joy if your paste.  On the other hand, if your tastes run more hardcore, then no need to provide such weasel room.<br/><br/>...the most important thing about house rules I think is making sure that they are seasoned to YOUR taste.  About the only essential one is to decide on some ability check mechanic.  The two most popular are some form of d20 vs stat (which I went with) or 1d6 + stat mod.  The first makes stats matter a little more, the second is more derivable from the OD&amp;D RAW.<br/><br/>Another thing that occurred to me as I run this style of game is the important of leaving the player's to work out their own procedures &amp; pecking order.  In running at GPNW I saw everything from every man for themselves to a formal caller structure appear spontaneously at the table.  Be sure to inform the players they are responsible for their own mapping, and let them work it out from there.  Above all, resist the urge to correct their map unless the mistake is such that would be blatantly obvious to somebody who is actually standing in the imaginary location.  But dimensions that are off a little, shapes not quite right, etc, those are all part of the fun.<br/><br/>Feel free to hit me up with questions if any specific ones occur to you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232886/#Comment_232886" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-17T14:55:51+00:00" title="September 17, 2009  2:55PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I'll also mention that I've decided I'm unimpressed with the "mode switching" Elf as provided in S&amp;W core.  I'd suggest using the more Moldvay like Elf from S&amp;W White Box.  I'm actually fiddling with my own Elf that takes inspiration from Moldvay .<br/><br/>A few more random thoughts. I've been using ascending armor class, but in the future I'll probably switch to descending armor class, with attack roll being 1d20+BAB+opponents AC &gt;=20.  To make this work, you have to increase BAB's by +1 over what is in the book.  The reason being that when using none S&amp;W material, you are constantly having to mentally convert between ascending and descending armor class.  The alternative would be just to go through your materials and pencil in the AAC beforehand.<br/><br/>Oh, and I totally think Fighters should get their first BAB bump at level 2, rather than 3.<br/><br/>And experience! I've come round to the notion that the Greyhawk derived XP awards listed in S&amp;W Core are far too weeny at low levels.  I've switched to the original LBB system as summarized here:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.philotomy.com/#xp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.philotomy.com/#xp</a><br/><br/>By the by philotomy's site is essential reading in fueling the thought process of putting together your own house rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232909/#Comment_232909" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-17T18:04:20+00:00" title="September 17, 2009  6:04PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I <a href="http://www.twitter.com/masterdungeon" rel="nofollow">run a Twitter game</a> that is based on Wilhelm's rules (although I ignore a lot of the mods, except the Fighter gets BAB bonus at 2nd level thing). It's fun!<br/><br/>GUIDELINES<br/><br/>Don't be afraid to give the PCs unbalanced challenges they can't beat through combat.<br/><br/>Don't be afraid to kill PCs if they engage said unbalanced challenges through combat. Corollary: Make it clear that this is an opportunity for heroism, but there is no guarantee that their characters will be the Great Hero. They might be the second guy on the left in the painting of the Great Hero. They might be the guy that gets eaten by the bear. There might not be a Great Hero.<br/><br/>Give more XP for loot than killing creatures.<br/><br/>Make the players think about encumbrance. Especially the 'Gold is really heavy' part. Corollary: Hirelings are fun (I don't know why).<br/><br/>Give the PCs as much and as clear information as you can. The game is more interesting when they are able to make informed decisions than when they just blunder around. Corollary: Clear information only extends to things it would be possible for the PCs to know. I like that there's no way to directly identify cursed items, magic items and potions without USING them. <br/><br/>RULES<br/>I used a 2-out-of-6 or 3-out-of-6 chance "skill" system when characters attempt non-combat actions. These rolls are modified by stat bonuses, working together, and clever/fun narration. The rationale is that the PCs are competent adveturers. I've found that players usually latch on to one or two things their character 'does'. Hey, roleplaying!<br/><br/>I use the S&amp;W Elves, but they change randomly at the start of every day. I find this makes them weirder and more chaotic. I like it that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233101/#Comment_233101" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-18T15:55:01+00:00" title="September 18, 2009  3:55PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bring extra character sheets or have pre-gens ready.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233187/#Comment_233187" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-19T09:56:08+00:00" title="September 19, 2009  9:56AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno, char gen in OD&amp;D is so quick that I think it's worth making part of the experience.

For the S&amp;W games I've run, I'm using the spell complexity rules from KS <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> - each spell has a chance of failure.  On fails, the MU forgets the spell; otherwise, they can cast it again.

Weapons are broken down to small, medium and large (large includes pole-arms).  Fighters do d6/d8/d10 with weapons, Clerics d4/d6/d8, and MUs d4/d4/d6. MU's do 1d6 when using a quarterstaff with 2 hands, and a -1 when using a large weapon.\n<blockquote>Of course, it does make ye olde sword'n'board fighter quite killy if you do that (d10 assuming you consider sword'n'board class appropriate) and extremely deadly with a pole-arm or two-hander (d12).</blockquote>\nWell, for mine, they don't get the d12, but other than that ... yep - fighters are a little more killy.  I also give Clerics on-the-fly spell decision (i.e., they get X # of spells per day, but don't predetermine them). <br/><br/>I as an aside, I also use the C&amp;C spell progression charts for the first few levels - Clerics can start with 2 first level spells per day, as can MUs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233290/#Comment_233290" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-20T11:48:27+00:00" title="September 20, 2009 11:48AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For my own part, especially given the potential effectiveness of certain low level spells (sleep, charm person come to mind), the OD&amp;D spell progression is perfectly fine. Since in OD&amp;D, even 1st level spellcasters can create scrolls given the cash, I think it is incumbent on spellcasters to use scrolls &amp; magic items to multiply their effectiveness.  It also leads to a different play style for different classes, the fighters can charge around and just do stuff, the wizards must lurk and find the right moments, and the most clever application of their limited power.<br/><br/>And be careful amping up clerics. They are already by far and away the most powerful class in OD&amp;D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233297/#Comment_233297" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-20T12:40:58+00:00" title="September 20, 2009 12:40PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            MUs also weirdly end up as the money men for the first expedition, IME, due to not having to buy much in the way of armor or weapons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233306/#Comment_233306" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-20T14:55:47+00:00" title="September 20, 2009  2:55PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I haven't found much balance issue amongst the classes so far.

It's got lots of his own house rules, classes, etc, along with a map and a gazetteer.<br/><br/>Anyway, in these rules, MUs are allowed to cast spells from their spellbook as a "ritual", taking as I recall 10 minutes.  MUs can only uses spells of 1/2 their maximum spell level, rounded down, as rituals.  So a 3rd level MU could start casting 1st level spells as rituals.<br/><br/>Clearly this hasn't lead to anarchy, as the guy has been running this campaign for decades.  It certainly makes spell selection less critical (memorization is now for combat spells, and low level utility spells, especially information gathering ones become used more frequently).<br/><br/>One thing to be careful of is boosting the amount of healing a cleric can dish out.

Since MUs have to lug that spellbook around, I figure clerics, with their armor and their good to-hit bonuses, can step it up a little and have to work for their Ritual Castings. <br/><br/>My main goal is, drawing on a bit of 4e D&amp;D, to limit the number of combat castings, but not to insist that a player ready Read Magic in the vain hope that he encounters magical text that he will need to read. I really like the idea of abilities being distinguished as Encounter/Daily/At Will in 4e, and this is a way to recreate that without drastically changing things around - kind of like my version of Elven Adventurers, wherein the character is a full fighter/MU hybrid, but can only cast spells when unarmored, putting a price on the added versatility (the switching-around of classes is too arbitrary to me).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251653/#Comment_251653" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-20T18:06:14+00:00" title="January 20, 2010  6:06PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 20, 2010 6:06PM by rafial.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Thanks for the reply, Wilhelm!

If you do, let me know how it goes.<br/><br/>I think the main impact that ritual casting will have will be to remove time as one of the resources you are budgeting.  The effect of ritual casting still goes on in standard play, once the characters are out of the dungeon, they can cast Detect Magic to identify items, healing spells, comprehend languages, etc at their leisure, but the the number of spells they can cast per day determines the downtime that must be spend to accomplish that.  That may be and issue, depending on what they are up to.  With ritual casting, it no longer is.<br/><br/>For my own part, I prefer emphasizing the ability, at least as implied in OD&amp;D and Holmes, for even 1st level magic users to prepare scrolls.  The costs involved are a great sink for the treasure that they should be hauling out of the dungeon, and it provides a similar "spell multiplier" effect. I don't require Read Magic to cast from a scroll (which is one possible interpretation of that spell, per S&amp;W and OD&amp;D).  If you've found my Thief class, you've surely already found my house rules, so you can see my thinking on that topic.<br/><br/>One thing I'm still working out is that in my own conception I dislike the idea of "scrolls" for Clerical spells, since they are never written down, but simply impressed upon the Cleric's mind by divine power.  But the OD&amp;D rules expect Clerics to be able to tap a similar spell multiplier effect by advance preparation. I've been pondering the notion of "charms" or "fetishes" taking the similar spell storage role for clerics.  My main issue at the moment is that such items would seem to be tied to particular god, and only usable by clerics of that faith, but that hampers the ability to provide such generic items as treasure, which is also an expectation of the OD&amp;D environment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251955/#Comment_251955" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-21T21:10:43+00:00" title="January 21, 2010  9:10PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm kind of interested in the scroll preparation idea, but I have to admit that I would like MUs to be the money men for the group in general (depending on how things go), as that means they'll be the ones paying for hirelings, and I am all about hirelings at the moment. They seem very interesting in their plot applications!<br/><br/>As far as Clerics and scrolls are concerned, I see no reason why a talisman couldn't serve as a de facto "scroll" - it's a one-shot thing, it costs the same as scroll creation to "endow" the talisman, or whatever, etc. Alternately, you could have "sacraments" - replace the actual scroll with implements for a religious ritual, such that some or all of the implements are consumed, sullied, or otherwise expended by the sacrament. Maybe the censer needs to get re-blessed by a high priest ($$), the incense is used up, etc. For my part, I think Clerics seem a touch overpowered - what are your thoughts? Certainly if they have less versatility in spells than MUs, that could help, but, especially at lower levels, they're more or less Fighters that are a bit touchy about what weapons they use, plus magic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252117/#Comment_252117" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-22T14:33:46+00:00" title="January 22, 2010  2:33PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            rafial,<br/><br/>  Would mind posting a link to your blog with the thief class and house rules?

I also gave dwarves the standard XP progression used by fighters, seeing as it sure isn't a "penalty" if things only get tougher for dwarves at or above level 6. <br/>I also straightened out elves - they can wield any weapon, wear any armor, and cast MU spells, ANY day of the week, but the rules for MU's casting in armor (i.e. they can't) still apply to elves. I added in a quick proviso (to put on or remove armor requires one round per 2 points of AC provided by said armor) to give a work-around for the player who simply must! cast and fight in the same battle.

The two-handed sword is crazy uber if you use the AC vs Weapon mods (and the chart in my house rules is toned down from the one in Greyhawk!)<br/><br/>I'm in the process of redoing my class tweaks (I want to put together one page for each class that I can hand out that merges my tweaks with the standard class). I'm redoing SR progressions to more closely map to OD&amp;D, as my feeling is that S&amp;W characters get screwed on common SR at low level (but do better at high levels).  Since the lions share of my S&amp;W play is low level, I'd like to get that back in line.<br/><br/>As for dwarves, I'm pretty satisfied with the stock dwarf (will probably kick HD up to 1d6+3), but the mode-switching elf is annoying, and the F/MU ala Holmes is too ueber at low levels, and then takes forever to level up.  So I'm going to be moving to something closer to the Moldvay elf, as given as an option in S&amp;W Whitebox.  (I'd almost consider rebasing to Whitebox, except that I really like varying damage dice for weapons).<br/><br/>Zac, I like your rule on shedding armor in combat.  Could also be useful rule to have when characters fall into rivers as well <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Also, on the subject of Cleric, yes, they are without question the best class in OD&amp;D.  Not only are they sweet at low levels, but their have the best XP/effectiveness power curve of any class.  Now that you've reminded me of this, I'm no longer as concerned about restricting Clerics to using only "scroll-equivalents" prepared by their own religion.  That lets them arsenal up from their own resources, but means that opportunistic spell finding is a perk for M-Us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252189/#Comment_252189" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-23T07:14:17+00:00" title="January 23, 2010  7:14AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't figure out why people like the variable damage dice. 1d6 for all weapons is really cool if you ask me.<br/><br/>Anyway, on-topic, I've got a house rule for magic users and clerics. They have to prepare their magic ahead of time, "hanging" spells or praying for benedictions or whatever, then they can use them at any time. It takes a full turn per spell to do this. They can load a number of spells equal to their level at a time. They can also just cast a spell immediately after preparing it, so it's not necessary to guess what crazy shit you're gonna need.<br/><br/>Partially this is a color thing, because I think the idea of memorizing and forgetting spells is kinda silly. But it's also a gameplay thing. Way I see it, time is the primary resource in 0e. As time passes, you face wandering monster checks. And, since wandering monsters don't have gold, they aren't worth XP. Which means they're just a drain on your gold-finding resources.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
