Wicked Age tells you to make them up yourself, and pretends it's easy.  You can only use one wicked age power at a time but if you're smart in Red box Hack you can use lots in the same fight.  <br/><br/>That's right - IAWA tells you to be dumb.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
