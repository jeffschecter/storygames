I was thinking that it would be fun to draw on some of the great American road trip books for inspiration, plus maybe some genre fiction like Amber or the Dark Tower series to glue it all together in a fantastic setting.  So you'd have a disparate group of travellers venturing into a weird version of Hunter Thompson's Las Vegas, then some snippets from The Road, then On The Road, and maybe some Huck Finn in there, too. <br/> <br/>I'm wondering how to keep a game like that moving and not just have it degenerate into picaresque little adventures, and how to keep some kind of theme and Fronts since part of the road trip is that you keep moving forward and keep seeing new territory and new people?                  </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423631/#Comment_423631" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-01T17:38:42+00:00" title="November  1, 2013  5:38PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe the Fronts could be tied to the road trip itself, rather than the transient locations?  I.e. things they are keeping one step ahead of, or questing for, trying to catch, etc?  <br/><br/>I've been in AW games with a Driver that have suffered when the characters can say 'we get into the car and leave' in response to the Bone Plague breaking out in the hold, or Dremmers Marrowfiends stepping up their raiding.  Do you see the characters as having particular reasons for traveling, or just because they can?  Maybe threaten those reasons and goals?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423632/#Comment_423632" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-01T18:03:33+00:00" title="November  1, 2013  6:03PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 1, 2013 6:03PM by catty_big.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not to question your choice of system or anything- if you want to run an AW game then obviously you should go right ahead and do that- but have you considered running <a href="http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/portfolio/ribbon-drive" rel="nofollow">Ribbon Drive</a>?

There's much to learn about road-trip play from trying out those two, very compact one-shot games.<br/><br/>As for AW, theoretically it should run what you're proposing just out of the box, if you just have an appropriate mixture of character playbooks. However, my actual-play experience always focused on small sedentary communities as the most natural outcome of character selection... You could sidestep that by defining (and, to a degree, mandating) a <b>nomadic</b> community as the focal center of play, instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423660/#Comment_423660" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-02T18:44:13+00:00" title="November  2, 2013  6:44PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't use *World, it's bad for games where you must constantly leave the situation.<br/><br/>I think when most people think "road trip" they think of a very small number of people.  There are plenty of properties that do road trip things: Star Wars, Firefly, Wagon Train, etc., but the situation people get into shares the stage with the ensemble (most of the time).<br/><br/>The classic road trip property is Route 66, or maybe Alias Smith &amp; Jones.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423668/#Comment_423668" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-03T03:01:42+00:00" title="November  3, 2013  3:01AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JDCorley's post suggests me that <i>The Drifter's Escape</i> and all of the <i>Trollbabe</i> family of games might be relevant here: games about a main character wandering into a new place &amp; situation, interacting with it and leaving anytime \u2014 but always leaving it changed. <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> is "the" <i>Trollbabe</i> descendant with an interacting cast of main characters instead of just a lone wanderer.<br/>To do that with AW, what you have to change is prep: instead of a single large all-spanning tangle, you prep small loaded situations, mostly self-contained, but each ready to explode. The instructions in AW are not especially useful for this, but if you don't jettison all of those then you'll be building overarching plots and hidden link between adventures, without even thinking of it: basically you have your Fronts, unaltered, but as an MC you don't go looking at those very often, and you look at those while prepping more often than while playing.<br/>The prep instructions in <i>Drifter's</i>, describing the building of a loaded situation seed on which the arrival of a foreigner without any ties pours instant gasoline, might provide you a starter for prepping the individual "adventure" situations\u2026 as could the general concepts in <i>Trollbabe</i>. The town creation procedure in <i>Dogs</i> is like a platonic ideal of what you could develop after some trial and error: a very tight "how to" to building the local situation, specific to your game.<br/><br/>In my previous post I maybe misread you and thought you were focused on "road trip" as the coming-of-age or inner growth story of a small cast of characters, with the external backdrop of travel (meeting many different places and people over a relatively short timespan) providing the fictional instrument of such growth (but not being really important <i>per se</i>).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423704/#Comment_423704" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-03T20:30:00+00:00" title="November  3, 2013  8:30PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, I have heard many good things about Ribbon Drive but I'm not big on naturalistic roleplaying and, more importantly, I don't have a face to face group and do all my gaming with Play-by-Post.  That makes Ribbon Drive unworkable.  I like the idea of running the game with DitV or Trollbabe, although the default mode for Trollbabe seems to be that the PC's go their own ways and cross each others' paths, Sorcerer-style.  I'm not sure how it would work with all the Trollbabes driving around together.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
