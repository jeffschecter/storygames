But its one of the grand old institutions of the hobby, so I don't often find that position something I can bring up without fearing ostracization. I swear, this isn't entirely an outsiders opinion. I've played <i>CoC</i> a handful of times, even took a hand at running an adventure. And all my actual-play experience just reinforces my criticisms.<br/><br/>*A significant portion of the concrete rules of the game, and the statistics of both PC's and NPC's are about combat, but combat isn't just the least important aspect of the game, its actively discouraged.<br/><br/>*The discouragement of combat is not actually explicitly mentioned in the corebook. Weapon stats are. So are monster stats. its casually easy for a referee to see shotgun stats on one page, and how many hit points a ghoul has on another, and assume the game is about investigators applying the former to the latter.<br/><br/>EDIT: So can the players. When I ran the game, one of the players, entirely new to <i>CoC</i>, put all his skill points into gun skills. Not because he had munchkin tendencies, but ... why wouldn't he? There wasn't anything indicating that wasn't how the game was played.<br/><br/>*The other mechanical stats of the characters outside of combat are just as meaningless. There's a group of "Find Clues" skills, which get cycled through serially every clue-based encounter until at least one character gets a success that lets them get the clue token. There some physical stats that don't matter, because most of the antagonists of the game either ridiculously overpower them or have special abiliities that circumvent them. Then there are miscellaneous skills that seem to exist mainly to get players to say things like "hey, I have horsemanship, I go find a horse to ride ... on this steamship."<br/><br/>*My impression is <i>CoC</i> gets its good reputation because its consistently attracted high-energy story-minded GM's. People who blow through the system's paltry mechanics to dazzle the players by telling the story they were going to tell anyway. Actual experience with GM's and writers of the game has not dispelled this impression.<br/><br/>*This is the pattern of every single <i>CoC</i> adventure I've been in: I'm handed a pre-gen of modest ability and indifferent knowledge of the supernatural. For the first third of the adventure, I and the other characters get to poke around as we choose, regularly handed clues by the GM we were mandated to find anyway. This is justified by rolling dice, though there does not always appear to be causality. In the second third, we are informed bad shit is moving around us and our direction becomes constrained. Defensive tactics will be formulated, which will prove meaningless, and there might be a fight with mooks, which won't actually change anything. In the final third, the GM quickly takes ever more narrative control, extolling what horrible things are happening around you while you just stare at them helplessly. Depending on how we acted in the earlier parts of the session, we are informed of the different ways are characters are doomed. I assume clues found in the first part are shown to have some kind of relavence by the end, but by that point I'm usually too bored to notice.<br/><br/>*This is also the explicit pattern of every pre-written scenario I've read.<br/><br/>*I'm actually okay with the Sanity mechanics in theory, but in practice they encourage farcical player behavior. Competing for who achieves the coolest madness symptom. Debating who has enough remaining SAN points to open the ominous door. Maneuvering for what are, essentially, "Cure Light Madness" buffs.<br/><br/>*Probably the biggest issue: I find investigation and mystery scenarios in a role-playing context inherently boring and problematic. Its a established narrative structure, so anyone with even the slightest genre awareness knows how things will play out already. Unleashing a team of typical ingenious players on such a scenario, who are willing to try any and everything to solve the mystery as directly as possible, pushes the GM to rely on fiat to preserve the mystery until they're ready yo end it. Its a set-up that breeds adversarial GM'ing.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422696/#Comment_422696" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-10T11:45:13+00:00" title="October 10, 2013 11:45AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of course, you have just described every shit game of Call of Cthulhu I've ever played.

I'm a huge fan of the literary corpus, however, and I enjoy the literary qualities of CoC gaming material, so I often wish that I had the mental constitution for playing the game. It is, however, exactly as you say: CoC is a game for prima donna GMs who don't mind carrying the whole weight of the circus on their own shoulders. I find it a clever observation that the game's reputation and success as a cultural phenomenon is largely explained by the best of the GMs being attracted by what it is.<br/><br/><i>Dread</i> is in fact the perfect rules set for playing CoC, I think. Unlike BRP, Dread is designed to function in exactly the way that CoC has to work in practice. It has the auteur GM, and it's motivated by that same "I've got this cool story that I want to share with my players, I'm going to scare them shitless" creative agenda that CoC features. Maybe I should try to just take some of the more interesting CoC adventures, run them through the Dread scenario prep wringer, and see how that'd work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422698/#Comment_422698" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-10T11:55:34+00:00" title="October 10, 2013 11:55AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like what you like, it is no big deal.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NathanHill" title="NathanHill"><img alt="NathanHill" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/917/nAZLTLHXP58YO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NathanHill">NathanHill</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422700/#Comment_422700" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-10T12:01:31+00:00" title="October 10, 2013 12:01PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Haha.<br/><br/>I have issues with CoC, and I love it too.

Dynamite and shotguns in sufficient quantity will also handle a huge number of problems in most of the modules.<br/><br/>Also, I think your characterization of module play as being focused on a single path through the scenario is off. If you read Call of Cthulhu modules, most of the time (outside the initial setup) there is no mandated clue trail. (This is a GUMSHOE trait, where it's integrated more effectively into the structure of the game.)  Most of the time there are different locations/people who can give you different clues. When you're done you might feel "oh I bet that was the only way through the adventure" but I've virtually never run a Call of Cthulhu module without having some handouts still behind the screen when we reach the conclusion.  We actually did a firm quantitative analysis of over 100 Call of Cthulhu modules and determined that while railroading is significant enough over the history of the game to say it's an issue, it's not the predominant style of modules. <a href="https://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17532/analyzing-call-of-cthulhu-module-chokepointsrailroading/p1" rel="nofollow">The discussion thread.</a>  The <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18081/call-of-cthulhu-module-railroading-survey-results" rel="nofollow">results thread.</a>  If you don't want to click/read, about 20% of published Call of Cthulhu scenarios had identifiable railroading in them - significant but not overwhelming.<br/><br/>Now some things the OP is dead-on target about:<br/><br/>"Staring at bad things you can do nothing about" is absolutely the core literary experience of Lovecraft "protagonists" (we must use this word in its broadest possible meaning because most Lovecraft protagonists are really nothing of the sort).  So yes, absolutely, you ought not play a Lovecraftian horror game unless you want this experience to some degree.  (The Dreamlands scenarios are even worse this way since the source material is basically a travelogue.)<br/><br/>Similarly, if you don't like investigation/mystery in RPGs, don't play this game.  (You're 100 percent wrong about them being inherently flawed though - you just don't like them.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith" title="E.T.Smith"><img alt="E.T.Smith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1090/buddyicons/8542318@N07.jpg?1180909196"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith">E.T.Smith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422706/#Comment_422706" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-10T13:42:47+00:00" title="October 10, 2013  1:42PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>CoC is Basic D&amp;D set in the 1920s with a mystery to be explored replacing a dungeon to be explored.</blockquote>\nActually ...

I recognize that my dislike for mystery-based games is a personal bias, but I also think CoC has the particualr objective problem of setting up players with old-fashioned sandbox-conceived characters (not too different from the direction characters would be conceived from in old <i>D&amp;D</i> and <i>Runequest</i>) but then pushing the GM to engage in freeform narrative building. Basically, the system tells players "here's resources with which to explore and change the world objectively" while telling the GM "the world is subjective to your story needs."<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422709/#Comment_422709" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-10T14:11:04+00:00" title="October 10, 2013  2:11PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 10, 2013 2:45PM by komradebob.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wait, didn't you say you were handed pre-gens on a regular basis?<br/><br/>There's a bunch of stuff you already dislike that's core to CoC.<br/><br/>Fine and good.

Actual experience with GM's and writers of the game has not dispelled this impression.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>EXACTLY!<br/><br/>It is the high quality of the GMs rather than the rules that make CoC fun. What I noticed about the game is that the sanity rules and the spot hidden skill are the fun parts, combat never works.<br/><br/>I played CoC in 1981. And the reason why I liked it so much was 1) it was not D+D, 2) But it enough like D+D that I knew how to play it, 3) it was horror - the first horror game, and 4) the idea of using skills rather than leveling up was new and alternative then (even if largely irrelevant to play). It was after all a Runequest game stuck on a horror setting.<br/><br/>Why it has remained popular is a good question. I tend to think that it being first accounts for most of it. Then come the GMs working around it to make it work. And lastly, Lovecraft's stories that rightly are wrongly are linked to the game. <br/><br/>I don't think reading the rules would make you like the game better. The fun doesn't come from the same source as fantasy. The fun comes from going insane but still saving the world in your last dying gasp. <br/><br/>For my own entertainment I've been working on Cthulhu World, my AW horror hack. I'm focusing on the fun parts, the slow death by a thousand pin pricks. Combat is down played but coming up with a plan to save the world is there for the last act. Where people can screw their roll and pull a win by an act of noble self sacrifice.<br/><br/>If you'd be interested in cutting apart the rules to help me find out what doesn't work, I'd love it. <br/><br/>Chris Engle<br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422711/#Comment_422711" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-10T14:52:17+00:00" title="October 10, 2013  2:52PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think there's much on your sheet about changing the world, objectively or otherwise.

The Call of Cthulhu games I've played in and run don't sound like even the objective side matches up with E.T. Smith's descriptions. As others have said - there are some GMs and some published modules that enforce predefined linear plots, but there are also many that are otherwise. For example, physical stats and combat have generally made a difference in games that I played. There were often clues that we missed (by bad luck or choices), but also choices we made to change the later confrontation. <br/><br/>The mechanics are far from ideal, in my opinion, but they are a common language that may work better than other options.

You report it as having only 1% market share.  Yet according to the <a href="http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/wotcdemo.html" rel="nofollow"><b>1999 WotC survey</b></a>, 8% of the players surveyed played it monthly.  Can you cite where you got your 1% figure?  Incidentally, this makes it the #8 of all TRPGs in that survey.  Further, the <b>Gaming Report Top 10 survey</b> found it #1 among Gothic/Horror RPGs, beating out even Vampire: The Masquerade.   It has been continuously in print by the same publisher for over 20 years, with a vast and high-quality line of adventures and supplements.  <br/><br/>By any objective measure, I would say Call of Cthulhu is a success, and people like it.  If your theories tell you that CoC is broken and unpopular compared to other RPGs, then I would suspect that your theories are flawed rather than the game.  <br/><br/>That said, I certainly have no objection to your designing an alternate Lovecraft-based RPG done in the way which you would enjoy more.<br/></blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422743/#Comment_422743" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-11T09:08:21+00:00" title="October 11, 2013  9:08AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 11, 2013 9:19AM by komradebob.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Is 'just play Cthulhu Dark' the wrong advice here?<br/><br/>CoC exists the way it does because it came out in 1981.

In CoC you may spend quite a bit of time agonizing over exactly how to spread around your skill points to create a Biologist, wondering exactly which of those skills is going to be important to the adventure. CD just says: Write down a sentence describing your character. If Biologist is an important part of the concept make sure it's in there. When it's time to make a roll, we can all probably make a reasonable guess about whether that should give you a die, a bonus di, or we can reasonably simply let you skip the roll altogether.]<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422745/#Comment_422745" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-11T10:16:18+00:00" title="October 11, 2013 10:16AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I do not like the game <i>Call of Cthulhu</i>. <br/>In fact, I'll go so far as to say I find it deeply flawed in many aspects, and I'm mystified at the popularity it has.</blockquote>\nI know where you're coming from. In some ways, I feel the same, although I'm more positive about it.<br/><br/>It's a very old game. It's very mechanical and stats-heavy, with a focus on combat (because, in those days, RPGs were close to wargames). Most of the things you're saying, I think, are simply because it's a very old game.<br/><br/>Despite all that, I still think we should give it credit for Sanity mechanics. They're really good. In their day, they were very innovative.\n<blockquote>*My impression is <i>CoC</i> gets its good reputation because its consistently attracted high-energy story-minded GM's.</blockquote>\nThere's some truth in that. I think that <i>playing Cthulhu</i> is much more about the GM and the scenario than the mechanics. You could play a Cthulhu game without the CoC mechanics.<br/><br/>(In our terms, I think the "system" is more about the GM than the written rules.)\n<blockquote>*This is the pattern of every single <i>CoC</i> adventure I've been in: I'm handed a pre-gen of modest ability and indifferent knowledge of the supernatural. For the first third of the adventure, I and the other characters get to poke around as we choose, regularly handed clues by the GM we were mandated to find anyway. This is justified by rolling dice, though there does not always appear to be causality. In the second third, we are informed bad shit is moving around us and our direction becomes constrained. Defensive tactics will be formulated, which will prove meaningless, and there might be a fight with mooks, which won't actually change anything. In the final third, the GM quickly takes ever more narrative control, extolling what horrible things are happening around you while you just stare at them helplessly. Depending on how we acted in the earlier parts of the session, we are informed of the different ways are characters are doomed. I assume clues found in the first part are shown to have some kind of relavence by the end, but by that point I'm usually too bored to notice.</blockquote>\nThat sounds really shit.

They don't have to mean railroading.<br/><br/>But I think it's a fair cop that a bunch of published CoC scenarios are weak at having meaningful investigation. I've read too many featuring "muddle around for a while until you manage to scrape up the time and place to go for your bossfight."<br/><br/>I think Robin Laws' design choice for the Gumshoe system (underlying Trail of Cthulhu et al) is fundamentally correct: we want randomness in situations in which both success and failure are interesting. Failing to get information is not interesting, so don't make it the subject of a dice roll. If a character has a relevant skill that could yield the info and uses it, the character gets it. The challenge is interpreting the clues, not finding them. Gumshoe as a whole still hasn't clicked with me, but that principle will govern any investigative scenario I run. <br/><br/>JD, would you consider publishing more of the raw data so we could see which scenarios were considered to have (or not have) which problems by how many people?

The best roleplayers flock to those games at conventions, in particular, instead of singing up for the D&amp;D-battlemat-dungeon-crawl. So the energy is often very high, and a great time can be had.<br/><br/>There's a sense of the inevitable (the Lovecraftian story has a very predictable shape to it), and everyone plays up to it as much as possible. You get to be theatrical and cool and describe crazy scary stuff and act out a character going mad. People who do this well have an awesome time: it's intense celebratory roleplaying of a type of story everyone involved loves. The rules are generally ignored, and no one minds a railroaded story because we all signed up to enjoy that kind of story to begin with - in Forge terms, it's highly theatrical Participationist play focused on celebrating a very specific kind of Colour.<br/><br/>I've never played in a CoC game which is run "by the book" (as opposed to trying to replicate Lovecraft's stories0, with investigators putting lots of points into Gun skills and then using dynamite to blow up Cthulhoid terrors. It sounds fun in principle, but, for my tastes, would require an entirely different ruleset.<br/><br/>I think I would best enjoy CoC using the Cthulhu Dark rules or Dread, as Eero suggests.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422766/#Comment_422766" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-12T07:17:18+00:00" title="October 12, 2013  7:17AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's definitely a bend for those folks who enjoy CoC to treat it as an experience that they are happily and gladly signing on for when they play an adventure.<br/><br/>Worth keeping in mind: CoC as a game is a bit like D&amp;D as a game. They start with source material as inspiration, but over time they really become their own thing as it relates to gameplay traditions. So yes, CoC adventures tend to have certain shape to them.<br/><br/>Ignoring rules vs. Playing by the book<br/><br/>I dunno, this is a tricky subject. The more I look at early RPGs especially in the time when they break out of the wargamer ghetto and into the hands of non-wargamers, the more I look at them as helpful tool kits and less as proper games or proper rules.<br/><br/>Truthfully, I'm pretty okay with that, viewed from that particular lens. I've said before that I started with CYOA books as a kid, and viewed RPGs as a better sort of CYOA game-conversation-story-play pretend hybrid monstrosity. I still look at those early games and suspect that, well spoken aloud or not, a whole lot of people treated them that way as well. Also, lots of people probably still do treat them that way.<br/><br/>CoC play, from what I can tell from experience, very much tends to fit with that mindset. Yes, there's a story. There are different paths to take, and a few possible variants of ending to it. Along the way, what mechanics that exist are almost entirely optional in their usage but that is also <i>in keeping with how they are intended to be used</i>. There are a few things always rolled for, a few things we roll for mostly to detail things out and we want a little bit of randomness and fun in there, and the dice throws add some tension.<br/><br/>Insider/Fan gripes about CoC<br/>There are things I don't like about CoC. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The skill lists are overly long and overly specific, and in older editions there isn't good guidance on what skill levels should be to represent competence.</span> Academic character types actually tend to suffer a bit more than action-hero types during chargen because of the peculiarities of trying to suss out which skills will become important.,<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">There's a weird inverse relationship between how important a skill is ( and therefore how high it should be) and how often it's likely to get rolled for. </span>If you get into combat, a pistol skill of  25-30% is perfectly adequate. After all, you'll likely be rolling that repeatedly. Hitting someone 1 in four times you fire under combat circumstances in the real world makes you a fricking deadly killer.<br/>OTOH, you really might want to take Pilot at as high a number as the GM lets you get away with. It rarely comes up, but when it does, you want to pass that damn test with very few failures ( that whole unscheduled air/ground interface thing being a bit tricky).<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CoC just doesn't tend to work well with the endless, open-ended campaign ideal laid down with D&amp;D, nor does the whole Zero to Hero competency progression.</span><br/>Completely personal opinion of course. In some regards, CoC is (in the old editions I've played) a little too close to D&amp;D, although some of that is mostly player expectation. Even more than old D&amp;D, it's not a forgiving game when you go toe to toe with the baddies, and no you aren't playing to get rich, and no your starting character is not going to end up vastly more powerful in the greater scheme of things. OTOH, your character probably does start a bit weaker than they really should be rated because of those things I mentioned in the last two points.<br/><br/>Can you play campaigns in CoC? Sure you could, but it tends to work even better with short bursts of adventure- one shots and short arcs. Played like a pulp detective agency or some key character that always seems to wind up in weird spots ( and pals), with adventures treated as the next appearing magazine short-story ( The Case of the ...) and it seems to work okay. Long, open-ended, sand-boxy? Not so much IMO.<br/><br/><i>The D&amp;Dism of the unconnected character doesn't work all that well either.</i><br/>If characters can't be connected to the plot, they should at least be connected to one another. Almost every CoC adventure I've ever seen goes into weird detail on how to get characters involved. As a one-shot ( a great format for CoC), they'd almost always be better with connected-to-plot pregens. It's just that the concept is incredibly foreign to role-players generally.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422767/#Comment_422767" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-12T07:56:55+00:00" title="October 12, 2013  7:56AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But somehow, despite all the gripes, Call of Cthulhu is one of the most popular games around so it's probably doing something right.

A lot of people love Call of Cthulhu; to the point that there seems to end up being a bit of an impasse whenever people criticize it. Conversely, a lot of criticism of CoC tends to get pretty impassioned, maybe because there is so much love out there that people end up going really over the top when they do say anything critical about it.<br/><br/>Call of Cthulhu is tremendously popular. A lot of people (me included) love the setting, and for a long, long time CoC was the only real anti-DnD. The cool kid in the leather jacket who read Kerouac and saw himself as the antihero. That is no small factor in its appeal.<br/><br/>I guess I'm a bit of an anomaly--I started on Moldvay DnD but didn't play my first CoC game until three years ago. I really like the Mythos, and I like the atmosphere of the game. But I'm not particularly invested in the mechanics of CoC, or the heritage of the Chaosium line.<br/><br/>From my perspective, there are many sensible criticisms you can make about Call of Cthulhu. I find BRP to be a pretty clunky system, actually. First, the rulebook really is arguing for a game that doesn't exist--its own combat mechanisms tend to make the proper strategy for anything below greater Servitors "shoot first, shoot often, and don't let it talk." Humans of course fare even worse, especially if you use all the spot rules (I think most people forget that there's an unconsciousness roll you need to make when you take enough damage.)<br/><br/>Second, there are a lot of skills, they aren't all that well delineated, and the implication of the rules is that all the skills are "success vs. failure" checks. I mean, I'm not surprised that a 1st Gen system has lousy stakes-setting mechanisms; but it creates fail points that require clever GMing to get around. CoC has been accused of strongly fostering illusionism, and it certainly looks like that could be a consequence of the rules; whether or not it is in play I think depends on the group and the Keeper.<br/><br/>Finally, and this is just my own taste, the system is really simulationist in a way that isn't my own particular style of play.<br/><br/>All that said, a lot of people still love the system. Our own Lisa Padol has told me that for her, the BRP rules get out of her way. I myself wonder to what degree this is a result of experience and tradition; like, I could run Traveller in multiple genres, and feel like the rules got out of my way, but that's because I've internalized them to a large degree. There's still plenty of clunkiness in most implementations of Traveller. (That said, the core system is pretty sleek--but then so is BRP's basic, "roll d%" system.)<br/><br/>I thought about all of this when I decided to run my Masks campaign. My original plan was to run it using Call of Cthulhu--in fact, I ran a preliminary one-shot (which introduced Jackson Elias) under CoC. But as I looked at the rules, I decided that I wanted to use a different system. For one thing, I wanted to keep the PCs around long enough that I could develop storylines around them--after all, it's long-form play, so you need some continuity. The language system was a mess. And there is the issue of the infamous "fail a check, lose the adventure" fail points in CoC. <br/><br/>Personally, I think that criticism is overstated. Good adventure design will get around it. Justin Alexander's three-clue rule works admirably for this sort of thing; and Masks itself does a darn good job of making sure the info will get to the players. But the potential exists inside the system for that kind of thing to happen.<br/><br/>In the end, I went with Trail of Cthulhu; I find I internalize the Gumshoe rules much better than CoC, and I can have my Mythos and a better system (for my tastes) too. But I have and would play Call of Cthulhu.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422799/#Comment_422799" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-13T15:47:21+00:00" title="October 13, 2013  3:47PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 13, 2013 3:48PM by Scrape.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the hell out of CoC and although I've grumbled about the rules previously, I will play devil's advocate and say some nice things about the system. Just 'cause I want to see them said. Some of this is a little tongue-in-cheek but I'm trying to look through the lens of history a little, here. Also I'm not mentioning the Sanity mechanic 'cause everyone seems to agree that it's fun. Anywayyyyy..<br/><br/>1. Skill progression is handled well. It's organic and natural: you improve the skills you use regularly.<br/>2. The BRP rules accentuate the "uncaring universe" angle. You want to outrun the eldritch horror in your jeep? Well the rules don't care about how bad you want it or what kind of story karma you've earned. The rules care <i>how well you can drive.</i> It's an uncaring world out there.<br/>3. Okay, so it's goofy as shit that they statted out the Elder Gods. Maybe we don't need stats for them. But... maybe we do? Again, it's impartial. If the Keeper says "no way, he's too tough to die" then maybe you feel cheated by fiat. But when the <i>book</i> says he's got a million hit points and eats 1d4 investigators per round... well shit, I guess we should've stopped the ritual before he got here.<br/>4. BRP was designed to be compatible between games, right? So combat is gonna be somewhat effective. But the rulebook talks big game about the PCs not solving their problems with violence. It goes on and on about better and more literary methods of success. That, in itself, is part of the rules text. It's telling you how the game <i>should</i> be played, which is a noble goal, right?

Loveraft\u2019s work is all based on the idea that knowing a terrible truth is enough to terrify you so much to make you go mad. Knowledge of things beyond us are the true horror, the creatures and cults are merely the embodiment of that horror. That is what the game has managed to subtly capture.<br/>\u2014PopMatters regarding "Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth"<br/><br/>  Perhaps this is where CoC falls short of the mark. The "terrible truth" is represented by a number (shuddering <i>unnameable </i> -1D4 Sanity!). I'm no expert on CoC but I had a few of the books 'cuz I love me some Mythos. <br/><br/>  But that's part of the problem; I <i>know</i> all the unknowable stuff (at least, as much stuff as has been revealed through stories and articles). A statted-out Hound of Tindalos is just a bad dog to be swatted on the nose with a rolled up Elder Sign. I know why Deep Ones are abducting women from the quaint sea-side town. And I can recognize the Innsmouth-look from a mile away. Brain in a canister? We're looking for Mi-go. They're approaching the status of Hammer Horror monsters (Dracula, Wolf-man, etc). It's like I've memorized the Monster Manual before I ever played D&amp;D. Robs the game of some of the mystery.<br/><br/>  As for violence, the quote above is quite appropriate. The creatures and cultists are just the symptoms, not the disease. Shotguns are no more the cure than rituals or spells.  The fight against the Great Old Ones is a war of attrition and we WILL lose eventually; all we can do is delay the inevitable. If I recall correctly, in a million years or so the Earth will be ruled by intelligent insects. Yes, Cthulhu was defeated by ramming a ship into him, but "that is not dead which can eternal lie". Devil's Reef was dynamited but that's not the end of the Deep Ones; hell, probably not even the end of that particular colony. Grampa Danforth always told me: " Don't bring a shotgun to a shoggoth fight; you'll lose every time".<br/><br/>  As for the long standing love of CoC; I can hazard a guess. Lots of folks (myself included) love the Mythos. For a <i>long </i> time CoC was literally the only game in town. The Public Domain status of HPL's stories is in dispute but the Trademarks held by Chaosium are not. Did anybody else have the original Deities and Demigods with the Lovecraft and Moorecock  material still in it?  I wish I held on to that; along with the Leiber/Lankhmar entries, it was the best stuff in the book.<br/><br/> I think maybe "DREAD of Cthulhu" might be the way to go.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422834/#Comment_422834" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-14T09:39:54+00:00" title="October 14, 2013  9:39AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>&lt;<br/><br/>Really, I'm not sure why the gaming community is so fixated on the archetypal Lovecraft protagonist being a weedy academic shuddering in an insane asylum, fleeing from any hint of direct action and occupying himself by mailing letters off to other weedy academics: that barely works in a short story, in an actual gaming session it's flat-out terrible.

You might win the adventure, but you were supposed to lose the war.<br/><br/>At least, that was the theory. Not sure if that's how it played out.<br/><br/>I know I wrote a whole post running it down, but I definitely admire CoC for being one of the first games where the plot <i>really did matter</i>, and wasn't just a coolness token gathering expedition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422860/#Comment_422860" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-14T21:01:41+00:00" title="October 14, 2013  9:01PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Here's what my ideal CoC character sheet would look like:<br/><br/>Put on your acting shoes and<br/>portray compulsion, madness and horror<br/><br/>Sanity: [#]<br/>This will guide your portrayal<br/><br/>[A billion stats in case it happens to come up who's the best driver or how good you are at wielding a trowel.]</blockquote>\nThat nails it for me!

I'm pitching a session to some rpg-neophytes, using a scenario from an old issue of <i>Challenge</i>*. This should at least give me a better idea if its mainly the <i>CoC</i> system or the genre that I have difficulty with. <br/><br/>*<i>Challenge</i> magazine was GDW's house organ from 1986 until the company closed, replacing <i>The Journal of the Traveler's Aid Society</i>. In its later years it expanded from covering just GDW products to other science-fiction games, as well as a few military and horror offerings, including <i>CoC</i> (basically matching the genres that GDW published in itself). I find them a good resource because Challenge's main focus was concise scenario outlines, 3000 words or less (two to four pages). Great for quick drop-ins or basic ideas to expand on. For <i>CoC</i> in prticular I prefer them over the Chaosium published stuff, where even a "short" scenario outline can ramble on for twenty pages. Specifically, I'll be using "Dance of Death" from issue 73, which includes some nice genre misdirection.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423080/#Comment_423080" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-17T17:20:36+00:00" title="October 17, 2013  5:20PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am with ET.<br/>I played amazing CoC sessions in my time... but I also encountered all of the problems he lists, many times, even in the good sessions.<br/>Eventually I decided the effort to get a good time out of it wasn't worth it.<br/><br/>But aside from personal taste, the one thing that today keeps me well away from CoC is the simple fact that (as usual with all Traditional rpgs) the game in itself means NOTHING.<br/>99% of the fun comes purely from the table-chemistry that may or may nor arise between you and the other players and the GM.<br/>The rules don't help a bit in this, and often get in the way.<br/><br/>Sorry, but nowadays I know better.<br/>And besides, if I have to rely on a "Good GM" to have fun, I can get the same result with ANY traditional rpg... from D&amp;D to Risus to GURPS to a stone taken from my backyard :P<br/><br/>If I want to play "a Lovecraftian rpg" my choice would go to Cthulhu Dark ... but I would not advocate such a choice for ET.<br/>True, CD cuts down to ALL the things ET perceives as problems in CoC... except one... which is where I think KomradeBob sees CD as being "an essentialist CoC": the story structure.<br/><br/>I've read the amazing book <b>Stealing Cthulhu</b>, and it offers a gazillion of great ways to redecorate and mix up the basic structure of an investigation... but in the end there is always a GM who has a "scenario" prepared behind the screen.<br/>And always the characters have to:<br/>- take the bait to start the scenario<br/>- find the first clues<br/>- be harassed in some way by some peril<br/>- find more clues<br/>- meet the end of the scenario<br/><br/>Now, CD makes it incredibly easier for the GM to avoid the need to railroad, either by being much more clear about what is expected from the Players, by giving the GM a way to effectively use a very minimal and vague preparation, by throwing in the mix the occasional unexpected twist (scoring a 6 on investigative rolls), by freeing the Players from the chains of "rules performance" in order to incentivate creative thinking and immersive play, etc.<br/><br/>But it still fits the basic investigative structure ET seems to dislike.<br/>I like it, and I <b>love</b> how CD handles things like combat (that <i><b>is</b></i> present and very dangerous; it just is in no way more [nor less] convinient to use than other approaches) and facing creatures from the Mythos (you either run or hide or concoct an inderect plan to deal with <i>the thing</i>) and bringing madness into play, and dealing with it (hide the truth!!!).<br/>But it is still: the GM has a scenario with an expected start, development and end.<br/><br/>I think ET could try to play the kind of investigative systems that do NOT rely on such a structure...

It does still go with the concept that Cthulhu adventures are structured a bit like a form of poem, and that the art is working within those structures.<br/><br/>For me, that's fine. Good haiku is good haiku, and part of the point is to work within the restrictions of the haiku format and see what you can do with it. Also I like haiku.

Some just can't get excited about horror games in general. Most horror games make you feel horror by giving you overwhelming odds against the player, but if the player is focused on "winning" the point of it is lost. <br/><br/>Keepers are also to blame too. By loosing the balance of the horror they bore the players. Too much opposition to where no one can win will cause players to be disinterested because they already know the outcome and it ends with them dead. Too little opposition and it becomes action genre, too much and it becomes the keeper piling abuse on the characters for no reason at all.<br/><br/>CoC is not about the ending, it is about the soul crushing descent and what it means for that character. The one flaw in the game is that it doesn't make the players use characters. The players involved are usually weird anti-social people that respond violently at the drop of a hat and make odiously bad decisions for no apparent reason. Kind of like the lady in a slasher film that goes into the basement alone, unarmed, and in the dark when she knows the killer is down there. Its more fun if you act like people act. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423351/#Comment_423351" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-25T01:20:30+00:00" title="October 25, 2013  1:20AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problem with that in a one shot is that the normal people arc tends to be <br/><br/>Stuff happens that may be normal - investigate<br/>Stuff happens that could be weird - investigate but justify as normal<br/>Stuff happens that is definitely weird - run around a bit and worry a lot try and find someone to tell you it's truly weird<br/>Big monster you were ignoring because you thought it didn't exist eats you - Om nom nom<br/><br/>I'd suggest for CoC the only way to avoid this in a one shot is to put in at least one character who is aware of the mythos already and credible enough to be listened to early.

For me, a Cthulhu version would include: a necronomicon/grimoire, a creepy librarian, an artefact of some sort, and my face being eaten by some 'orrible tentacled monster, oh and some 'orrible tentacled monster.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423354/#Comment_423354" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-25T05:50:15+00:00" title="October 25, 2013  5:50AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The question of exactly how much to metagame is an interesting one.

There is no "hero" in CoC. No one tries to stop the "monsters" till they are already neck deep in it and have no choice. Even then, your character is driven more by the will to survive than to "defeat the monster". Characters should  be motivated to do what a person would be motivated in the same situation. <br/><br/>Lovecraftian fiction is not character driven, but action driven. This is a common criticism of HP Lovecraft's fiction, actually. It is an action driven work that doesn't rely on any characterization whatsoever so that the reader can "put on" the character and imagine themselves in that scenario. This is the strength of CoC and HP Lovecraft's works. This is why a lot of people also don't get it. You are not a hearty adventurer who hunts down occultist monsters; you are an average person who thinks monsters don't exist. If you don't approach it this way, all criticism are correct; it is a bad action game where the monsters are overpowered.<br/><br/>If I offered you $100 to go in my basement and find out what was making a horrible slurping noise with an accused smell, would you?

Do you, as a perfectly sane and well adjusted member of society assume it is a great elder creature and get all the dynamite and shotgun shells you can and go down to do battle with the forces of darkness? No. Heck, you, the real you, would probably think I was up to something shady and not want to put yourself in danger.

You go up against the bad knowing that you can't possibly win, just delay the inevitable, probably at the cost of your own life and sanity, but for the benefit of others happily less enlightened than you.</blockquote>\nIt depends upon what you think is heroic, I suppose. I have never heard anyone say that a horror movie had a hero, but I suppose one could make an argument that the girl running from the serial killer in the middle of the woods could be heroic because she does stop him by the end... but she really didn't go there to hunt for a serial killer. She went there to go get a camping job at a camp ground with a tragic past. Nor did she mean to kill the killer ether; that always happens as a result of her running away with him getting hurt by obstacles. Ends justify the means, I suppose?<br/><br/>One can only be heroic if one acknowledges the truly hopeless situation they are in and chooses to go into a hopeless situation that they could avoid in my book. Most Lovecraftian characters do not acknowledge how hopeless their situation is (or even that it is supernatural in nature) till the end. This is why ignorance is a useful tool in CoC, and it is the only thing that gets a lot of Lovecraft's characters through their stories. A low insight keeps you sane long enough for you to act, but it leases you ignorant to what is going on around you. It is a mechanic that most people don't like because it keeps their characters from making objectively the best decisions they can make in the scenario so that they can be this hero or die trying. They usually succeed in dying whist trying in my experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada" title="Coalhada"><img alt="Coalhada" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada">Coalhada</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423400/#Comment_423400" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-27T01:21:44+00:00" title="October 27, 2013  1:21AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>Ok, you (the real you) establish it is not just a cat.

It's the same reason that old WEG d6 Star Wars has characters going from 2D in a skill to 2D+1, 2D+2, 2D+3 before reaching 3D, or why Advanced MSHRP has a character going from Excellent (20) to Excellent (21) instead of simply going straight to Remarkable (30).<br/><br/>Other than that though, I agree. Call of Cthulhu is an adventure game set in the worlds of HP Lovecraft. You go to investigate because that's the basic concept of what you're doing. In D&amp;D, you go adventure  because that's what it's about, not going off to be a blacksmith in a fantasy world. In Monopoly, you buy property and try to become the top, sole remaining slum lord/ real estate baron because that's what Monopoly is about.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423408/#Comment_423408" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-27T12:57:32+00:00" title="October 27, 2013 12:57PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The system is very old school and it's main feature is ease of use.

In almost every CoC character sheet they have some form of questions or spaces for the following information: Name, Occupation, Income, Education, Age, Sex, Nationality, and Residence. If one is to play an investigator who investigates for the sake of the investigation, as one plays monopoly for the sake of gaining land, then all this information is useless. You might as well leave all that out and put Investigor <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23__________&amp;Mode=like">#__________</a>. All that info for the character are hooks for the keeper to use to get you interested in the story least it is just a night of red shirted ensigns going to their doom. All RPGs require you to build a character, and they all go horribly horribly wrong when you don't act as your character would, however that character should act. <br/><br/>In my experience, CoC requires you to act like a normal slob who is caught up in something much much bigger than them, and every game I have played where someone has approached it as "I'm gonna hunt me a monster" ends with everyone involved being frustrated and unsatisfied. I just don't think it can be approached like that for the desired punch, but to each their own. If you can make it work as an action/adventure game, more power to you. As long as you're having fun; the game has succeeded. <br/><br/>I feel I'm being a bit negative on this thread, though. Let me pose this question in a thinly veiled attempt to turn it positive. What about the CoC games you played in the past "worked"? What made you enjoy them? Why did you enjoy playing them?

A well written adventure setup can involve everyone on their own level and make it more plausible that a detective and expert in dead languages are spending weekends together in decaying New England villages.<br/><br/>The best CoC games I've run have been when players really work hard at finding clues - they understand that every scrap of information might be helpful in figuring out what is at stake and what is going on. They get into it - and they really try to explore every avenue. I tended to do less rolling too and follow the Trails of Cthulhu way - if you got a competency in the skill, you discover something.

That's tough to do.<br/><br/>My favorite adventures have included ones from Coming Full Circle - really fantastic writing and fun stuff (though non-mythos). In particular, the adventures encourage an ongoing relationship with some NPCs over a period of time - so the following investigations feel more natural.</blockquote>\nI may have been unclear what I meant by normal slob. A cop is a normal guy, a professor, a doctor, a journalist, and the like are all normal guys (I have played RPGs with a member of each of those listed professions at some time or another). They are all average people with average behaviors (aside from the RPGs). Their skill set is specialized, but no more or less spectacular than say a mechanic or plumber. A nuclear physicist with a car that won't start is about as powerless as anyone else who has no expertise working on engines. <br/><br/>I was referring to people who drive characters to act as no normal person would, no reference to their skill set. For instance, if the cop in a rural area got a call because cows were killed in someone's field. The cows look as though they have been torn apart by a wolf and he ate the bits he enjoyed. Last night was a full moon. It is not a normal leap in the investigation process to assume that a werewolf is on the loose... unless you are playing CoC. Too many players know too much of the mythos and take leaps based on information that the character should not know or should flee from if he did know. All I am saying is it has to be approached with the assumption that the characters have to be ignorant of the danger and thus ill equipped to deal with it at the start of the scenario. Most scenarios aren't long enough for them to gain enough to deal with the true threat, and now we have a horror game instead of an action.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper" title="Ian Cooper"><img alt="Ian Cooper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/733/nRK18K7505XHK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper">Ian Cooper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423464/#Comment_423464" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-28T16:55:55+00:00" title="October 28, 2013  4:55PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>But somehow, despite all the gripes, Call of Cthulhu is one of the most popular games around so it's probably doing something right. </blockquote>\nAgreed. I think one problem with the Big Model is that if as a theory it fails to explain why CoC is popular, and continues to get play amongst people who are aware of and exposed to alternatives, then there may be problems with the theory. Even if that problem is expressed as: "a competent GM can makes a game very enjoyable even if a game does not match everyone's play agenda or they have to drift the game".<br/><br/>Personally, I'm not a huge fan of mystery in rpgs either, because the players have so many possible solutions that creating a 'right' one is always likely to lead to frustration for me, as the players grope for it. I tend to prefer options where the PCs investigations tend to direct what the solution to the mystery is.<br/><br/>But that's just me, and the fact that so many people enjoy CoC, suggests they get something from it that I don't, and I should not commit the fallacy of assuming that because I don't like it that style is obviously broken.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423467/#Comment_423467" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-28T17:53:38+00:00" title="October 28, 2013  5:53PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I don't know where this thread went.

They should act normal at first, but the spiral leads them deeper and deeper in. If the players are jumping the gun, I can see it being a major distraction. A good CoC game definitely has a lot that the rules don't capture - there is an unspoken social contract at times. You have to just get it.<br/><br/>But I'd be curious too how many gamers first really got into Lovecraft through CoC, because it can be a great game to play when you don't have any clue at all what is coming next. You can count me as one of those who played it before reading any mythos-related stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SteveDave" title="SteveDave"><img alt="SteveDave" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/267/nLSFO0MJD2Z0T.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SteveDave">SteveDave</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423491/#Comment_423491" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-29T09:33:10+00:00" title="October 29, 2013  9:33AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had already read a bunch of Lovecraft before playing CoC, personally.

There is more actually hunting the monster yes and not every game is about dealing with the realisation that supernatural things exist. But still the Delta Green stuff I played or looked at Actual Plays of was concerned with atmosphere. If we define "monster hunting" as just going for the kill and rolling dice.<br/><br/>Trail of Cthulhu makes the difference betweena purist game and a pulp game and offers slight variations of the rules for each. You decide what you are going for during character creation usually. So everyone can build their characters (and the scenario) towards the goal. But I guess monser hunting would fall under the pulp umbrella.<br/><br/>In CoC I usually try for the atmospheric horror but if the adventure makes it possible swing towards the pulp when the chemistry does not work out. Sometimes the players just wont get scared or the mood is not there in some way. In that case why not bring out the shotguns and dynamite?<br/><br/>I did read Lovecraft before playing Call of Cthulhu first but not before being aware of the games existence and where it got it's inspiration. I would not have discovered Lovecraft at that point in time if it hadn't been for the RPG. But like Sandy Petersen I more often draw my ideas from modern horrorfilms than Lovecrafts stories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423508/#Comment_423508" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-29T17:58:47+00:00" title="October 29, 2013  5:58PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an interesting question:<br/><br/>Is it possible, anymore, to run a CoC game which is intended as a surprise for the audience?

So it would be hard to find players to get in cold.<br/>I did play CoC with some players before who had roleplayed the first time that day and only had a vague idea about lovecraft. They of course knew it would be some kind of horror and I explained some things about the game before. So they did not go in as a complete suprise. That happened on two different occassions and both times the players did some unorthodox things, some of which would not fit the genre completely.<br/>In one game, with a single new player, it turned into a more fun and pulpy thing by the end, with rabbis headbutting giant bugs. But still was fun. It decendet into some kind of madness, just more of the zany kind.<br/>The other game, this time with two new players, it made them freak out pretty much and lead to a rather disturbing scenario. My GMing was better that day and the atmosphere just managed to go into horrific territory. They expected some X-Files stuff I guess or something similar. The scenario was early Cold War Delta Green maybe they really were suprised and losing that footing managed to create the frightful atmosphere. They really did not know what to expect. The characters in the end decendet into madness and some of them choose the blaze of glory way out, while others clawed for their lives with all they had.<br/><br/>I made the experience in general that playing rpgs with people who are new to it and do not have their conceptions of how to play set in stone usually creates cool results. They often do approach problems and situations differently. Especially in games that are their own genres in a way, like D&amp;D, Vampire or Call of Cthulhu. But sometimes it can lead to not playing the game like it is usually played, Call of Cthulhu turning into zany pulp for example.<br/>I think you get the genre more reliably if you play with people who know how to play to it. Especially since the structure of the game does not really push you into the direction of the genre all that hard from a player perspective.<br/><br/>A certain enjoyment comes from knowing the tropes and seeing them done anew. But i a way that also turns some games into appreciation of handiwork instead of genuinely being creeped out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SteveDave" title="SteveDave"><img alt="SteveDave" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/267/nLSFO0MJD2Z0T.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SteveDave">SteveDave</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423511/#Comment_423511" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-29T20:31:14+00:00" title="October 29, 2013  8:31PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>A group of mainly monster hunters probably feels the same about the one holdout who insists on delaying the action by poking every possible clue and making melancholic monologues.<br/><br/>I'm just being glib, but the observation gets me to wonder something.

I like games like Cold City that are more geared toward monster hunting as well, but its a different animal altogether with CoC. There are a lot of people on this thread that are complaining about how CoC isn't working or is failing to amuse them. I am just suggesting things that worked for me, and I am pointing out specific issues that came up in games I played that I feel robed a myself and others an enjoyable experiance. It just doesn't seem like a lot of the people on this thread are satisfied with their CoC experience. I am telling you why I think this is; take it or leave it. <br/><br/>I don't think there is a "right" way to pay a game, but if you are playing Hot Guys Making Out with a heterosexual married couple as the main couple, are you really playing Hot Guys Making Out? Its just not the same game and additional changes have to be made to the system to accommodate it. Not saying that's wrong; that is how new games are made, though.<br/><br/>As for what people should do with their games; play it, enjoy it, and if you don't find out why and change it if you can; if not play another game. There are too many flavors out there, and if you don't like elder god flavor you can have 1000 different verities; check, you probably do so without leaving the genre.

People who have never heard of Lovecraft's mythos have no expectations for a game based upon it... or so I would think. Are you looking for someone to undo a misconception about the game and mythos?<br/><br/>If people would "get" a game is a good question, but that is the million dollar question, there. Could you do that with any game out there? Could you have a bunch of people get a game of Dogs in the Vineyard who had never been heard of a western? Could people who had never been exposed to Tolken inspired fantasy get D&amp;D? Would someone who never saw a kung-fu movie be able to make any sense out of a combat system that allowed people to balance on chopsticks for a foot hold, take 12 kicks to the face, and fight 32 armed people at the same time, but they aren't able to use magic? <br/><br/>I think you have to buy into the fiction behind the game first, or at least I do. I can't see anyone enjoying fantasy football who doesn't enjoy football. They might be out there, but all fantasy football leagues tend to be populated by the kind of person who enjoys a game. Why would it be any different for any other game?<br/><br/>Do you play a game in a genre you aren't familiar with?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423513/#Comment_423513" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-29T21:45:46+00:00" title="October 29, 2013  9:45PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 29, 2013 9:49PM by Biest.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there is a difference between broad genres like "Western" or "Fantasy" and say "Lovecraftian Cosmic Horror". So someone who has an idea about Horror as a genre but none about Lovecraft might still be suprised a little, like my players in the Delta Green scenario were. But that is more of a subgenre thing.<br/>I think some people who have say been only exposed to eastern fantasy or say space operas might be able to get into D&amp;D. Doing the heroic quest thing as a group.<br/>Depends on if it is the whole group too, who has to get the genre from the book, or if it is just a player or two in the group.<br/><br/><br/>I did play some anime based stuff and superhero stuff where I was the one in the group with the least genre familiarity and only the most basic ideas. But not sure if I got it right and it did not inspire me to follow up on that genre more. Well it really is genre variations. It is Anime Action or Anime Romance, so I can get in from the regular genre, once I realise that is hiding behind the japanese name.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423515/#Comment_423515" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-30T02:13:36+00:00" title="October 30, 2013  2:13AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You shouldn't need to know the mythos to have a good game of CoC, back in the day (when all this was fields and we wore onions on our belts as was the fashion) I picked up 1st ed CoC at the tender age of 12-ish largely thanks to the picture on the front of the box.

Namely: you get a much bigger disparity of gameplay among different GMs using the same rules, than you do with the same GM using different, even COMPLETELY different rules systems. I don't have evidence on hand to support this claim, but I would love to do research along this vein. It would explain a LOT of the arguments and grognardiness surrounding the hobby, most of which centers around different groups getting wildly different results out of the same rules systems. Rule systems can be analyzed and broken down, but we have no codified way of analyzing someone's GMing style or skill. In this example, I would submit that if you have a bad GM, there is no edition or ruleset which is going to make Call of Cthulhu fun; conversely, if you have a good GM (and here's the kicker) ANY ruleset will result in a fun game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SteveDave" title="SteveDave"><img alt="SteveDave" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/267/nLSFO0MJD2Z0T.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SteveDave">SteveDave</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423571/#Comment_423571" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-31T13:48:42+00:00" title="October 31, 2013  1:48PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is an element of good GMing that is intrinsic to the game, but there is also an element of good players in general.
