Having done this, players then go back and play the scene, adding mostly color ( dialog, etc) to an already-known series of events. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Considered a negative term</span> ( much like <i>Railroading</i>). Origin in movie making, then applied to gaming.<br/><br/>*Also often games with dispersed GM duties</blockquote>\n<br/>So, I've been thinking about this recently. I know some folks already do something like this ( I believe that Emma Ex's games almost always work this way, if I understand correctly).<br/><br/><br/>I want to use it for a game that, well, is kinda movie-inspired anyway, and where more distant player stances ( author, director) are the norm, rather than the more commonly seen actor stance.<br/><br/><br/>How can I make this work and have it still be a source of interest for the players, and how and where can I still leave creative vacuums and perhaps some bits of randomness is resolution mechanics to keep things interesting?<br/><br/><br/><br/>The floor is open                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484503/#Comment_484503" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-28T14:29:27+00:00" title="May 28, 2019  2:29PM">May 28</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not directly it but close : propositions.

Systems with conflict resolution  do this to some extent. Systems with advancement clocks do this to another extent. I prefer to let anything go : some ideas will fly, others will wither, other emerge mid-scene. Scene framing is never a problem when the stakes (and the boundaries) are clear . <br/><br/>Presenting propositions as questions is useful for a number of reasons. The main is that everybody gets how it works when you put it this way :<br/>Will the volcano destroy the village ?<br/>Will Janet rescue James from the shed ?<br/>Who is the mysterious figure James saw in the distance ?<br/>Will Janet burn in the flames ? <br/>Will they kiss ?<br/>etc.<br/><br/>Altering propositions eschews the whole idea. But you can merge and schism them as long as you don't make babies to simple logic. Which in the end can get you the same result as altering them, but I've never seen that. It really depends on the system you put around.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caroline_Hobbs" title="Caroline_Hobbs"><img alt="Caroline_Hobbs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/121/nILD1Q33E03N4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caroline_Hobbs">Caroline_Hobbs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484509/#Comment_484509" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-28T17:56:37+00:00" title="May 28, 2019  5:56PM">May 28</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of my very favorite games, <a href="http://www.lamemage.com/friends/My_Daughter_The_Queen_of_France.pdf" rel="nofollow">My Daughter the Queen of France</a>, does this.

They are used to "playing out" a preset plot, storyline, dialogue, or going into scenes with an endpoint in mind.<br/><br/>RPGs have long been all about "the freedom to do anything you want!", as a way to differentiate them from other "games", so that idea can be foreign to gamers.<br/><br/>As for historically:<br/><br/>I remember when <i>My Life with Master</i> was written: it certainly wasn't a "story boarding" game, but it had a defined endpoint in the form of an "endgame". This is, to some extent, the first explicit formulation of this kind of thing in a well-known RPG (unless we include D&amp;D's "level limits"). It's not just that there is an ending to the story we're heading towards... it's the whole idea that the game <i>has an ending in the first place</i>. Shocking, right?!?<br/><br/>The basic assumptions of RPG play from the beginning were that a) "you can do anything you want", and b) that you're "going to keep playing this campaign together forever".<br/><br/><i>My Life with Master</i> was received by a lot (most? many?) of gamers as a heresy. "That's not a real RPG!", went the cries. The whole idea that the game had an ending AT ALL was sacrilege, and fundamentally anti-RPG, in their minds. (I bet a lot of people still feel this way!)<br/><br/>Now we have a lot more variety in game structures, which I think is really cool. We have endgames, we have Destinies in <i>Archipelago</i> (we don't know anything about your character's story, except that it will end <i>like so</i>), we have games with formal Act structures (like <i>My Daughter the Queen of France</i> and <i>Witch</i>), and so forth.<br/><br/>Of course, in some ways, the traditional "Illusionist" (railroaded) D&amp;D/trad game is a form of this, in a way, too. It's just not very explicit about it, which can be a problem (though not for everyone!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484534/#Comment_484534" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-28T20:54:55+00:00" title="May 28, 2019  8:54PM">May 28</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DeReel" rel="nofollow">DeReel</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Why not let everybody make all sorts of propositions ? ;P</p></div></blockquote>\nThink of my version of the mechanic as the training wheels version.<br/><br/>Do that first, then, once you have that down ( as a play group) take off the training wheels and throw them away and go way more freeform, as you suggest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484535/#Comment_484535" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-28T21:23:58+00:00" title="May 28, 2019  9:23PM">May 28</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience with games like Shinobigami is that players tend to take to this really quickly once they get over that initial "Wait, what do you mean I'm in charge of what happens?" hump.<br/><br/>It's all the fun of GMing without any of the overwrought handwringing about how hard you work and how nobody appreciates you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484537/#Comment_484537" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-28T21:36:24+00:00" title="May 28, 2019  9:36PM">May 28</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/komradebob" rel="nofollow">komradebob</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" rel="nofollow">EmmatheExcrucian</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>You are correct that storyboarding is a major component of my play. </p></div></blockquote>\nHave you ever had a problem explaining the fun that goes with storyboarding to people used to more traditional style RPGs?<br/><br/>How did you get that concept across to them.<br/></div></blockquote>\nI wouldn't say I've ever adequately explained the concept to people more into traditional style RPGs, unless some of the people here count. My group is all fiction writers and freeform roleplay people who were fundamentally unhappy with traditional RPGs the times they played them, so there wasn't really any explaining with them. It was more of a "Hey, here's a game that does things the way we want to do things. Let's all learn it and play it together", you know?<br/><br/>I feel like if I were trying to explain it to more traditional people, I'd probably emphasize it being a completely different activity. It's not a traditional style RPG. There's not really even any shared DNA, unless you're really digging into a lot of complex stuff with the history of role-playing, and thinking in an extremely galaxy brain way/ <br/>I'd describe it to a traditional RPG person as being a combination of fiction-writing and experimental theatre. It's writing the scenes and acting them out on the fly, with exact wordings being improvised, and things being played in an experimental style where actions are described instead of performed.

The names are escaping me, but I know it's a thing I've read about. <br/><br/>If I were explaining it to people already versed in storygame-type stuff and other experimental RPGs, I'd compare it to jeepform, but with mechanization that allows us to write our own stories and use mechanics for multiple stories instead of having to just stick to individual published scenarios. Kind of like a jeepform system, but with more mechanics than jeep typically uses.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484538/#Comment_484538" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-28T21:39:54+00:00" title="May 28, 2019  9:39PM">May 28</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>It's a very interesting topic.<br/><br/>I think Emma is our "resident expert" on this sort of play!<br/><br/>For people who "get" this, I think, the most naturally, are people trained in acting/theatre/television.

Storyboarding is outlining and planning scenes. Playing through scenes is actually writing them. For the sake of the metaphor, it's putting the words on paper. <br/>Writers with some casual interest in acting is I think who I would say most intuitively "gets" it, you know?

I think there are rules around who frames the scene vs who decides how to resolve the scene, and you get a different colored dice depending on how the scene is resolved (it's been a while). But we threw a lot of that out because everyone wanted to involve the rest of the group in planning the scene.<br/><br/>It was a lot of fun and no one was like "hey wait a second this ISN'T an rpg, I've been duped!". I actually think there is something comforting for new players about getting group buy in and knowing what's going to happen.

How to carry other characters without compromising your own, stuff like that. Part of framing scenes with this in mind, I think, entails having a lot of open space for how something's going to actually get done, even when the structure of the game demands it does get done.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484553/#Comment_484553" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-29T00:37:33+00:00" title="May 29, 2019 12:37AM">May 29</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I was going to say something about character autonomy, but then I realized that a lot of games that fit into this space (including some aspects of Emma's games, I think) don't really care about character autonomy.

Even when I don't necessarily follow someone's suggestions directly, you're collectively this great sounding board that helps me talk through to solutions<br/><br/>First off, Character Stable ( or just Stable) are great terms, and I may well end up using that somewhere.<br/><br/>To be less mysterious, I'm working on a GMless/GMful design, that has something like modules or at least adventure starters that are handed off to the play group. The whole thing is Hollywood themed. That's the conceit anyway: The players are a group of developers, trying to take a bare bones outline and concept and turn it into a film.<br/><br/>So it's one-shot ( at a time), semi-cooperative, but the challenges are in the following things:<br/><br/>1) Whatever is created needs to balance novelty with clich\xe9.<br/><br/>2) There is play against the clock. There are a limited number of scenes and a limited amount of real time to play the game, and post-play wrap up procedures are must haves<br/><br/>3) Individual players need to balance putting their stamp of creativity on the thing with the success of the project as a whole ( see point 2 above).<br/><br/>That barebones outline/concept sheet includes characters (or character types) that almost certainly will be in the film, as well as implied characters. None are completely developed ( they'd have, one, maybe two sentences of description). Some may not have much in the way of names or motivations or background. That's part of what players are supposed to develop/evolve during play.<br/><br/>Buuuutt\u2026 I also think I want players to have groups of characters that they have first dibs on when comes to playing the characters in scenes. And those groups of characters should also be set up in a way that two characters by the same player are unlikely to be in a scene together ( unless the second has a very minor roll in the scene).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>So yeah, I don't even know what to call that. A stolen film-making or play-writing term would be great.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484800/#Comment_484800" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-31T13:24:25+00:00" title="May 31, 2019  1:24PM">May 31</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Why do you need to distinguish that from "no character monogamy"?

Yes, get into the characters' heads because it creates greater dramatic situations in scene setting and hopefully better, more memorable character dialog. OTOH, you want to be removed enough to be able to send that character to their utter ruin during the course of play and be happy doing so.<br/><br/>So, removed stances. Very often Director stance for all players during play.<br/><br/>OTOH, any given player probably largely in charge of 2 major and/or supporting characters and 1-3 minor or supporting characters or walk-on, one-line extras. That player is expected to develop those characters and portray them in scenes. In theory, I guess they could pass them off or swap them over play, but it would never be with a goal of de facto reducing their stable to a single character.<br/><br/>Likewise, another player can never directly take over portrayal of a character in your stable without your permission. That of course ultimately means they can't kill a character in your stable without permission ( or without some sort of mechanic being engaged).<br/><br/>This? I have no idea what to call that situation.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484809/#Comment_484809" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-31T15:41:25+00:00" title="May 31, 2019  3:41PM">May 31</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why do you need a special term?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484868/#Comment_484868" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-31T21:36:22+00:00" title="May 31, 2019  9:36PM">May 31</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It would make it easier than explaining each time it comes up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484872/#Comment_484872" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-31T21:40:23+00:00" title="May 31, 2019  9:40PM">May 31</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you\u2019ll still have to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484873/#Comment_484873" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-31T21:40:39+00:00" title="May 31, 2019  9:40PM">May 31</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sometimes having specialised terms can help hammer home the fact that a certain activity or idea is fundamentally different from what you've become accustomed to!

Suggestions welcomed.<br/><br/>I think I'm going with DeReel's suggestion of <i>Stable [of characters]</i> until and unless something even more Hollywood sounding comes along. It's functional.<br/><br/><br/>What I had considered was coming up with a more firm way to decide which player ends up with which characters in their stable initially.<br/><br/><br/>I thought vaguely about having a process with a list of characters, starting in order of assumed probability of appearance/importance to the game. It of course includes characters at odds with one another ( since it is GM-less).<br/><br/><br/>Round 1 of choosing characters starts with any player, then proceeds clockwise.<br/><br/><br/>Round 2 goes counterclockwise and involves choosing another character that has a relation ( what sort? ) to the character of the person to your right.<br/><br/>Round 3 goes clockwise, and you choose a character that has a relationship (What sort ?)to either of the characters owned by the player to your left.<br/><br/><br/>By that point, assuming there are 3-5 players, that's a lot of semi-named/developed/conceptualized characters. I have no idea if anything else at all is needed for even more minor characters or if they can be left as created-as-need One-line extras later in play.<br/><br/><br/>That is, literally, as far as I got. I was half-asleep. Anyone want to help me flesh that out into something fnctional?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
