I want more animals to show up in my games!  But animals tend to fall a little flat.  They are furniture - sometimes scary like an Ottoman, but ... flat.  Like this week's zombie game - my guy is in the Seattle zoo, and shazam!  There's a lion on the loose, licking his chops!  So I run from the lion.  Lion almost catches me but not quite.  Lion gets a tranquilizer dart in the rump and becomes zombie food.  On to the next thing.  <br/><br/>How do I invest animals with menace, intrigue, personality, and hidden meaning?  Where's the fun in giant snakes, an army of furious dolphins, or a mangy, sad-eyed puppy?  <br/><br/><i>(Soundtrack to this thread provided by <a href="http://www.crustaceanrecords.com/mp3s/Thesesnakesgethigh.mp3" rel="nofollow">Awesome Snakes</a>, courtesy of Crustacean Records.)</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145730/#Comment_145730" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T13:06:24+00:00" title="May 23, 2008  1:06PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How do you do those things for people characters?<br/>\n<br/>\nJust like that, I'd expect.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe shark in Jaws didn't act like a shark, right?

I once played a Sorcerer game where the PC was a bandit slave who had just been liberated.  He ends up kidnapping the lord of the land's daughter and then sets out to take revenge on his former enslaver.  It comes to the point where we have this ex-slave, the lord's daughter and the bandit king out in the deep deep woods together when all of a sudden a pack of wolves attack.  The ex-slave PC is the only character who's armed.<br/><br/>In your case I would watch for situations where (a) real humans are in conflict either PC vs. NPC or PC vs. PC or even NPC vs. NPC with the players near by and (b) zombies are already complicating that situation when...

Act like they misheard something you said.<br/><br/>Then, really slowly, say, "You're going to shoot the snake?" Give the player a chance to either change their mind or boldly blast its head off.<br/><br/>Don't have it writhe or anything. Just have it die. A little gory, nothing dramatic. Just a cold, sudden death-by-face-shooting.<br/><br/>And then, an hour down the road (IRL time), go for an "oh snap" moment:<br/>1.) Crazy Woman Jenny agrees to help you out. In fact, she's got the necessary trinket in her cave home right now. Her pet snake is guarding it. Her pet snake that she loves dearly and would definitely, definitely avenge if it ever got hurt.<br/>2.) The scientist figured out the cure! All it requires is fresh mint leaves (easily obtained) and purple cobra venom. What's that, purple cobra is a near-extinct species and only one has ever been recorded in the area? And you just KILLED IT?<br/>3.) Everyone has nightmares of snakes sliding down their throats and getting stuck that evening.<br/>4.) The exact same snake, with the exact same nick in it's face, is in the next room. And it isn't dead.<br/><br/>Right? If the players don't want to humanize the animals, then don't sweat it. Just humanize the world around them (suggestions 1-3). Or, play off the fact that they are bizarrely not-human (suggestion 4).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145767/#Comment_145767" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T15:11:05+00:00" title="May 23, 2008  3:11PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, you guys!  <br/><br/>Thanks for the feedback.

The party was climbing through a rocky pass, and their archer was scouting ahead.  He sees a mountain lion looking over the ridge at him.  He glances back to check where the rest of the party is, and when he looks back, it's gone.  He knows it's stalking him.  He stands completely still, and just listens, and thinks.  We played a whole conflict between him and the lion without him seeing it at all, until the last minute when it sprung from hiding, right behind him now, and he, ready for it, spun and put an arrow in its neck before it could reach him.<br/><br/>The player said he'd been genuinely creeped out by the ecounter.  I think it was the way I played up the animal's ability as eerily powerful, but not supernatural.  There was a "man against nature" vibe as well as the awe that <i>it's just that good</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145773/#Comment_145773" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T16:10:50+00:00" title="May 23, 2008  4:10PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            this isn't really on topic, and for that i apologize, but... it's funny, i think.<br/><a href="http://xkcd.com/107/" rel="nofollow">http://xkcd.com/107/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145808/#Comment_145808" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T19:23:01+00:00" title="May 23, 2008  7:23PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I'm gonna go with "failure of imagination".

We've done it before with storms, and ships, and all kinds of things that wouldn't marry your sister.

If it passes, you can choose to have your character with that fear, or suffer some small penalty if you go against that.<br/><br/>Further, when it goes to convince them of fear - go into detail. Think of how a thug would try and convince you to be afraid - the threats he'd use.
