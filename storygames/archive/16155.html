We tell stories all the time. <br/><br/>But even amazing storytellers I've met, people who are professionals and do this for a living, have a really hard time with the collaborative part of collaborative storytelling. Working together to tell a story is its own unique challenge. <br/><br/>D&amp;D is quite brilliant. It's way easier to tell a story if you have a clear character, motivation, and situation. And the rules allow for collaboration in a functional, non-bullying way that is so amazing... people don't even realize they're actually telling a story collaboratively while they are doing it! Story doesn't really enter into it. Just do whatever makes sense to you, moment to moment, given the constraints you are given. Constraints foster creativity. But D&amp;D hides constraints as features! <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, D&amp;D (like everything) has problems. For example, note how some of these features can fall apart outside the brilliant structure of combat or dungeons. But this also highlights how the structure that does work is awesome.<br/><br/>I should also be clear that these potential problems are mainly with freeform collaborative storytelling. Structured collaborative storytelling can avoid these problems, depending on the structure used. The problems I've seen with freeform collaborative storytelling are similar to: <a href="http://gamingaswomen.com/posts/2012/03/game-design-and-sexism-player-feedback-mechanics/" rel="nofollow">http://gamingaswomen.com/posts/2012/03/game-design-and-sexism-player-feedback-mechanics/</a>. This is partly why I love GMing so much. I can circumvent these bad habits, make people comfortable, and encourage collaboration. <br/><br/>I think the best way to explain roleplaying is skip explaining and just do it in a low-committal situation. <br/><br/>"It would be easier to just show you. Do you have 5 minutes?"<br/>"What are some TV shows or movies you like? Did you see [X], [Y], or [Z]?"<br/>"Cool. Who's your favorite character?"<br/>"What is something that happened to [NAME], or something [NAME] did that you wish was different?"<br/>"Ok, imagine you are [NAME]. Just like [NAME], you are [X], [Y], [Z]" (name details to get the person emotionally engaged).<br/>Then describe the situation their character is in. Use the situation that the person said they wish turned out differently.<br/>"Ok [NAME], what do you do?"<br/>Then throw in a twist that didn't happen in that TV show or movie tied to their actions to make it clear their choices (and roleplaying) matter.<br/>Watch their eyes light up.<br/><br/>For Game of Thrones fans, I have the person play Jamie Lanister and put them in the situation at the very end of Season 1, Episode 1. Ok Jamie, what do you do?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368466/#Comment_368466" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-19T10:45:18+00:00" title="March 19, 2012 10:45AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jamie, we've added a point to the Talk we give at Story Games Olympia:<br/><br/><b>Say the obvious thing.</b><br/><br/>When it is your turn to give creative input, don't worry about saying the perfect thing.

You need to learn the rules like with any other game. You will make mistakes. It will probably take more than one session to get it right.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Don\u2019t be sheepish. Don\u2019t try to second-guess what the game or the designer wants you to do. Make the game your own. Try to strike a note that rings well with you and your fellow players. When the rules say A and your (collective) gut says B, go with B.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Don\u2019t be lame. Many Hippie Games are very easy on the players, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should be easy on yourselves.

You cannot learn the game if you cannot allow yourself to express your own skepticism, because at the same time you need to <i>sell</i> the game to your annoyed fellow players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369276/#Comment_369276" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-26T15:16:59+00:00" title="March 26, 2012  3:16PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 26, 2012 3:17PM by Will_Hindmarch.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love this thread already.

You have a sword and a pouch with a magic potion that will turn you invisible for five minutes if you drink it. You're standing at the door to a big stone castle. What do you want to do?"<br/><br/>10,000 ft.: "This is a game about Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It's just like the TV show, but we're making up our own episode."<br/>10 ft.: "So, you're Buffy, with your Slayer strength and fighting ability, and you have a book bag filled with stakes and holy water. You're walking through the graveyard at night, and you hear some strange noises coming from a crypt ahead of you. What do you want to do?"<br/><br/><b>Under-promise and over-deliver.</b> YES: "This is a game."

It is light-hearted, the player doesn't always have to describe what happens and when they do, they are given license to be good, amazing, etc.<br/>\n2) These are games where table talk improves the game, not detracts from it. If you have an idea, blurt it out. Just don't get discouraged if it doesn't stick...<br/>\n3) There is a tendency to get writer's block or whatever. If it is just a matter of a person being shy, stop and give them a chance to think about it. If they are stumped, give them a suggestion<br/>\n4) When you are told in the rules to describe an outcome/whatever, pretend you are the GM for a moment.<br/>\n5) Have fun<br/>\n6) Try and make sure others have fun<br/>\n7) Use the first idea that comes to mind, if everyone is following these rules, someone will make it awesome!<br/>\n8) Don't get caught up on Story Games vs Traditional Games, etc. All of these divisions are immaterial to your experience at the table. Don't bother with terminology/story games sales pitches etc. They only appeal to a cetain crowd and the people at your table may not be part of that crowd. For instance, if I want to play Dogs in the Vineyard, I tell people "It is like an A-Team of wild west Paladins that have six-shooters instead of swords." Most people get it instantly and can tell you if that sounds interesting to them. As opposed to "A mormon wild west that never was" which has never sparked interest in anyone I know...<br/>\n9) Don't try and sell people on what is different about these games, sell them on how much less work it is for the same or more amount of fun.<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369765/#Comment_369765" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-28T13:50:39+00:00" title="March 28, 2012  1:50PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Frank T</cite><br/>2) Don\u2019t be sheepish.

The trick is, you can't be a rules nazi and never deviate from the rules and you can't be a rules hippy and never follow the rules. You have to be somewhere in the middle. But generally, you are going to want to know how the game was designed and then drift it, if it is no fun (instead of assuming). Not because the designer knows how to make you have fun, but the designer tested it and came up with the best design they knew how to make. In the end, it may not be fun for you, but at least try it before you mod it, maybe it will be fun, who knows?<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_370097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370097/#Comment_370097" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-29T19:51:05+00:00" title="March 29, 2012  7:51PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 29, 2012 7:59PM by Meserach.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mathalus</cite><br/><br/><b>Say the obvious thing.</b><br/><br/>When it is your turn to give creative input, don't worry about saying the perfect thing.

It will come quickly to you, so you don't have to panic during the freeze and it will seem amazing to us, because what is obvious to you will surprise us ('cuz your brain is different than ours).<br/><br/><br/>This point helps players relax a bit. Repeating it at the beginning of every meetup is a good reminder that we are here to have fun and that just participating is half the battle.</blockquote>\nThis is strong advice.<br/><br/>I'd add:\n<ul>\n<li>Don't try to be original - many people self-censor out of a desire to be seen to be creative or original. Nothing's original.</li>\n<li> Don't try to be good. Be average. People who are trying hard are tense. People who are being average can be comfortable.</li>\n<li>"Failure" can be more interesting than success - if we wanted all the roleplayers to be like yourself and never do anything other than what you would do, then you wouldn;t play with them, right? SO a choice that I myself view as surprising or odd <i>is the whole point</i> of getting you to play.</li>\n<li>Create a safe space for doing it "wrong" - here's where your choice of game, and choice of setting within game, can be crucial. I like InSpectres because the premise is wacky and off-the wall, so almost nothing feels inappropriate for someone to advance.</li>\n<li>Accept their suggestions with enthusiasm - if this provision worries you because "what if they say the wrong kind of thing", you should probably play a different game.</li>\n<li>If they fail in way that really genuinely doesn't work, audibly and enthusiastically blame yourself - this helps convince them it's not their fault. Remind yourself, and them, that this is their first time, so no-one expects them to be good at it. Ask them to compare to their first time doing other activities that they're now good at (dancing, playing the piano, whatever) - hopefully you'll raise a smile, and a knowledge that early inept attempts don't preclude the idea of later good ones.</li>\n<li>It's okay to fail - if something's a mistake or problematic, we can walk it back.

I do not think that is commonly accepted here, though. <br/><br/>Maybe a little bit of clarification, my point is not about <i>figuring out</i> the rules. It is about what to do if the rules get in your way. In that case, I say, "you know best what's good for <i>your</i> game, ignore the rules, play your own way." Whereas Matt and many other SG regulars say, "the designer knows better than you do what's good for <i>his</i> game, follow the rules, play his way."
