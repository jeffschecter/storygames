Each monster is given a 'normal' human cover story, but can also be called upon to resolve 'unusual' problems: it's like Eureka populated with Universal Monsters and a dash of The Americans.<br/><br/>Here's the design question: the system calls for (at least) three thing the PCs care about, on both a personal and a global level, but so far, I've only got two that seem like a good fit.<br/><b>Secrecy:</b> Maintaining cover, both personally and in the general sense of keeping the existence of monstrous being out of the public eye.<br/><b>Safety:</b> Staying healthy and also preventing collateral damage, especially the sort caused by rampaging beasts.<br/><br/>So, what's the third issue in this triumvirate? I've got this one, but it just doesn't have the bite of the previous two:<br/><b><i>Status:</i></b> Maintaining your personal relationships &amp; job security... can't think how this would apply on a global level though.<br/><br/>Any better suggestions for a third issue?

Secrecy protects them from unwanted attention from outside, Safety  protects them in a very physical sense, and Community protects them from each other. It's obviously a very personal want (on the same track as Paul's Acceptance/Love/Belonging), but I feel the desire for a more global community is also something that hidden groups like these strive for, especially if there's pockets of monsters living elsewhere in the world (be they wild or in 'the Russian Eureka' or 'the Japanese Eureka' or whatever).<br/><br/>Maybe that works for you then? If going with the S word thing, "Secrecy, Safety, Society"? I think community has more of the connotations that work here, but doesn't have the same poetic ring as an alliterative triplet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451490/#Comment_451490" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-21T12:27:16+00:00" title="February 21, 2016 12:27PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>As a side remark: are you familiar with the daikaiju movies?

Like a human would stick with a boring job just for the comfort of a regular paycheck, it seems to me that these monsters might have a reason to accept their new status.<br/><br/>They are no longer a threat because, well, it's much more comfortable to live under cover, to maintain Secrecy and Safety - these guarantee that they won't be hunted and put down - and because they realize that this is so much more comfortable (or satisfying...) than just go ahead being the lonely monster against all humanity, and be eventually defeated.<br/>As long as they stick to the plan, and don't blow their cover, they can keep being monsters - within reasonable limits.<br/><br/>I don't know how much you want to push things, but for example if I think of a vampire in such situation, I would say that Secrecy would fit the vampire in a very natural way. Then, Safety would be a natural part of the deal with the government; like the older vampires making sure the new recruits would not go around sucking blood from innocent citizens.<br/>But in the end, no vampire would accept this unless enough fresh blood was provided as part of the deal with the authorities, somehow.<br/><br/>This issue of Comfort (or again, Satisfaction) also presents a great deal of potential for turning things sour: what happens when the monsters don't get what they "deserve" as part of the deal?<br/>Do they accept being exploited?<br/>Do they drown in sorrow and powerless despair? (Do they make the humans exploiting them look like the real monsters?)<br/>Do they step up and revolt, becoming wild, uncontrollable monsters once again?<br/><br/>(Let me know if I am going off-track here)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451518/#Comment_451518" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-21T20:34:22+00:00" title="February 21, 2016  8:34PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Satisfaction is potentially interesting, because you could have a monster who has aspirations of becoming a famous painter, or writing an autobiography.<br/><br/>(Apologies if that's drifting away from the genre in question; I'm not familiar with it.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451523/#Comment_451523" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-21T22:33:33+00:00" title="February 21, 2016 10:33PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How would Satisfaction work on a global scale, in addition to the local/personal?<br/><br/>Hey James, have you seen the Syfy show Sanctuary (starring Amanda Tapping)? It aired the same year as Eureka, and deals with a lot of these themes, though with slightly more fantasy monsters and less 60s B-Movie ones. The central concept is a secret home for monsters in Unknown City, run by a woman trying to both help them hide and survive in a world that fears them or, when necessary, seal up the ones thatprove uncontrollably dangerous. The first season involves a lot of travelling to capture various Abnormals (so maybe not the gameplay you're looking for, though it IS typically other Abnormals doing the capturing), but the general conceit of the secret home for monsters is quite similar. If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451526/#Comment_451526" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-21T23:22:54+00:00" title="February 21, 2016 11:22PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You assume that all PCs care for those things.<br/><br/>1) what happens if they behave in a way contrary to that?<br/><br/>2) what about the PLAYERS?

There would be occasions where a PC was unable or unwilling to uphold all three, through their actions or decisions, but that triumvirate would still form the core principles of play.<br/><br/>If a player joins that game but wants to play a serial killer or just a bar-owner who gets into comedic scrapes, they can play out that role for a session or two, but it is unlikely to be a satisfying experience for them, as the system doesn't support their desired style of play: if I've pitched a game about cops, then there is the expectation that the PCs will be cops, because that's the experience the system is designed to provide.<br/><br/>It comes down to player buy-in and using rules that drive a certain type of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451607/#Comment_451607" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-23T18:03:41+00:00" title="February 23, 2016  6:03PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Much clearer now, thanks!<br/>Looks very similar to how Psi-Run works, are you familiar with that system?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451619/#Comment_451619" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-24T14:36:51+00:00" title="February 24, 2016  2:36PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, never read or played Psi-Run: what are the similarities?
