Remember to include a piloting skill for the characters somewhere in the character sheet. For the mecha, let players come up with 6 sytems they want foir their mecha, among combat, movement, defense, stealth, etc. You can increase or decrease that amount for game balance, according to the mecha size. Discuss with them the limits appropiate for those systems for the setting you want. <br/><br/>I really don't care about distances or speed; either you reach your target or not. Also, if the battle is way too fast, tracking ammunition is cumbersome. Except for systems too powerful that can have a limited amount of uses per encounter or an ultimate attack that can be used only when the pilots have found out the weak point of his enemy or when their HP is too low.<br/><br/>Also, use the pilot's HP instead of assigning hp to the mecha, since the main characters fight until defeated or dead, and then their mecha stops functioning or blows up. Because yeah, "rules of japanese anime" state that characters receive actual damage when their mecha receives a hit, no matter how thick is the armor or how good are the impact suppressors of the mecha.<br/><br/>Now, when the mechas receive a hit, it doesn't only reduce the pilot's HP, it may also shut down one of its systems. (you can rule this when the damage is too high or on a critical roll) Roll randomly for the system that goes down, or make aimed attacks and shut down whatever system you have identified by observation or studying your sensors readouts from the enemy.<br/><br/>But of course, you can use your turn to redirect power from one system to another to bring it back online. Full success makes it functional again for the rest of the combat; partial success means it will only work for a couple of turns or a single attack; a failure means the system is totally fried and a fumble means both systems are now out of service.<br/><br/>A couple of things from Palladium's Robotech that actually help a lot too are:<br/>-Mega Damage. Means you can use the same weapon list from your game and state that mechas can use the oversized version of said equipment, except that damage is multiplied by 100 (or a million now that we're doing anime and that's what the Mega prefix actually means). Whenever the pilot is on the mecha, the pilot's HP is also multiplied by said amount, so it can withstand the damage. That means that common weaponry can't damage a mecha at all. Yeah, laugh all you want, in the practice it worked wonders for the game.<br/>-G-Maneuver. Dogfights can be simplified as a VS roll between two pilots using their piloting skill. Winner is behind the loser and gets all attacks. Except if the loser risks damaging the mecha to make a loop or a sudden full stop to get behind his enemy. Yeah, works better for actual planes instead of mecha that can twist in the air to redirect their weapons but you can outrule this for really high speed dog fights.<br/><br/>And I think that's it. From my experience hacking robotech, BESM, Tenra Bansho and a lot other mechanics that include anime-like mecha, you don't need too much else. Unless you're looking for another feeling for your game of course. But you don't need to believe me, go check all the other mecha games you can find. There is a few tons of stuff I'm leaving out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445100/#Comment_445100" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-05T18:24:54+00:00" title="May  5, 2015  6:24PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2015 6:25PM by CarpeGuitarrem.">edited May 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a>, I think that misses a huge part of the feel of TTGL, though I don't know if you've seen the show. Gurren Lagann is a show about vibrant, bombastic, macho ridiculous robots that somehow crystallizes into an anthem for the spirit of human passion and ambition. It's not about the robots, it's about the ever-increasing scale of the fights as a metaphor for the power of the human will. The series just keeps upping the stakes with bigger and bigger fights, to a ridiculous scope.<br/><br/>Though, Tenra wouldn't be the worst game to draw from, it's not a perfect fit but it does hit some stuff strongly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445101/#Comment_445101" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-05T20:41:24+00:00" title="May  5, 2015  8:41PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2015 8:48PM by WarriorMonk.">edited May 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That depends on what do you want the system to handle. My players <del>hate when the system imposes emotional stuff over their characters </del> well, more like just don't handle well and keep playing the system and pushing it's buttons to death instead of roleplaying, but they would be glad to provide that on their own with just a simple frame on how the mecha action is supposed to add unexpected twists to the story. (So it's more like I hate it when the system handles that part, though I may be glad to play games with such mechanics with a different group) <br/><br/>I'm looking now at the Capes flash tutorial and remembering how the aiki chits and emotional grid in Tenra could do the same, handle the emotional part of the conflict. But I've learn to accept that not all games suit all groups, so I've never used such mechanics again with my group and instead learned to have fun leaving them free to add that element into the fiction themselves.<br/><br/>Funny enough, my group usually handles that quite well, so for us game mechanics are all about the robots anyway, we just want something fast to handle them, to help emotions flow on their own uninterrupted by dice rolls, checking rules and keeping count of resources.<br/><br/>Also in our group, we have all watched and enjoyed TTGL, but also, we are old enough to remember more mecha shows that were way better without needing to scale out of the charts so much. I prefer even DieBuster to TTGL, FLCL to both of those, Gunbuster on top and I'd still have lots of fun more playing Mazinger Z.

None of them handle the specific combining aspect out of the box (I think Mecha has a supplement for it, but I haven't read it), but they all handle the hot-blooded "the pilot's fighting spirit is just as important as the robot" aspect well, which I think is probably the most important bit.<br/><br/>Mecha, like superheroes, is one of those genres that seems to result in much crunchier RPG rulesets than I care for.

However, like most role playing games, the game has a method of conflict resolution using dice. If the player succeeds, they earn a "franchise dice," and when enough are collected, the current case is solved. Players can, at any time, use confessionals, in the style of reality television, to add traits to other players' characters or steer events their way."<br/><br/>So, start your hack by making a checklist of cool tricks for the mecha. Use Tenra, Ctulhutech, BESM, the Gurren Lagan Wikia, whatever you want. Organize them in tiers according to power level. You can even enlist the players help with this, using a few index cards.<br/><br/>On InSpectres, players feed clues to the game; use the clues to create all sort of bizarre enemies, let players deal with them. Confessional scenes let them pick up higher tier tricks, while Franchise dice work like Spiral Force, allowing them to activate the tricks.<br/><br/>I'd need to read more about InSpectres to make it clearer but it looks to me like it may be exactly what you're looking for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445145/#Comment_445145" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-08T16:09:09+00:00" title="May  8, 2015  4:09PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Tenra Bansho Zero interested me sometime back (for just general anime inspiration) but IRRC I found myself a bit intimidated by what seemed to be a crunchy system tied heavily to the setting.</blockquote>\nIt's not really that bad;  I mean, it's complicated if you set it next to inSpectres, but not if you set it next to say, Cthulutech.<br/><br/>And while it is "tied to the setting" in that it generates the type of play that the setting is designed for, the setting is basically "All the anime!

Rules for combining. <br/></blockquote>\nI think number 4 is going to be tricky no matter what game you pick, like I said earlier, I can't think of many games that handle combining mecha, most of which I haven't read (that Mecha supplement, and I think Cartoon Action Hour has one too but I know nothing about that game) or wouldn't recommend for your purposes (Mekton).<br/><br/>As far as the other points go, I think Tenra Bansho is probably the closest thing I can think of.  It hits my personal sweet spot for 1, in that you can customize your ride a fair amount, but it's not anywhere near a Mekton or GURPS level of building from first principles, more like a slightly more detailed extension of picking your equipment.  An Armour (TBZ-ism for mecha) is very much an extension of the pilot, mechanically; the main benefit is that it basically works as an extra health track when the pilot is in it (you can choose which to assign damage to whenever you get hit, and there's some tactics involved since healing a person and fixing a mech are different procedures).  There's also a quality division between Armours, where top-of-the-line units are basically powered by the pilot's soul, which means they power up in accordance with the pilot's mental state (this ties into the very cool XP mechanics), but also runs the risk of killing the pilot if they lose control (this is more a "I don't care about the risk any more, this is worth it" thing than "save vs death, oops, go roll a new character").<br/><br/>Number 2 is also decently supported along two axes but may not cover number 3 to the degree you want; TBZ heavily relies on gaining and spending fate/luck points for short-term boosts to all kinds of things (bumping up stats, taking extra actions, interrupting other actions), but also pretty much every power gimmick (sword schools, ninjutsu, etc, almost all of which can be used in or out of cockpit) has ultimate techniques that can only be used if you've maxed out the appropriate skill, which can only be done after sufficiently dramatic character development (Tenra's XP and advancement rules basically require characters to choose causes or characters they're invested in, increase their devotion to, and ultimately abandon or change their perspective on, as a prerequisite for increasing stats or buying new skills.  It's very cool and battle-anime).<br/><br/>It's not a Gurren Lagann level of ridiculous power escalation, but frankly very few games can handle that without either breaking down under their own weight (most games), starting at that level and glossing over the mundane level (Nobilis), or just being so narrative and abstracted that the only real difference is the narration (FATE, Anima Prime).<br/><br/>On the other hand, Tenra's XP and advancement cycle also doubles as a sanity meter; gaining too much raw power too quickly (that is, without properly managing your character's emotional attachments) basically means they turn to the dark side of the force and become power-mad NPCs, which is VERY resonant with Gurren Lagann.  This is actually arguably a problem with Tenra; the game is tuned for short, dramatic games of 1-3 sessions, so power tends to escalate beyond comfort very quickly.  But hey, you might want that for this!<br/><br/>There is also a bit of a dark horse option depending on just how much hacking you're willing to do; I've always been very fond of the way HeroQuest handles numbers 2 and 3... in a nutshell, it keeps power escalation from being unwieldy by ranking people in degrees of "mastery"; every time your skill rating exceeds the actual dice cap, you drop it back down to minimum and add one to your mastery (so you end up with skills like, say, Swordplay 4m5, or 5 points and four masteries).  In combat and other opposed rolls, opposing masteries cancel each other out until only one side has any, and those excess masteries increase their owner's degree of success (so someone with 1 mastery who rolls a failure gets it bumped up to a success, and if they'd actually rolled well enough to succeed it becomes a critical success instead).  I really like the way that keeps clashes between super-powerful forces from exceeding the system's sweet spot while still emphasizing that a powered-up character can effortlessly defeat foes that may have been serious danger earlier in the campaign. <br/><br/>The current (second) edition of HQ is a generic system, so you'd have to cook up the mecha-genre-specific add-ons yourself, but it's not a terribly crunchy system.  On the other hand, HQ first edition, which is a non-generic fantasy game in the Glorantha setting, has an "advanced combat" subsystem the second edition omits, which more or less has characters wagering HPs back and forth during conflicts, which might lend itself to the combiner-mecha thing since there's support for teaming up to pool your HPs and/or give the active player bonuses on their roll.\n<blockquote><br/>As for a typical session, I'm thinking of possibly even setting scene framework - where the first half of the game will be outside of the mech, the second half will be a mech battle, capping off with some sort of new upgrade for at least one set of players each session. </blockquote>\nTenra is explicitly set up for this already!  It defaults to a scene-based framework, and has designated downtime moments during or after sessions for characters to make major character upgrades.  You should definitely look at Tenra-- it's probably my favorite game of the last five years (well, that or Monsterhearts, but that's definitely outside the bounds of this conversation).\n<blockquote><br/>It's not really that bad;  I mean, it's complicated if you set it next to inSpectres, but not if you set it next to say, Cthulutech.<br/><br/>And while it is "tied to the setting" in that it generates the type of play that the setting is designed for, the setting is basically "All the anime! All the Japan! Times 11!" - there's virtually nothing in the setting that the game will suffer for having removed.</blockquote>\nYeah, all true.  I think people get a little scared of Tenra because they see two books with like a thousand pages between them, but honestly the vast majority of the page count is taken up with setting details (as basically a worked example of what to do with the game) and can be ignored as much as you'd like.  I mean, Pathfinder is far too crunchy for my liking, and I love TBZ on both sides of the GM screen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445147/#Comment_445147" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-08T17:04:27+00:00" title="May  8, 2015  5:04PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            TBZ doesn't really handle continual power escalation, but it does have the Moment of Truth rule, where you can unload a bunch of aiki into character powerups instantaneously in a dramatic swoop.
