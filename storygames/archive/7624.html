Everything is going along swimingly, except for one thing: I'm having trouble figuring out when to got to the cards when a conflict arises. I also may be having trouble recognizing conflicts. Our group tends to roleplay everything out and they are fantastic and narrating in elements before we even get to any cards or conflicts. When I notice a situation that could blow-up in a fun way, or even has the possibility of any type of disagreement between characters, I'm quick to say: "HOLD ON! This is sounds like a conflict...what do your characters want out of the situation, etc". The problem is that I think my players are feeling sometimes that I'm just doing this because it's part of the rules and it halts the story. I've told them that conflicts are great because it's their chance to make things go their way with narration, and that conflicts will bring out unexpected moments in the story. They buy and mostly agree with all that, but I gotta say that it does sometimes feel like I'm shoehorning in the mechanics sometimes. After the first two sessions, I called for less conflicts than before, and the third episode went a little bit smoother. This isn't to say that I want to get rid of conflict mechanics altogether, but I'm just looking for any thoughts about running or even playing PTA when it comes to conflicts, setting stakes, and narration.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169267/#Comment_169267" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-15T17:53:07+00:00" title="September 15, 2008  5:53PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You go to the cards when there is an in-fiction conflict of interest between the characters.<br/><br/>It takes some practice recognizing social conflicts.  It shouldn't be an issue about persuasion or debate.  The key for me is to see if a weapon is being used and that includes social weapons.  If someone pulls rank or brings out a particularly painful emotion or memory.  That's an attack, that's a conflict.  It's the point at which someone is undermining the other person's freewill in favor of manipulation.<br/><br/>Then remember that the High Card player has full rights to spin the consequences of the outcome however he likes.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169271/#Comment_169271" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-15T18:25:27+00:00" title="September 15, 2008  6:25PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse is right, and (perhaps unfortunately, perhaps not) it's not an exact science.

SGBoston uses PtA as our go-to game, and we rarely set up shows that involve players going against each other. If you're playing Law and Order, Briscoe and Green yell at each other or get tense with each other occasionally, but that's the exception to the rule. You can still do shows like that just fine, in my experience, with plenty of good conflict and tension.<br/><br/>Here's some other things I look for:<br/><br/>-- Can I hammer on the star of the episode's issue?<br/>-- If I was watching this show, would I know what comes next? Could I be thrown for a loop?<br/>-- What will different kinds of success mean for this character's role in the show?<br/><br/>Overall, I've learned to really take the premise that this is a show to heart. I spend budget with a close eye towards the act structure and towards what makes sense on TV, and I pay quite a bit less attention to "attacks" and "weapons." Jesse's approach sounds a bit alien to me, which just goes to highlight JD's point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169283/#Comment_169283" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-15T19:09:56+00:00" title="September 15, 2008  7:09PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The text of PrimeTime Adventures states that if no-one else has called for a conflict and a conflict is "glaringly obvious", it is the producers responsibility to call for the conflict. In general, yeah, the table needs to work out that the conflict is shaping up and call for the mechanics to be engaged as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Remember that PTA conflicts only need involve one actual protagonist (although they can involve more). "Conflicts" involving protagonists struggling against supporting characters, hordes of nameless thugs. biting winds or their own alcoholism are all kosher in PTA. All conflicts are played "against" the Producer, after all. (If protagonists are directly opposed, you compare their cards against the producers first, and THEN each other if they've both beaten the producer. But it's often a better idea to set orthogonal stakes, even if that seems contradictory at first.)<br/><br/>The best conflict advice for PTA is right there in the text, which is to ensure that the protagonists stakes are related to their issues. Conflict for the sake of conflict will be dull, but conflicts that relate to the broader narrative arc of the character are much more interesting.<br/><br/>Remember also to set stakes such that both getting the stakes and not getting them are interesting and dramatic outcomes, appropriate to the nature of the TV series you're making.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169284/#Comment_169284" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-15T19:10:41+00:00" title="September 15, 2008  7:10PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric</cite><br/>That's certainly one time to do it, but I've run a lot of PtA games where there was precious little in-fiction conflict of interest between (player) characters.<br/><br/>Jesse's approach sounds a bit alien to me, which just goes to highlight JD's point.</blockquote>\nTo be clear, I was talking about ANY fictional characters.

This usually happens after somebody throws down a gauntlet of some sort.  However, some groups (and this might include yours, Jesse), have their give-and-take social structure so well-defined that they know how to roll with a thrown-down gauntlet and keep blazing away.  My advice: <em>let them</em>.  As Meserach points out, the Producer only needs to call conflict when it's glaringly obvious (like when the PCs, in the heat of discussion, resort to repeating their basic argument).  If the PCs don't want to go to cards, don't make them unless they're clearly butting their heads and not moving forward.  PTA is nice like that \u2014 it works for new groups and finely-tuned groups with a long history.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169295/#Comment_169295" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-15T20:02:48+00:00" title="September 15, 2008  8:02PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is this a case where the group "agrees" to try a new game, but then they want play to be familiar and not rock their boats at all?

Sometimes, it can suck the life out of the roleplaying to call a conflict too early. Like, we're just getting into a stand-up argument, and someone goes "That's a conflict!" and we go "Yes, we know, but let us carry on for a moment first".<br/><br/>2. Having said that, sometimes a conflict can be talked through if it's called too late. We're having an argument, and I bully the guy into submission, and someone goes "That's a conflict!", and the conflict falls flat because it was all resolved anyway. (I've seen this second one <i>particularly</i> among new players).<br/><br/>So, yeah, timing.

Don't be afriad to lay out the conflict, and if you need to back off a bit to let the players roleplay a bit to add color or change the direction slightly or even completely.  All of that's fine as long as you still end up with conflict.  Setting conflicts early will let the players get used to the rules as well as the rhythm and purpose of conflicts.

And I am not talking about the usual "play group style", I am talking about very different games, with different procedures. The game text leave a lot of things unspecified, so by filling these blank parts with their assumptions (and with a very minor drift if necessary) people play very different versions of PTA, but with everybody thinking that they play it "the right way"<br/><br/>(this happened with the initials D&amp;D, too: maybe this multi-faced propriety is something that help a game succeed...)<br/><br/>There is people who play-act the producer and the actors deciding the next direction of the show (and they even play-act the pitch phase), and other people who use the TV metaphor only as a metaphor and never, ever tread the characters as unreal. There is people who first decide the conflict, then play the scene, and people who play a scene, and if there is no conflict, it's OK.<br/><br/>So, the point when you should go to the cards depends very much from the kind of PTA game you play.<br/><br/>Maybe it would be better to call them specific names. The way Ron describe in the first thread I linked could be called "passionate-PTA", seeing that it seems to be to be based on the principles Jess talk about in his site "Play Passionately". The one played with the story-conference before and after scene would be, I don't know, "story-conferencing-PTA", and so on.<br/><br/>Because I am really tired of seeing in these threads a lot of people coming to tell everybody "how real PTA is played"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169557/#Comment_169557" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-16T22:38:00+00:00" title="September 16, 2008 10:38PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jessecoombs</cite>Now to spin it a little, what are your conflicts about?

The conflicts always resolve some action or event, giving resolution to the scene. But the particular stakes are usually implicitly, if not explicitly, framed to involve a character's issue - at least, if it's a character scene.

Also, only set stakes for things where both resolutions (getting the stakes, not getting them) is a good way for the story to go forward.<br/><br/>For example, bad stakes: "Does Buffy survive the attack by the group of mook vampires?" Obviously no-one around the table wants to see Buffy die to these mook vampires. If Buffy is to die, it should be a conflict about something more meaningful than that, and probably related to her Issue. Moreover, Buffy dying brings this episode to a crashing halt (unless it's the climax, in which case, why is she fighting mooks?)<br/><br/>Better, but still bad stakes: "Does Buffy defeat the mook vampires?" Why? Because anyone watching the show realises the answer should be yes. Seeing Buffy fail to defeat these weak vampires kinda defeats the point of her being a vampire slayer. Even worse, suceedign at the conflict tells us nothing that we didn't know already. Buffy klilled some vampires. Yay.<br/><br/>Better stakes ideas that still involve a big vampire fight scene:<br/><br/>"Does Buffy show compassion for the repentant vampire during the fight?" Follow-up: "Does she kill him anyway?"<br/>"Is Buffy reckless during the fight?" Follow-up: "Does she injure herself because of it?" or "Does Dawn get put in danger because of it?"<br/>"Does Xander show bravery during the fight?" Follow-up: "Does it matter?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169703/#Comment_169703" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-17T14:36:31+00:00" title="September 17, 2008  2:36PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Wilson</cite><br/>There have been a few threads recently about problematic Primetime Adventures games where people aren't doing what the rules tell them to do.

I don't know exactly what questions I should be asking to figure out how a conflict hsould work, because I don't know what I'm missing, so I need the detailed descriptive examples.</blockquote>\nIn my play, I've observed three basic types of scenes.<br/><br/>The first kind of scene I'm going to call "Curiosity" scene.  Basically there's some set of characters or some set of circumstances that we haven't seen a while and someone gets curious about what they might be up to.  Something like, "I have no idea what James's relationship with his mother is like, so I'm going to frame a scene with James and his mother."  Socially we have no idea what the conflict is or even if there WILL be a conflict.  Often there isn't.  It's just a scene that establishes some things about a relationship or situation.<br/><br/>The second kind of scene I'm going to call a Tension scenes.  Similar to curiosity scenes these scenes start with someone want to see some kind of interaction, however, it's usually obvious (socially) upfront that that interaction is going to be tense.  James found out earlier that John was sleeping with his wife.  Now someone wants to know what happens when James and John next meet.  We still don't know if there will be a conflict but the LIKELYhood of a conflict is pretty palpable among the group and indeed people will usually start angling their characters purposefully towards a conflict.<br/><br/>The third kind of scene generally happens near the end of an episode or around a major turning point.  I'll call these scenes Confrontation scenes.  Basically we know up front that conflict is going to happen pretty much because something in the fiction told us it was going to happen.  Like James and John agree to a duel.  Finally someone says, "Okay, I think it's time to play out the duel."  We pretty much know (socially) going into the scene that there's going to be a conflict and what it's going to look like.<br/><br/>I don't really recommend formalizing these things in anyway during play.  These are just the three general social "vibes" at the top of a scene I've observed.  I find PtA becomes problematic when someone starts a Curiosity scene and the participants feel pressure to "find the conflict."  Don't.  Just play until the situation at hand feels completed and move on.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169710/#Comment_169710" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-17T15:02:06+00:00" title="September 17, 2008  3:02PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Often there isn't.

The worst was conflicts called too soon: nearly all of the fun roleplaying and back-and-forth interaction that our players adore simply vanished the instant we went to the cards, and none of the players really felt like getting to narrate the resolution was an adequate compensation for losing that.  If you can't get the timing down, I'd suggest at the very least erring on the "call the conflict too late" side, because a conflict resolved via roleplaying at least provides <i>some</i> entertainment, while a conflict called too soon rewards no one.<br/><br/>* Purely physical conflicts suck ass.  There wasn't enough "crunch" to the rules to make resolving something like a car chase or a fistfight or action scenes in general satisfying in their own right (and for action-movie junkies like our players, that was a problem).  Narrating action scenes turns off most of our group, too, which was another reason why it didn't work for us.  Conflicts worked better for us when they boiled down to choices -- shoot through the hostage and kill the bad guy because your anger demands it, or hold off on the shot and let the bad guy escape because your sense of justice requires it -- and we just started to steer clear of fight scenes and cool stunts, since we couldn't get the same charge out of 'em in PTA that we were getting in other games.  Conflicts based on interesting choices always worked for us.  If you're doing an action-scene-based show, keep well away from making the action scene the conflict; do whatever else you want to do to make the action scene fun for everyone, but save the cards for a "key moment" in the fight where one decision will dramatically change the final outcome.<br/><br/>* Fuck "winning" narration rights.  No, seriously, fuck it right in the ear the instant that it stops working for your group.  If passing narration rights around is fucking up the coherence of the story (a real problem in our group), or is annoying a player who doesn't like narrating (again, a problem in our group), or is in any way just not making your game hum, try something else.  Do a mini-pitch session and have the Producer do the narration afterwards, or let a player bribe the Producer with a budget token to "steal" narration, or give it to whoever asks for it, anything other than slavishly following the "highest card narrates" rule even when it isn't working for you.  Jesus, I wish we'd gone this direction sooner; I doubt it would've gotten us to stick with PTA, but at least it might have made a few of our sessions more fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169733/#Comment_169733" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-17T17:39:24+00:00" title="September 17, 2008  5:39PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2008 5:57PM by Jesse.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the things people need to practice in PtA with the whole "High Card" thing is spinning consequences onto outcomes in the case of BOTH success and failure.  That's how you give things like "action sequences" weight.<br/><br/>Go ahead and set the Stakes at something like, "Do we catch them?" and then let the High Card player explain the *consequences* of that.  For example: Consider a chase sequence in a cop show.  Stakes are: Do we catch them?  Deal cards!  Success!  High Card player: You speed through the streets, cars spin, news helicopters fly over head, a civilian car is flipped!  Cut to the: Mayor coming down hard on the police commissioner, "Is this how you're training your men these days!  The PD recklessly endangering the public is all over the 8 'o clock news.  The rest of this investigation better go by the book!"<br/><br/>See?  I consider stakes like: "Do we catch them by being wreckless or not?" kind of boring because there's nothing for the High Card player to do.  It mixes Consequences in with the Stakes.  Stakes are Character Goals.  High Card player determines consequences for achieving/failing to achieve those goals.<br/><br/>Edited Note: I lied!  The Stakes might very well be, "Am I reckless?"  But in that case don't pre-agree on whether or not you catch the guy.  High Card player gets to decide after he sees whether you were reckless or not.<br/><br/>P.S. When I run I never allow the High Card to introduce or alter back story.  For example if we're doing an interrogation scene.  Stakes are about whether or not the character has to proceed with our without new knowledge.  On Success The Producer introduces new knowledge.  The High Card player says whether you had to resort to torture or not, or had to bribe the guy or agree to an unseemly favor.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169741/#Comment_169741" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-17T18:54:25+00:00" title="September 17, 2008  6:54PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Jesse, <br/><br/>Knowing that you "REALLY dislike the 'resolving internal states' method of PtA," how does "Am I reckless?" not get your back up?

It's not "do I turn my brother in or not?"  It's a pretty sizable state of affairs that doesn't hinge on one thing.<br/><br/>It isn't my FAVORITE Stake in the world but it's an important grey zone that I could see being at the forefront of the character's mind.  "Oh man, if I fuck this up the boss is going to have my ass!"  If anything I see "Am I reckless" as really more of a conflict between the character and his (possibly not present) superior.  The Stake might be better worded as: "I don't want to appear reckless in the eyes of my superior."  With the High Card player ultimately deciding what failure means, narrating everything from the character actually being pretty damn reckless to the superior simply nit-picking on an in the moment impassioned deviation from protocol.  Hell, on success the High Card player might narrate the character being pretty damn reckless but the superior so impressed with the results he doesn't care.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169744/#Comment_169744" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-17T19:17:22+00:00" title="September 17, 2008  7:17PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Do I turn my brother in or not?" is <b>terrible</b>.

(Our players <i>adore</i> interrogation scenes, but we stopped even attempting them in PTA because even when the cards didn't come out too soon and ruin the fun conversation part of the scene, the guy with the highest card was usually left saying to the Producer "Hey, if I wanted to just make up the information anyway, I wouldn't have bothered with the interrogation.")                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169750/#Comment_169750" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-17T19:56:55+00:00" title="September 17, 2008  7:56PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            About mental states, I would consider the conscious decisions of a character ("I will save my brother or my wife?") off-limits to stakes, but I would allow (depending on the particular circumstances) stakes about the things not fully under the conscious mind control  (force of will, reflexes, mental fortitude, self-control, intuition, deduction capacity, etc.).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169751/#Comment_169751" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-17T19:59:34+00:00" title="September 17, 2008  7:59PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, internal state conflicts can be about:<br/>- Emotions ("I will not be afraid!" "Oh yeah? We'll see...")<br/>- Self-control ("I don't need a drink to function.")<br/>- Mystical/Spiritual ("It's okay, I have faith...")<br/><br/>In all of those cases, the cards tell us whether or not the character gets what they want. They want to feel good about beating someone up. They want to not obsess about the bottle in their desk drawer. They want to not care about Billy's new girlfriend. They want their faith to be strong and comforting.<br/><br/>The cards never, ever make a decision for the character. The cards say, "Yep, you're still terrified of the old bastard." The player decides what the character does as a result of being terrified, possibly as table-talk during narration. The high-card narrator gets some authority right then, too, to say something like, "Mitch is so scared, he's trembling. The gun goes off in his hand."<br/><br/>Contrast that to  this conflict: "I take out my pistol and kill him." You lose, and the Narrator can say, "You're too afraid of the old bastard to even draw your gun. He smiles his horrible little smile." That's fine, too. Internal-states are fair game for narration to show why and how a conflict turns out the way it does.<br/><br/>Does that shed any light?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169766/#Comment_169766" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-17T21:55:32+00:00" title="September 17, 2008  9:55PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite><cite>Posted By: demiurgeastaroth</cite><br/>The main issue for me is related to this thread: how to decide when to call a conflict, and what a conflict actually is.<br/><br/>I have seen a lot of threads by PTA enthusiasts, but they never ever give concrete and detailed examples of what their conflicts would look like to an observer (inlcuding all the interactions of the players during the build up to and resolution of the conflict).

I don't want to use it really. It doesn't mean anything useful to play. Plot this plot that blah blah. Plot's just things that happen.<br/><br/>What matters to a story is tension. You have scenes where you build tension or you have scenes where the tension is resolved.<br/><br/>In that regard, you have the opportunity -- not a necessity, but an opportunity -- to throw cards in any scene. Cards aren't just to resolve tension. They're to jack it up. Your issue gets in the way. You say something stupid. That builds tension between your guy and mine. You can think of the cards, then, as constraints to how you resolve the scene, rather than how you resolve a conflict. <br/><br/>Because sometimes scenes are really cool if there's stuff that ain't resolved between you and me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169841/#Comment_169841" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-18T09:14:23+00:00" title="September 18, 2008  9:14AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Throwing the cards is fun.

They are happily playing along, contributing to the fiction, roleplaying it and changing until suddenly -BAM- the game stops dead in its tracks as they turn towards the rules, follow them blindly and expect the fiction to somehow have been enhanced or brilliantly developed through the inscrutable magic that is a random dice throw or card play. <br/><br/>I can understand the appeal of wanting the rules to do the "hard work" of making the fiction interesting and engaging for you, but I think that's an illusion. The right pacing, getting emotional investment into the conflicts, making the consequences count and building towards a climactic final scene... this is all the group's work. (Largely because they are the only ones who can know what to add to the fiction to make it *click* for them. There are no objective rules for stories that blow you away.) <br/><br/>I guess this is just my long-winded way of saying that to me there is no objectively right time to go the cards. Or rather, I've learned not to look at the fiction to figure out when to invoke the rules. Instead of waiting for X to happen, so I can go to rule Y; I look for when the momentum at the table is just about to turn, and then use the cards to make the fiction as unpredictable and exciting as good TV is. Tension is a brilliant way to put it. Nowadays I try to rack it up as far as we're comfortable with in the scene, before calling for the cards. Sometimes this means a scene ends with a mean glare, sometimes it ends with a big threat looming on the horizon. Once the players have said their piece (and I try to make sure they do not say more than that... like plotting out endless possibilities and consequences), the cards can come out. <br/><br/>Inner conflict, outer conflict, big threat, no threat... it doesn't matter. Unless I really care about not knowing what happens next, the cards stay where they are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
