Here's my original (decided un-gonzo) play report:<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Robbins</cite>Microscope, alt-history Elizabethan era. The second Spanish Armada conquers Britannia but the<i>Gloriana Invicta</i>resistance ("Elizabeth unvanquished") continues the fight for queen and country.<br/><br/>We've already seen that the British heir-in-hiding Prince James was secretly part of the conspiracy that murdered his own younger sister, Princess Matilde, even while keeping up appearances as her loving brother and protector. Jerk! We go back to before she was killed to answer the seemingly simple question "how was she murdered?" The scene is the conspirators plotting to get rid of the princess. It's set in the gardens of a noble who has secretly supports the resistance and has been hiding the prince and princess from the occupying Spaniards.<br/><br/>Folks are picking characters. It's the usual choices: the prince, the noble, the cutthroat who is biding his time as the princess's bodyguard but is really waiting for the order to kill her.<br/><br/>Hmm, this scene seems too easy. So I pick the princess. The scene framer didn't think to ban her. Go ahead and do your plotting right in front of the poor girl you heartless bastards! Kind-hearted Princess Matilde spends the scene strolling through the garden innocently plucking flowers and bringing them to her loving brother and future assassin. Each time she's out of ear-shot the prince and their two-faced host discuss how best to murder her.<br/><br/>And then to really put the icing on the cake-of-pain, we have the princess's protector and secret love-that-cannot-be (and devoted agent of the resistance) wander into the scene and watch unwittingly as she is handed the poison that will kill her. Which isn't so bad, because we already played the scene years later where he uncovers his masters' treachery and exacts brutal revenge with his own hand. Seeing how callous her murder is actually explains why he was/will be so ruthless in the earlier/future scene.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377693/#Comment_377693" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-11T01:56:55+00:00" title="May 11, 2012  1:56AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When we played Penny for My Thoughts, the game included a memory of Paul Tevis smuggling D20s up his arse across the border into Mexico where gaming was illegal.

And when one person pushes beyond what you expect would be a boundary, maybe you go a little further to see what happens. That this behavior results in really silly and often genuinely fun situations amplifies the effect. I know people who play GMless games exclusively in this mode - they like it crazy and ridiculous and play to see how ridiculous they can make it. I think it is more common to do this for a session or two and then look for other ways to play. <br/><br/>With Microscope this lack of procedural or social boundaries seems to result in gigantic sprawling space operas or epic LOTR-style fantasy kingdoms, often with somewhat incoherent details ("and the whale-warriors ... have unicorn riders!"). I commented to Ben how cool it was to see a more subtle alternate history example that really drilled down to the personal. This struck me as the equivalent of a Fiasco session that was drenched in melancholy and focused on the dissolution of a marriage, without a radioactive owl in sight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377702/#Comment_377702" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-11T03:38:28+00:00" title="May 11, 2012  3:38AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We have this "problem" every time with InSpectres.

So I agree that it's the lack of boundaries (or constraints as I like to call them in my theory of good gaming) which results in gonzo. In writing a story you would naturally limit yourself to one, perhaps two breaches of narrative or contextual constraints. In Mortal Coil, the theme document prevents this kind of madness taking place (in my experience) by forcing the players to create their own constraints.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377704/#Comment_377704" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-11T03:48:15+00:00" title="May 11, 2012  3:48AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Isn't this effect common in amateur improv as well, suggesting that getting more serious, coherent material is a learned skill and so without a referee everyone now needs it (rather than just one person)?

If you've nailed down specific creative aesthetics (seriousness, lightness, ambiguity, etc.) for the game first then it becomes much easier to avoid things that don't fit those aesthetics. Of course, during play context and hence aesthetics can change - so the really interesting question to me is how we signal group aesthetics which are acceptable even when we don't intend to buy into them. <br/><br/>Less technically, how do we let ourselves laugh at a gonzo idea (a natural reaction), and still discourage it when we don't want to accept things getting more gonzo?<br/><br/>  - Mendel<br/><br/>*Not a choice of G/N/S, but actually the group agenda on how you want to be creative.

So: "Let's play this as though it were a sequel to No Country For Old Men, and keep it menacing and desert-baked and low profile."<br/><br/>If everyone is on board, you can sort of facilitate by modeling "appropriate" creative input and flagging it when someone diverges. This is basically what a GM does, I think.

These days, it happens very rarely. And the problem isn't so much a matter of GMed or GMless. I mean, what are the problems we're really talking about here?<br/><br/>People introducing humor to a degree that's no longer fun or inappropriate.<br/>People exercising creative control in a way that doesn't read the desired tone of the rest of the people at the table.<br/><br/>This can happen in GMed games. Simon says in the 4th post that he has this problem with InSpectres, a game with a GM. This could (and I'm sure does) happen at games of good old fashioned D&amp;D. Imagine you're running Death Frost Doom, a very atmospheric, moody, and dark module, and a player is running their PC as an over the top, kender-ish clown character who softshoes from room to room, destroying the mood and making everyone at the table miserable. It's the same thing and I have seen it happen.<br/><br/>I avoid this stuff by doing a couple of things:<br/><br/>- I learned pretty early on that there needs to be a firm framework that the players can work with. If you sit down and say, "Let's come up with any story we waaant" the game is going to get gonzo fast. That's what happened to my earliest con games of Capes where I sat down, said, "superheroes" and then just went to town. We had narratives with no sense, characters all over the place, and just a total zoo. Like Jason says, this gets old fast, so I started restricting the game down. I came down with a clear pitch. I made my "Greater of Two Evils" game and said, "Okay, all the superheroes are dead. Galactus is attacking. We're all supervillains who have to team up to stop him. We open up with a meeting of supervillains in an orbital space station." Games were immediately way, way, way more successful from the standpoint of having a coherent story and not running rampant with gonzo humor. There was still humor, but it was natural to the source material.<br/><br/>- Don't worry about whether you're GMing or not. John says, "It's not hard for me to GM in a GMless game and moderate gonzo. But then it feels weird to me that the solution to my issues with GMless games is to GM." I used to worry about this too. But think of GMless games more this way. It's creating this void at the table of responsibilities and roles that were previously filled by the GM. What GMless games do is provide you with that space, and then it is your job as a player of that game to expand to fill it as much as you need or want to. In a convention game, where people are not familiar with the rules or perhaps wary about what they can and can't contribute, it is a feature of GMless play that you can expand to help guide them and guide play, or draw back and let enthusiastic or knowledgeable players contribute more. I've run The Final Girl at a bunch of conventions over the course of years, and this last year I had a bunch of players who had attended previous games show up. It was really gratifying to pretty much just sit back and let them take the wheels.<br/><br/>- "I don't know, man," or "Come on, guys," are my Archipelago-esque magic phrases when things start go off the road at a convention. Just because it's GMless does not mean if the game starts going in a direction you are not happy with or not comfortable with you can't speak up. You don't have the Iron Crown of GMing resting on your brow to back you up, but it's totally cool to do this. I usually find that nicely and imploringly asking for someone to find a different way in any GMless game does the trick. I'm actually more comfortable in GMless games than GMed games for this reason. If the GM runs a game I hate, I don't feel comfortable asking him to change what he's doing!<br/><br/>So really, the only situations I've been in where shit goes bad anymore is where I literally cannot address the behavior of a player at the table, and I realized this has nothing to do with whether the game is GMed or GMless. The two worst GMless games I've been at were at one game where a player introduced some extremely uncomfortable sexual stuff into a scene, and another where the player was not paying any attention to the cues of everyone else at the table (this was my infamous Castlevania game where the other players made the dishonored knight and the Belmont inn owner, and he made Samus Aran). In the former game the guy was a bit of a weird dude but when we went "WHOA NO" he stopped. The latter case, I said, "I don't really think that fits with the rest of the characters" and he ignored me and kept doing what he wanted. Both were not issues with a lack of a GM, they were both issues with problematic individuals at the table.<br/><br/>So John, stop being a wimp and play a GMless game with me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377761/#Comment_377761" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-11T08:05:23+00:00" title="May 11, 2012  8:05AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Bret">@Bret</a> InSpectres the problem is that the GM role does not have authority over this issue  - so it's effectively GMless.

The GM is responsible for introducing the plot (especially initially, but they do have to adapt to what the players do), portraying NPCs, describing the results of player failure. There are only two circumstances where the players have greater narrative control: when their character succeeds, and when they use a confessional. The rest of the time, the GM is responsible for the same things that any GM is responsible for in any other game, so while I think player authority encroaches on areas that are off limits in other games it definitely can't be described as effectively GMless.<br/><br/>And sure, there are lots of solutions to encoding this stuff into games. If you want to look at a GMless game that has it all encoded, Polaris defines the premise and scope of the game, narrative authority, and who can say what and when in a way that still leaves the fiction as shared stuff that theoretically everyone has authority over. The Bully Pulpit games don't go quite that far, but Fiasco gives you a basic gist based on playset selection. The pregame part where you're assembling the elements serves to get you on semi-solid footing when the game begins, but is still a bit open and so, I think, goes gonzo unless someone steps up and goes "Hey guys let's tone it down." Which, from what I understand, is how Jason intended it. The Final Girl deals with this by having a more narrow scope - the game revolves around a slasher, the victims, and who lives and who dies. While it's possible to go gonzo, the fact that most people can hook into horror movie tropes and conventions keeps it from straying too far.<br/><br/>So I mean, are you looking for solutions that haven't been done already? Or are you looking for examples? Because yes, I can think of a lot of ways that this is encoded into the rules to varying degrees of strictness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377771/#Comment_377771" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-11T08:31:09+00:00" title="May 11, 2012  8:31AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite><br/>So I mean, are you looking for solutions that haven't been done already?
