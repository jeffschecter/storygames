                            I just had a look through the table of contents, and I'm curious... is there anything unique in here?<br/>
<br/>
I ask not because I'm saying it's bad not to be unique... certainly, people have had a lot of fun with games that were just mishmashes of things that were done before... but what perks up my interest about a game is what it brings to the world of RPG's that's new and different.                        </div>

                            Hi!  At a glance, I would put the character creation rules *before* the lists of skills and spells, combat rules, and maybe even races.  When I look at a game, I want to know a) what the setting elements are, and then b) how to make a character for that game.  Also, after you've read through everything, it's handy not to have the character creation rules buried somewhere after lists and lists of things.  I'd like to know who my character is, what they can do, and how they do it, in that order.  Maybe define what a skill, talent, etc. is in the chargen section, but put the list afterwards.  But that's just how I think.  :)  I like how you use "talent" rather than something more bland and less descriptive.  Also, perhaps as an additional table of contents, list where the most-referenced tables are to save in-game time.<br/>

                            Hey Dave, <br/><br/>I like that you spend some time addressing interpersonal issues at the table.   I don't agree with all your advice, but that's OK.  On page 221 you say:  <br/><br/>"You should realize that the goal of any roleplaying game is to have fun and that the secondary goal is to tell a cool story. The more each player (including the Judge) can add to the story narrative, the more engaging and fun that story can become. So, if you can describe your characterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actions with a little narrative flair, you are adding to the game in a real and meaningful way.  You can get a bonus to the difficulty level through the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s estimation of the quality of your<br/>narration"<br/><br/>How do you see this happening in play?  You state that it will be a consensus decision to award a bonus, but this immediately raises a lot of red flags for me.  Power dynamics, popularity contests (a lot of the stuff mulled over in the "dickery" thread) could be brought to bear to make this rule problematic.  Also, the narrative bar in your example is set pretty low - do you expect bonuses to every roll, and if so, what about handling time?                        </div>

                            Hi!<br/>
Vax:<br/>
"is there anything unique in here?"<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Talents. A Talent is an ability custom made by the player during character creation. In order to finish your character, you have to answer, what's makes your character special?<br/>
<br/>
Nancy:<br/>
"I would put the character creation rules *before* the lists of skills etc."<br/>
  I dunno, It's in that order on purpose. I am trying to put the character generation rules in "perspective." So that when you fill in the stats and answer questions about your character, you know what you are committing to. Maybe I am just being arrogant in thinking that my setting is obtuse enough that it takes some reading to understand, lol<br/>
  So far, during play, there does not seem to be "most referenced tables," but I will bare that in mind mobving forward.<br/>
<br/>
Jason:<br/>
  I am worried about judging narration bonuses too. In a good group it is a limp rule with not a lot of teeth. 2 difficulty boost is not "over the top" and might not be enough incentive to get players to put the extra effort.<br/>
  In a bad group it could become tools of favoritism and manipulation. I haven't had a player really try and use this in game yet. It's sort of low on my list of priorities, so I haven't pushed players to try it out yet...<br/>
  Although I think timing is not that bad, except in the worst group possible. The bar is set so low that it would not "require" okayers to yammer on and on just to get 2 difficulty shift...<br/>
<br/>
  Wow! Thanks guys for taking the time. Any and all criticism is welcome. I have almost no experience with narrativism and any insight from "that" perspective would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
  What does anyone else have to add?<br/>

                            Hi Dave,  I can definitely understand where you're coming from, wanting folks to understand what the setting is about.  I just feel daunted when faced with lists of things that I'm somehow supposed to remember.  I think it's how I create characters: I figure out what I want them to be and then assign them skills and what have you based on that, so I really don't want to or need to read all those lists.  If they're before the character creation stuff, I'll feel compelled to read them (which is your point.  :P), but there's a strong possibility I'd be scared away by them if I'm just picking up the book for a glance, which is why I made the suggestion.<br/>

<p>Dave, regarding the issue Jason brought up:</p>
<p>Looking at the games that use 'bonuses for decription' rules, I find that the most effective of these games provide very specific directions for applying those bonuses.</p>
<p>Exalted has one of these that is unfortunately throttled by resource and timing effects; it boils down to, "You can get extra dice by describing why you care about this." So you can be like, "Oh no! That girl is drowning! I remember once I was drowning and the way I felt when a stranger saved me..." and based on that add your Compassion to a roll for saving that girl.</p>
<p>So, as a result this biases players to make characters that care about things.</p>
<p>This still has a strong interpretive aspect, but, importantly, it tells the players <em>what kind of input you want.</em></p>

  Thanks Nancy, I'll bear that in mind.<br/>
<br/>
  Semp, yeah, as soon as I get a handle on PDF editing, I will definitely work to make it more user-friendly. Right now I am working in Word and converting it via lulu.com<br/>
<br/>
Shrey, I have played Exalted before and was going more for Stunt Bonuses than Virtue Dice. Here's the rest of the rule that Jason pasted:<br/>
<br/>
Quote<br/>
"Narrative Difficulty Modifier Table<br/>
Quality----Difficulty Modifier--Example<br/>
Normal---------- +0---------I attack him with my sword<br/>
Descriptive------ -1----------My character lunges at their foe with his rapier<br/>
Narrative-------- -2----------Ã¢â‚¬Å“I shall avenge my comrades!Ã¢â‚¬Â Fredrick shouts as he fiercely wields his rapier and aims for the villainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heart<br/>
<br/>
Note: Lower Difficulties are better<br/>
<br/>
  Bear in mind that a descriptive or narrative explanation of what your character is doing does not have to be original or flowery. It can be a creative re-wording of a line form a movie, book or any source. As long as it is descriptive, in genre and in character, it will add to the story being told."<br/>
End Quote<br/>
<br/>
  The Difficulty number range from 3 to 27, so 1 or 2 is not worth breaking your back over, but it might be enough to get casual players to emote, lol<br/>
<br/>
  Any other comments, ideas, suggestions. This is great feedback, you guys really do rock!<br/>

                            Hey Dave, <br/><br/>I like to assume a good group, since a bad group is usually self-correcting (turning into either a good group or no group).  If you go on that assumption your narration bonus, as written, isn't a good rule.<br/><br/>Overall the feeling I got in your "how to GM" section was defensive, as though you were anticipating problem players and prepping your Judge for confronting them.  You might consider assuming players are all kinds of awesome and try to point out the pitfalls in your rules that can make them occasionally stumble - maybe the difference is just semantic, but it's a more positive approach for sure!                        </div>

<p>This is why I suggest a more strongly manipulative rule, and why I used Virtue channelling as an example rather than stunts.</p>
<p>"You get cookies for having fun" is vacuous. They're having fun! What do they need cookies for? In Exalted, you have to <em>assume</em> that every character stunts <em>every turn</em> when calibrating Charms for Essence economy. It's not a reward, just a fact of life.</p>
<p>Whereas, by rewarding specific, narrow things that you want, you can expect players to reach for these things when they need a mechanical boost, not all the time but enough to make a difference.</p>
<p><em>Edit:</em> It also matters that the bonus have some respectabe magnitude, such that players know they can rely on it at need, or it will simply be ignored.</p>

                            Wait, so in D&amp;D, there shouldn't be XP rewards for doing killing monsters, because the players already want to kill the monsters? Am I reading too much into what you (Jason and Shreyas) are saying?                        </div>

                            I don't know D&amp;D at all, Adam.  Are you more likely to get XP if you describe your attack well?  Because that's what I'm objecting to here.  I'm not anti-XP, if that's what you're suggesting - I'm playing in a TSOY game right now and I'm an XP hawg!                        </div>

                            Hi!<br/>
  I think Adam is trying to say that not rewarding players for having fun is analgous to not giving players XPs for doing what the game is about?<br/>
<br/>
  But to get us back on track, how could you encourage a Casual Gamer to use a little more narative licens in their descriptions of actions in a Task Resolution oriented game?                        </div>

                            I don't mean that, Adam, although I can see where the notion came from.  <br/><br/>Dave, take a look at <a href="http://www.anvilwerks.com/src/tsoy2/book1--rulebook.txt" rel="nofollow">The Shadow of Yesterday</a>, which lets you pick the totally boss things you want to do and then rewards you for doing them.                        </div>
