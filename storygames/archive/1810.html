                    ... to hang themselves, of course.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not talking about tricking people.  I'm talking about the blessed situation where you have players who <b>want</b> to help create their own adversity ... who want to get their characters into trouble and hardship.  These players, given a choice between doing something the easy, pain-free way and doing it the horrible, scarring way will see that as a great opportunity, and sieze the bloody path with wild abandon.  They want, in short, to help frame the challenges that they will later face.  I like those players.<br/>
<br/>
When I'm GMing, and I have such players, I try to change how I deal with them.  Forcing particular challenges on them is just not taking full advantage of the resources at the table.  Yes, they'll rise to the challenges I place before them, but then they're not getting the chance to make their own challenges.<br/>
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText"><b>Example to ground conversation</b>:  Suppose I have an Amber player who is eagerly trying to amass power.  I can say "Caine offers to give you X, Y and Z influence if you kill King Solli," and that's pretty much forcing the conflict on them.  Or I can say "Well, you know that Caine is having problems with the trade routes in Hessh ... anyone who handed him a solution for that would certainly be remembered," and just sit back and wait.<br/>
<br/>
In the latter case, if they're the <i>wrong</i> type of players for such a tactic then they will craft a cunning solution to the problem that causes them no further trouble.  If they're the <i>right</i> type of players for such a tactic then they will deliberately take this opportunity to (for instance) cut a swath of bloody destruction that will inevitably come back to haunt them later.</div>
</blockquote>
So here's the thing though ... a lot of the stuff that I know, consciously, how to do is oriented toward posing challenges directly.  This whole thing of handing people the right materials to create their own challenges ... I know (somewhat) how to do it in my gut, but I don't <i>know-know</i> how it is done, up in my head.  I haven't fished out the techniques and pinned them to a rack of words.  Help me out here!<br/>
<br/>
I think that at least one technique has something to do with offering opportunities and prizes, rather than threats and losses ... in many ways they're two sides of the same coin ("Threat:  Village under attack by orcs" and "Prize:  Safety for the village" ... different or the same?) but the subtleties of presentation can make a big difference in how I, as a GM, think and how others, as players, perceive.  But, like I said, everything's fuzzy and ineffable for me right now.<br/>
<br/>
How do <b>you</b> do this?  And, perhaps more importantly, what words help you think about how you do it?                </div>

                            Tony, <br><br>This is one of those subjects that as soon as I read it I'm all like "OH YEA I DO THAT AND I DO IT BY... um... that... you know... thing that ... I ...um... do...." Putting the largely intuitive and gut level things into hardcode is hella hard. I'll try though, to pin down a few things. <br><br>When giving players a chance to give themselves rope, I find the words "opportuntiy" and "tempt" to work well -- especially in contrast to the words "challange" or "threaten." When I start making bangs I look less at bangs that scream, "you must react or eat it!" and more to bangs that.. well, get right on the edge of not being bangs. They are opportunities to react, rather than situations that force a reaction. <br><br>Of course the pitfall of this method is that, as you note, if the players aren't the right type of players then either the opportunity is wrapped up to neatly or else it isn't taken up at all. With a full on bang you never have to worry about wether or not people will react to it -- one way or another they have to. With an opportunity they may or may not. So at that point the "tempt" comes in. <br><br>Tempting, however, is difficult to give hard rules about, because its all social soft-skills level stuff. (To this point in history at least, I'm very interested in figuring out how to make it a mechanical process.) Right now a lot of my focus in the area hinges around knowing the players desires and such, which of course gets a huge bump from flags and similar devices. Like, in your Amber example, if Cain is just random elder amberite then the opportunity could easily fall flat. OTOH, if you chose Cain because the character in question has "get into it with Cain" as a flag, then opening up a path to Cain is a perfect way to pull them in without having to force them in, or force them in at any particular angle. <br><br>I'm tempted to say that words "push" and "pull" also help me, but considering our history on those words maybe we should let them be for the moment. If you want to go there we can, but it might be best to take it to email. <br><br/>Another trick, soft skills, is one Ron talks about a lot -- listening to table banter. Ron has argued several times in the past that the things people say in passing about the game can be just as (or more) important than what they say directly. As soon as someone at the table says, "Jesus, lucky bitch getting in on Cain's good/bad side" or anything like that a little note goes down in my brain to set up an opportunity to have that player get into it with Cain. Hell, sometimes I do it immediatly, in a "Oh yea? Think she's lucky? Well you know that Caine is having problems with the trade routes in Hessh ... anyone who handed him a solution for that would certainly be remembered."<br/><br/>The other thing about it is that I've often found that giving the player a little bit of space, free room, even without temptations for a short period of time, can help some players get comfortable with what they want to do. Too much GM tempting can become leading, again, whereas if the GM settles back and lets the player toss out the hooks and the ideas when you finally get around to opening the doors the player is often far readier to step through. It's sort of the mental/emotional equivilent of getting your feet under you so that you can start to charge, and if you're already tickling thier self-destruct bone before they even have their head down it may cause them to dash prematurely. <br/><br/>The other word that helps is, ironically, 'snap'. As in you have to keep an eye on when it is time to snap the trap closed, or to pull the lever once the player has put the slack noose around their own neck. Because in most of the games where I've had this kind of player there still comes a point at which they want you to shift course and bite down HARD. However this is the area where I most frequently screw it, and so I don't have a lot of good ideas about how to know. A game in which the players had an "okay, fuck me now" flag would be a great start, but for the nonce I mostly have to watch and wait until the player seems to be getting towards dissatisfaction and then bear down and see how they take it. <br/><br/>So, is that of any help? Would some APs of some of those things help, or are they clear enough? I know they're not mechanical and are all at the "soft skills" system level, but perhaps they can point the way towards something more mechanized.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Good start, Brand.<br/>
<br/>
I think the key is situational potential. I'm going to make up some jargon to piss people off. NPCs who need a PC, in a way that engages the player, have been called "Grabby." Contrasted to "hooks" where the character is presented with something that they can't say no to realistically.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I'd suggest that some NPCs are "Actively Grabby" and some are "Passively Grabby." That is, some NPCs come looking for the PCs and hit them over the head with some problem. But some just sit there waiting, and the opportunity to interact with them comes from thieir situation becoming known. So, for example:<br/>
<br/>
Hook: "You see the Princess being kidnapped by goblins? What do you do?"<br/>
Active Grab: "The Princess comes to you, and tells you she thinks she's in danger of being kidnapped, but you think she might be trying to embroil you in some plot at the palace."<br/>
Passive Grab: "You hear a rumor that somebody is thinking of kidnapping the princess. This meshes with what you've heard of the palace as a place of intrigue. You've also heard that the prince has been seen talking to some goblins lately."<br/>
<br/>
The latter gives the player maximal freedom to maneuver. But it also means that one of his potential maneuvers is "I leave town, becasuse things are heating up too much." Hopefully the character will have flags like "Loves to Help Damsel's in Distress" and/or "Distrusts political figures."<br/>
<br/>
See Chris Chinn's work on flags and scenario structure.<br/>

                            Thanks, Tony, this and your "prizes" thread have helped me think through something I am working on currently: How do you engage characters' personal issues in the larger issues that are at stake so that they will get involved in the situation set up by the "inciting incident"?<br><br>My thinking so far:<br><br>A common event in the Exposition phase is one or more of the characters â€œrefusing the callâ€. When they initially become aware of the situation, it isnâ€™t compelling enough to them to cause them to become involved. One of their personal goals or dilemmas must then become entangled with the overall goal or dilemma in order to motivate them.<br><br>You can hook or entangle the personal goals into the overall goal in three ways. The first two are the carrot and the stick. Either the larger goal is presented in a way that seems to offer the character a way to fulfil his or her personal goal, or else the personal goal compels the character to become involved in the larger goal. For example, say the personal goal was â€œbe respectedâ€. The â€œcarrotâ€ version of the hook-in is â€œPeople who get involved in defeating this threat will be respected.â€ The â€œstickâ€ version is â€œsomeone important to you tells you that theyâ€™ll have no respect for you unless you get involvedâ€.<br><br>The third way to engage personal goals with larger goals is to draw a parallel: â€œIn attacking us in this way, theyâ€™re disrespecting our proud tradition. We need to teach them a lesson so that theyâ€™ll respect us in the future.â€ The character with the â€œrespectâ€ issue then thinks, â€œdisrespect, I hate that, Iâ€™m in.â€<br><br>The three ways can, of course, be combined.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            I'm interested in this: For years the players in my regular group took the traditional stance of "The primary goal is to survive and succeed, so I'll do anything to make sure my character has a better chance of succeeding at whatever", and it's only recently (well, the past year) where they have come out to actively hinder their character goals, put themselves into dangerous (but FUN!) situations, etc.<br><br>In my opinion, it took a lot of patience and practice, some playing of games that award that kind of behavior, and a lot of GM influence- The last part which would take a long time to explain, but it's filled with moments where I actively encourage and praise people for putting their characters into places where there is "trouble", and say how that improves the game for everyone. When I play, I actively (not all the time like Remi or Tony) put myself in compromising situations and basically give the GM room to hang me, and eagerly give them the nod, "See? I trust you to not be a dick, to not just say "no", but to come up with a cool, interesting challenge to face and maybe, maybe not, overcome".  I wish I knew then what I know now about this subject and my players, as we could have been having more gripping, fun dramas and conflicts much earlier.<br><br>Yeah, Chris Chinn's discussion on Flags is a great starter point for this kind of thing, but only once the players are aware (as the GM) that putting your character in compromising situations for the sake of the overall plot/story is Awesome, and not Something to Be Afraid Of, or simply a chain that the GM can yank to make players squirm.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            To my brain, the question comes down to flags and reward systems.<br><br>Assuming we are talking about the subset of players who want trouble for their characters, I find that these guys typically want trouble of a specific stripe.  One player may want to become romantically entangled with a dangerous NPC; another player may want to play out a revenge blood opera; yet another player may want her own personal foibles to create cataclysmic problems a la Rodney McKay.  Whether it's a Key or an Issue or a Thematic Battery or whatever, putting this information on the character sheet is a good way to communicate player expectations.  I think of it as the players putting on pins with little red targets, pretty much saying, "Hit me <em>right here</em>."<br><br>The other bit is to engage those flags with a reward system and allow players to either explicitly create the adversity or explicitly give the GM/other players an opening to do so.  For instance: if a player narrates their character into a faux pas at the royal court, everybody else at the table may laugh at the hijinks or rush to assist their fellow player; however, if the same player narrates their character into a faux pas at the royal court and then points at the Key on their sheet or throws a token at the GM or in some way engages the system, the other folks at the table know that the player wants something to come of the situation.<br/><br/>So it seems my answer is "let the players do the heavy lifting."  Keeping an eye out for their tells, and using a system that underscores those tells, gives the GM good guidance for how to jump in and give em the hell they want.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

Mike, this is a cool way of thinking of it, although "guardian angel" sounds a bit too protective in a lot of ways...  For my style of play, I tend to feel a lot of affection for my characters -- I want things to work out for them, I want some kind of happy ending eventually.  I also want them to crawl through fire in the meantime.  This is pretty much what you're getting at, because I'm interested in forcing my character to deal with their shit and change as a person, but it's less "guardian angel" and more "ineffable god" or something.

Heh, my GM totally got me with this one during our TSOY session last week.  There's a pretty vicious baddie who keeps showing up, and I finally said at one point, "God, I think it's probably OOC, but I freaking HATE that guy and I want him DEAD."  My GM was like, "Oh, I dunno, it might not be that out of character, he's kind of out for the extermination of your race and everything."  I said, "Huh..."  The wheels start churning -- my character's a healer, she's never killed anyone, but she's also fiercely dedicated to the good of her people.  Later on in the session, he <i>totally</i> threw in some more details, and ended up getting me into a nasty conflict with the guy.  Upshot is, I've totally taken the Key of Vengeance against him and I'm completely jazzed about my healer character taking this guy out, and dealing with the repercussions.  I didn't even know going into the session that I wanted to do this with my character.  It was slick. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>
