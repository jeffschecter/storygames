I know how I will address the reader that will explain the game, what I should name the other participants and I know how I want to write in a non-gender specific way.<br/><br/><b>What I want to achieve</b> is to explain how to present the game for the players. The game is so easy to learn so only after playing it once, another player can take the role as the GM and start playing with the other participants.<br/><br/><b>What I also want to achieve</b> is to plant some basic ideas into the reader's mind:<br/>- The game is all about being creative.<br/>- It's a game that is a collaboration between all participants. No person is more important than another.<br/>- You should acknowledge the others by praising what they do.<br/>- You should inspire the others.<br/>- You should create an creative environment where everyone is feeling free to contribute.<br/>( - To answer <b>Eero</b> in an <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/398000#Comment_398000" rel="nofollow">earlier thread</a>: I want the game to use non-gender pronounce because it would be weird in a game that plant ideas, to plant ideas that's assigning different gender to different roles.)<br/><br/>I don't want to shove this up in my reader's face, but instead sneak it in and to make it an understanding. I will do this by introducing structures and exercises that the reader should use to present the game for the other players. In these structures, I will repeat the basic ideas of the game over and over again by either repeating them in text or by insinuating them.<br/><br/><b>I'm aiming for a rulebook that is at most four pages long</b>. I've been looking at boardgames and how they explain the structures of the game. I don't know if this is a realistic goal, but I don't want to exceed this goal. I would preferably have two pages rather than four. I have this goal because I want a person to buy my game, bring it to some friends, open the package and start playing after an half hour of reading. Just like a boardgame.<br/><br/>NEXT UP: the headlines.<br/><br/><i>If anyone wonders what I want out from this thread, I just want to tell that I just want my thoughts out in the air so I can organize them.

But now when I think of it, it's really a dumb idea.</i>\n<h3>P.R.E.P.</h3>\nImagine yourself flicking the the channels on the TV, when you discover a movie about a two-fisted tale. We are now going to create the elements that will appear in that movie. Decide as a group of which map that you're going to use. Take a pen and draw either a person, event or a place on the map. Write 1-3 words about it beside the drawing, and then tell the others a rumour about the place. When you're finished, hand the pen over to the person to your left. It's now that person's turn to draw, write something short about it and finally tell a rumour. The P.R.E.P. - Persons, Rumours, Events and Places -  will together create what you need to play this game. While drawing the map, you are also allowed to do the following things:\n<ul><li><b>Add something</b> to another one's drawing during your turn. "I want to add something to the golden Zeppelin. It's owned by the rich, but cruel big game hunter John Stephenson." Note that what you add must be a person, place or an event.<br/></li><li><b>Create an issue</b> about another player's drawing during your turn. "That Inca pyramid ... has disappeared. A prophecy tells that it will reappear somehow." Remember that you still need to draw it on the map.</li>\n<li><b>Ask questions</b>, either if you're curious about someone else's rumour, to clarify someone's drawing or if anyone has a hard time adding something to the map. If the last thing happens, never give examples. Instead, ask questions that will help your friend. What kind of questions can give inspiration? How did you come up with a drawing yourself? Is it something that the players hasn't understood, like why we are adding things to the map? Is it clear what kind of things to add? Can you ask a leading question about a person, a place or the map itself?</li>\n<li><b>Demand help</b> from the others. They will help you by asking questions.</li>\n<li><b>Praise each other</b>. If you think an idea is cool, say it.</li></ul>\nAfter drawing two things each on the map, you're done with the P.R.E.P.<br/><br/><i>I almost gave examples of questions (Never give examples!), when I instead should ask questions on how to ask questions.</i> <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<h5>Choose characters</h5>\nTell the others to randomly select three characters each and pick one of them. They just need to read the name, the short description under the name and look at the picture. When they all have chosen one character each, tell them to read the notes beside the picture and the two moves that are described under the notes. You don't get to draw a character, because your role in this game is going to be slightly different. What your role is and how the character's move works are something that we're going to explain later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400790/#Comment_400790" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T06:38:55+00:00" title="December 14, 2012  6:38AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 16, 2012 1:59PM by Rickard.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://schizoart.tumblr.com/post/35012732552/theres-going-to-be-a-lot-of-wind-all-over-this" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" height="250px" src="http://erebaltor.se/rickard/TiP_helen.jpg" style="float: right;"/></a><i>I will try to write one headline per day so the text finally will be written. It's more important at this stage to get it written than have it written in a good way.</i>\n<h3>Play</h3>\nThe game consist of three acts in which you will play out several scenes. The game is all about being creative and collaborate, by taking each others ideas and give it a spin.\n<h5>Create the first scene</h5>\nIt's time to learn about your role in the game. One of your duties is to create scenes which is basically to tell where the the characters are in the world.\n<ol><li>Roll on the Table of Locations on your [what ever I will call that sheet] and read the result out loud. "You are in a tomb."</li>\n<li>Ask one of the players make up an object that should be in that location.</li>\n<li>Add something to the player's answer. You must start the sentence with "and". "...and that sarcophagi has some inscriptions on the lid."</li>\n<li>Ask another player to make up another object on the location.</li>\n<li>Create an issue that has something to do with the player's answer. You must start your sentence with "but". "...but in the mirror you can see something move!"</li></ol>\nTell everybody what this exercise was about: that you can ask questions, add something to another person's description with "and" or create issues with "but". Point out that you're not the only one allowed to do this. One player may for example add something to another player's description as well. Keep the descriptions short! "You're in a tomb" or "You find a sarcophagi" is enough. By keeping the descriptions short, you all allow other players to either add or create issues with what you've come up with, even if it's just a location. This is how you collaborate.<br/><br/>Finally, let the players introduce their characters to each other. The name and the description under the name will do just fine. When they are done, ask them how they know each other and what they are doing at the location. Their answer has to include something on the map. This creates the goal of the game; something the characters strives for. It may be freeing hostages from the big game hunter John Stephenson or to find the vanished Inca pyramid.<br/><br/><i>I should give the goal more weight, because it's the goal of the characters that will make the adventure happen.

Each scene starts with you telling the others a location where the characters are. In the first scene, you roll the location, but for the rest of the game you create a scene in one of four ways.\n<ul><li>Continue the last scene, by making up a new trouble.</li>\n<li>Start the scene with how they travel to the next location.</li>\n<li>Pick a new location from the P.R.E.P. map. It doesn't matter if they jump around a lot. They may be under water in one scene and in the next in a volcano.</li>\n<li>Ask the players where the new scene takes place.</li></ul>\nAfter telling the location, you should also create a trouble by including who or what else is in the scene and how it puts the characters in danger. The danger is created in one of the following ways:\n<ul><li>By using something from the P.R.E.P. map. A location can have either an activity or an occupant that puts the characters in danger. How would a place like a volcano cause trouble for the characters?.</li>\n<li>Take something the player just said, and add "Yes, but" to create an issue.</li>\n<li>Throw the characters out of something.</li>\n<li>Ask the others what the danger is.</li></ul>\nEach act gives you four scene tokens (the red ones) and one act token (white). Whenever you present the trouble, throw any number of the five tokens on the map to show how long the scene is, starting with the red ones. If it's the first scene, add as many scene tokens as the number of characters. The danger can't be solved until the scene ends, but the scene can end before the danger is solved. A scene goes towards it's end when the others act through their characters.<br/><br/><i>I really need to rewrite this whole part to improve the flow. I wonder if it's confusing when I switch between "trouble" and "danger" for the same thing.

The players can remove them by using one of the two moves on the character's sheet. If the players haven't read the moves yet, give them time to read them through.<br/><br/>[an example of a move, with curly brackets from each item on the list, showing that the first side effect wounds a character, the second one delays the character, and the last item on the list destroys something in the scene.]<br/><br/>When a move is used, the players takes a step towards ending the scene. The player using the move must describe what the character wants to achieve, and must also include in the description all three side effects the comes with each move. The three side effects are: a character gets wounded, the character taking the move gets delayed, something gets destroyed in the scene. The last side effect is something that the players can use for their advantage: if they are in a dog fight or wants to blow up a wall, the result is pretty obvious. If the player chooses to wound anyone, it must be one of the characters. The player must describe where the character is and how it's wounded.<br/><br/>Each player got five dice each which may be rolled before the move is described. The player using a move can use any number of dice from from it's own pot. All dice are rolled at the same time, and the player may leave out one side effect for each die that shows 3-6. The successful dice are put into your bowl, and the rest are put in the players' bowl. They will get them back later.\n<ul>Example: A player choose to roll three dice and they show 2, 3 and 6. The player can ignore two of the three side effects when describing the character's action. The die that showed 2 is put into the players' bowl and the two successful dice are put into your bowl.</ul>\n<i>These last two paragraphs was hard to write, because I want to write genderless.</i><br/><br/>After the description, the player is allowed to take a token from the map, and the next person may use a move. If no players act, put anyone with the lowest amount of tokens into trouble. The players can't use any moves if they got more scene tokens than any other player, so everybody has to act before the same player can go again. When the scene tokens are gone, create a new scene.<br/><br/>The white act token can't be use until the very last scene in the act, and it can't be taken while on the map if there are any scene tokens left. Whenever a player takes the act token, all can chip in to narrate how it ends, but the player taking the token goes first. The act then ends, and a new act starts with five new tokens (four red and one white).<br/><br/><i>I'm not really satisfied with how this whole headline turned out. It jumps to much from one thing to another. I will probably do a check list of everything. I wonder if I can tell the reader to do something in a certain way without having to fall back on lists.</i>\n<h5>Wounds</h5>\nWhen the characters gets wounds, the player assigning the wound must describe where the character is and how the character gets wounded. The number of wounds the character can take depends on the number of characters: if there are only two, they got four wounds each. Three characters got three wounds, and four players got two wounds each.<br/><br/>The wounds are best marked by paper clips on the character sheet, and every time a character get a wound, the player moves the paper clip one step to the right. If any character gets to the circle that says "lost", you have say "Yes, and" after the player's description, and tell everybody how the character get lost from the rest of the group, either by getting kidnapped, by falling down into something, getting trapped, getting stuck and pulled away, being taken by the river or whatever you can think of. A character who's lost may not return until the next act, and can't receive any more wounds.<br/><br/><i>I'm reconsidering making a list of how the character can get lost.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401112/#Comment_401112" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-17T16:34:26+00:00" title="December 17, 2012  4:34PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I must have missedit earlier: What does PREP stand for?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401115/#Comment_401115" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-17T16:42:54+00:00" title="December 17, 2012  4:42PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Persons, Rumours, Events, Places.<br/><br/>Good that you ask.

They will only return to the players' bowl when you activate your moves on your [whatever-I-should-call-the-sheet]. One move affects the characters and the other affects the scene by adding blue scene tokens. Declare out loud which move you use, take any number of dice from your bowl and roll them. Any die that shows 1 or 2 let you pick one effect out of the four. You may put all successful dice on one effect or spread them out. Be sure to describe what each effect does, and remember, if you ever get stuck: ask the others for help. Put all used dice, successful as unsuccessful, into the players bowl.<br/><br/>You are only allowed to use your moves after a player has acted in a scene or if there is at least one token left in the scene. You're also not allowed to take two moves in a row. If you add blue scene tokens to the scene, they must be taken before the players can take any red ones. Both blue and red tokens are returned to you when an act ends.<br/><br/><b>Epilogue</b><br/>When a player takes the third and last white act token, the game is near it's end. Ask if anyone has an idea of how it should end, and let everybody give a short suggestion. It's then up to the player who took the last token to describe how it ends with help of both the moves and the suggestions given by the others. Like always when an act ends, everybody may chip in to give details of the events.<br/><br/>After the adventure is complete, it's time to give the adventure a title. It's common to start the title with a name, as in the examples that you've read in the first pages, but it's not necessary. Discuss what the most outstanding event was or what the story was built around, and let everybody give suggestions of a title. Come to an agreement of which was the best title and write it on P.R.E.P. map.<br/><br/>Congratulations!

The other players are going to play one character each in an expedition, and we will watch how they trip over things, wound themselves and destroy things along the way to the end. The game is played out in three acts, and every act consist of several scenes. You are going to create trouble in every scene, and it's up to the players how the trouble is solved. It's going to be creative, fun and a lot of action.<br/><br/><i>I wonder if I tell something about the "storytelling" part or if I will just let the reader slide into that.</i>\n<h5>Setup</h5>\nGive each player, except for yourself, five dice and a paper clip each. Find a pen and two bowls and put them so everybody can reach them. Put the twelve character sheets in a stack face down. Order the eleven tokens in colours (red, white and blue) in front of you.<br/><br/><i>I did a crude layout, and the whole manual is almost 2,5 pages long. Perfect!
