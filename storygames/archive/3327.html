Now, I'd never seen the book before and only knew a little bit about the setting and the game. My Chinese history is weak. The only thing in my favour was that I've seen many, many wuxia films. <br/><br/>None of this mattered - Qin rocked. Hard.<br/><br/>On paper the system seems needlessly fiddly. In play it worked really quite elegantly. The lynchpin of all the powers, and indeed the whole game, are chi points, and the system actively encourages you to spend them freely because it's so easy to get them back again. The taos were fantastic - these are all the wuxia powers, but rather than requiring endless book-referencing, they were very simple yet evocative. No dice rolls to see if you can run up the wall to get to the guy at the top in the face - if you have the right tao, just spend your chi, narrate the wuxia coolness and roll to hit. <br/><br/>My girl was an exiled noble, disowned by her father for refusing an arranged marriage. I had these mean-ass short swords and techniques that let me parry and dodge better when using both. Best of all I had the Tao of One Thousand Bees which was the House of Flying Daggers tao - I could use anything as a thrown weapon, and proceeded to spend the game flinging pine cones and stones at my enemies with lethal force. Even better, I could catch incoming missiles - handy when the Qin soldiers started firing crossbow bolts at us.<br/><br/>I won't go into any detail about the game, just a cool vignette of the climactic fight. In short, I'd been summoned home by my father, who had written to say he had forgiven me and wanted me to inherit his land. But before we could get home and sign the will, my supposedly dead brother had turned up and offed him, and sold the land to our sworn enemies - the Qin. <br/><br/>So we burst in with the evidence of his treachery, lock the door and fling the evidence down on the table, sending scrolls flying. The brother stabbed the official sent to supervise the signing of the will so out came the weapons. But I didn't go for mine - I stood up, grabbed my stool and hurled it at him with such force that he went staggering back, giving me time to draw my swords, jump on the table and engage him in melee. At the same time Five Dragons, my companion, had drawn his sword, ran round the side of the walls and slashed my brother in two with a well-placed sword strike.<br/><br/>A combat fit for any wuxia movie, evocative and dramatic and fun, fully supported and encouraged by the system. I want to play a campaign of this right now!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75278/#Comment_75278" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-13T05:48:49+00:00" title="June 13, 2007  5:48AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Where did the ideas for the game come from?

I just got to enjoy the awesome. The GM was running it as a demo game to see if we liked it, so did all the work himself for the story. If we play a proper campaign it'll be much more player driven stories. I can't comment whether the game supports one way or another.<br/><br/>It was very much task resolution, but the chi mechanic works very well to make that a lot more flexible. <br/><br/>I had a flick through the list of taos - there do seem to be a lot! But they're very light, mechanically. We never needed to look them up beyond what was on our character sheets, put it that way. Not much in the way of rules, and very modular so you can easily wind up with a swordfighting exorcist or something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JongWK" title="JongWK"><img alt="JongWK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JongWK">JongWK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76540/#Comment_76540" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-18T17:24:39+00:00" title="June 18, 2007  5:24PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Who ran it?

The space for them on the back of the character sheet is more than enough to write a brief summary with all the information need. Too bad I don't have my character sheet with me, or else I'd scan it and show you. I don't think you'll have a problem running the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
