                    Wow, I feel like I have tons to talk about but I am going to kick this off with a few of the highlights and add more later...<br/><br/>I consider going to conventions a sub hobby within gaming for me.  I have had a few years of a convention a month and others where I only do four cons.  This is going to be a heavy convention year and I must say that Dreamation was a fantastic start to the year.  I have nothing like it.  Until communities like this and the Forge I would have said I run pretty obscure games.  So it never surprised me when I had a game or two fold due to lack of players.  I would have never imagined that not only did all five of my games go off all were near capacity.  The room was packed all the time.  Some folk had to find tables in the hotel lobby.  The night of the Indie party many of us moved our games to the party rooms (two seperate small banquet rooms on another floor).<br/><br/>The games I played and the ran I had were all top-notch good times.  Good people, good games.  Damn this is what conventioning should be.  It was particularly cool to see little pockets of game design chat and community bonding happening.  Meeting all you fine folks and getting to get down to really talk about our hobby in mostly positive ways (okay so we did a little mudslinging) was refreshing and filled out this great event.<br/><br/>I am pleased to be the first to say many thanks to all who helped put this together.  Make no mistake that you <b>made</b> Dreamation what it is today.<br/><br/>A final word about the convention.  A congoer, Frank, was wandering around in the Indie room.  It was late (we were the last event there and I the last to leave the Indie Explosion room for the weekend) and he seemed to be just charging his batteries.  His nephew had gotten him involved in a D&amp;D game in the other RPG room.  He relayed this story to us.  There was a point where the players were acting out their visit to a local merchant and the DM turned to them and said "We really won't have enough time to do any roleplaying in this game."<br/><br/>We all died laughing.                </div>

                            Cross posted with the original Dreamation thread:<br/><br/>That was a blast! I wish the next Dreamation was next week!<br/><br/>I had so much fun... I may explode! I played amazing games of Dictionary of Mu with Judd and Dogs in the Vineyard with Vincent. I met lots of people from Story Games, The Forge, and even people I talk to every day on nerdnyc but have never met! Awesome!!! Made lots of new friends! I did an interview for Judd and Jeff (which was terrifying at first)! I talked about my wrestling game at the indy game seminar and I was thrilled with the interest and feedback. I bought lots of new games. Played lots and lots of Jungle Speed! I spread the word about nerdnyc. My favorite moment at the con was the stakes of my initiation scene in Dogs... "Do I shoot my father... a second time!". The dealer room was pretty small but they had a few cool boardgames I was looking for. I was amazed at how many great RPGs events were available. Indie games have taken over!!! Seriously! It was sick! I headlocked, hugged, and wrestled many old and new friends! Keith was by far my favorite target!<br/><br/>Wow, there are sooo many cool, fun, friendly and creative people in the world. I hope to meet more of you and spend more time sharing life, trash talking, headlocks and more with those I've had the good pleasure to meet.<br/><br/>I dropped my bag on some lady on the bus back home which was awful of me! But I hit Keith too so it made up for it! I almost seduced Keith to come home with me on the ride back to JFK but no luck... this time! There is always Forge Con!<br/><br/>I'm really, really looking forward to Russell Collins' game!<br/><br/>Dreamation was fantastic. Next year will only be better! The people who organize it do a really, really great job!<br/><br/>My fiancÃ© Terry who many of you met but doesn't post here also had an amazing time!                        </div>

                            There were a few low points:  <br/>I didn't say "hey" to enough people.  There were some people, like Ben, that I ran into and saw in passing but never intro'd myself.<br/><br/>And I didn't get a chance to play Dogs, Mu or Heroes Banner.

Yeah, I can safely say "I had a great time with Matt" and cover about half the attendees.  Plus it is true.                        </div>

                            So what my Dreamtion looked like:<br/><br/>I came to the convention like any other, forgetting that one thing that I would need for the convention.  Only this time it was my entire game!  Ugh!  "Oh, and Don, I hope your ready 'cause all eight slots are filled."  Ugh!  Rewrite characters until 4am.  Get up at 7am and print them out.<br/><br/>Okay, game one done!  Game two is the BE World Burning Workshop.  It was way cool and soon I will post the world they created on the BE Wiki.  Vinnie, the con coord, walked around and counted - 14 games scheduled thus far, 14 games run!  He shakes his head in pleased disbelief.<br/><br/>I take a break (uber migraine which is a new experience for me) so I am pluckier for my midnight game.  Come the 12 o'clock hour and sure enough here marches in four troopers excited to play out my modern shakespearian drama in the mad city.  It went well and my first try at DYRH proves I will be running this again!  I was mentioning the next day how the best aspects of the game came down to Shakespear tropes (namely the mistaken identities).  It was interesting to see a good game turn great simply by starting to embrace simple ideas.  I will try to write an AP sometime in the next week. <br/><br/>18 hours down.  And that was only Friday!<br/><br/>Okay, so Saturday comes and my buddy Matt is interested in <b>Carry</b>.  Hell, I'm up.  Let's go!  I am glad I did.  As much of a Vietnam buff I am I didn't think I would ever buy this game.  After the session I walked straight to the IPR booth where Emily happily took my money.<br/><br/>Thanks, BTW for the good folks that took time to man the books and cash. You all did a great job.  I was astonished to see so much great product in one place.<br/><br/>I had a relaxed afternoon and a great dinner hosted by Mike and Kat Miller.  Good food and great conversation followed by tons of dark chocalate from the Dreamation crew.<br/><br/>I thought, there's only two people signed up for my Artesia game, I might as well can it and play something else... "Uh, no Don, we wrangled a bunch of people to play."  *blink, blink*  Okay.  So I had a great game, the highlight of which was a player that had never roleplayed before!  They said they had a great time and all was vindicated when the new player sees the Duel of Wits and claims "Wow, a way I can acually put my Rhetoric degree to work!"<br/><br/>Midnight rolls around again... bah, I'm and alternate to a game I REALLY wanted to play!  Bill White: "Nah, we can take everyone!"  And thus a seven player game ensues.  If I hadn't bought the game earlier I would have knocked on Brennan's door at 4am to buy it.  Thank me, Brennan, for my foresight <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  Gosh this game was cool.  it worked well with eight people.  I think it will rock even more with fewer and thanks to Bill I can't wait to try it out.<br/><br/>Second 18 hours down!  Gosh I feel like I'm 18 again... only more tired...LOL.<br/><br/>We do a little sleeping in and after we order at the hotel restaurant "Hey Don, isn't that Mark (Smylie)?"  Oh, yeah.  I proceed to describe our ides for the MouseGuard boardgame and Mark's like "Very Cool.  Can you have a playable version by NY ComicCon to show to MouseGuard's creator?"  Damn skippy! (Now I know what I am doing for the month of February).<br/><br/>Sunday afternoon.  Well, no one's gonna wanna make BE characters in teh last slot of the convention... "Uh, Don, is there any room so I can bring in some friends?"  *shakes head* Sure!  I only have two books and a PDF in my laptop but we'll work through it.  Some great paths and beliefs were hammered out.  Some folks didn't finish and they were like "well, if you don't mind I'll finish it and email it to you!"  Holy crap!  Okay!<br/><br/>So yeah, this was a positive experience.  Everyone was gaming and gaming a lot.  In our room I saw nothing but smiles and the shaping of lasting friendships.  I felt like I was in another world.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: eruditus</cite>Vinnie, the con coord, walked around and counted - 14 games scheduled thus far, 14 games run! He shakes his head in pleased disbelief.</blockquote>Okay, let me interject, because this was a serious question in the organizing of the game track.  There was concern that we were going to start overserving a small population, and end up with games spread thin and many slots running at low capacity or entirely empty.<br/><br/>What was attendance at the slots like, people?                        </div>

                            Tony --<br/><br/>Nay to the naysayers.  The slots were full.  Usually overfull (both alternates full and people clamoring to elbow in).  Except from time to time, demand for our games vastly exceeded our supply of them.  (I'm one of the exceptions: Only three of my four games ran, but that's because in the last slot I cancelled -- too tired.)<br/><br/>Also, lots of blue badges.  It wasn't just us playing our own games -- there were people coming up from hours away just to get a chance to play their favorite games with the designers.  More this year than any one previous.<br/><br/>Do you know the huge room that all RPGs are run in?  We filled it, every table regularly.  They had to boot the RPGA upstairs into hotel rooms (poor guys) and eventually set up overflow rooms for us.<br/><br/>I think it's safe to say that this was the year that Indie Games Explosion exploded.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>

                            9 AM games were dodgy but all other slots seemed to do pretty well. I got the impression that there were a lot of indie folks playing the indie games, but that there were other curious people jumping in, too. The indie games were largely full, with alternates waiting to get in if someone didn't show up. If anything, we needed <i>more</i> indie games being run during prime time slots -- especially the popular games like Burning Wheel, Dogs, Capes, Spirit of the Century, Sorcerer, and .<br/><br/>I don't know that traditional games got the love they deserved. What with all the new game-candy sitting there, did people eat their vegetables? I know a bunch of folks jumped into D&amp;D games. I'm curious what other traditional games were played by the "indie crowd."                        </div>

                            As mentioned my 9am's were all full.  There were less games than other slots but they were still pretty packed.<br/><br/>I was one of the people worried and I have to say I was shocked and elated that I was wrong.  Nearly all my games were played by "BluBadges*."  It was cool to see more folk than me and Luke running BW.                        </div>

                            Dreamation was the awesome. I'm still slightly unhinged from lack of sleep, and my voice sounds like what I imagine a rock monster's would sound like.<br/><br/>I had six games scheduled, but only four of them (really) went off. No one showed for one of my Unistat sessions, except a few friends. It wasn't much of a session...in fact, it wasn't really a session at all, since we only talked about the game instead of actually playing it. Then we left early so that I could play in the Jungle Speed finals, which was good, since I won. I'll be playing for the big title come DexCon.<br/><br/>The other session that folded was my Sunday morning session of Universalis. Now, I feel terrible about this one, because it was my fault. Come Sunday morning, I hear tell that I had players. I can't be sure, myself, since I wasn't there. Where was I? Passed out at home. When I set my alarm the night before, I must have knocked the plug out in my sleep-addled stupor. I'm still beating myself up over this one.<br/><br/>However, I did have four awesome sessions. The first was my zombie apocalypse Unistat game. It was cool, though it turned out to be a comedy instead of a serious game like I'd first imagined. Hell, I'm only the GM, my opinion hardly counts. Fun was had, and a spontaneous game design session popped up since we finished early. We finished early because I decided to muck around with the dice distribution, thinking it would work better. Not so much, I found out. In a neat little turn, one of my players was this guy Ralph. I'm like, "Cool, a blue badge. It's nice to get Joe Random Gamer instead of all indie folks. Then someone mentions "Mazza," and I'm like, "Huh, that's crazy, there's this other Ralp Mazza who designed one of my favorite games ever." And he's all, "Uhm, yeah...that's me." Crap! One of my design idols is sitting at my table and I didn't even know it. Awsome full of awesomeness. Oh, and Frank H. is one of the coolest people ever. "Silver don't turn lead, herd." You know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Next up was my Capes: Mean Streets session. It was cool, and it worked out very nicely. I think the pregenerated characters helped a lot. Though maybe not every character needs some form of "Brutal Violence" as a trait. I'm thinking I just might put together a Capes expansion on this theme, if Tony's cool with that.<br/><br/>Then it was time for DitV. I was a bad GM and didn't brush up on the rules. So there were several points where I had to frantically look through the book for a rule here and there. Thankfully, Jason Morningstar was there to pull my ass out of the fire once or twice. I think I did a crappy job of GMing, but the players all seemed to have fun, so that's good. Oh, and in a first for me, it was a convention game of Dogs that had no one shot in the face (or anywhere else, for that matter), and no weddings dissolved or enacted on unwilling townsfolk. Crazy. Is that even Dogs anymore? <br/><br/>The final session was probably one of my favorite ones ever in the history of ever. It was the "Choose Your Own Adventure" session of Unistat. I was totally comfortable with the idea of jumping into an established setting at the drop of a hat, but when only one player had a preference, I got worried. When it was a movie I haven't seen in years, I got even more worried. But it went off awesomely. The rabid "Labyrinth" fan was totally jazzed about how the game really let her live in the world and explore what happened after the movie. Oh, and a first-time gamer said, "Wow, this dorky thing you do is actually really cool."  Sadly, I turned Frank and his nephew away because the slots were full, forcing them to endure the "We don't have time to role-play" game. Many apologies, Frank.<br/><br/>I'll get actual play posted as soon as I can, but I'm still falling down tired.<br/><br/>I was one of the folks who thought we might have shot ourselves in our collective foot, and I was thrilled to be wrong about the demand. I turned away alternates in almost every session. It was great.<br/><br/>Did anyone else notice that the Indie Games Explosion track was wider than the general "RPG" track? That was crazy. Sure, if you add in NAGA,and RPGA, we were only like a quarter or a third of the RPGs....wait.....that's <b>awesome</b>!!!<br/><br/>I am so pumped right now I can't even convey it. I'll be posting more this week, once I catch up on my sleep.                        </div>

I don't think I had the brain power to manage the session, and I was just as content to sit around chatting with people. I think we had one other player besides Adam and I, and it looked like she got pulled into a Burning Wheel game. I wouldn't beat yourself up too bad.                        </div>

<p>Sunday morning is a tough time to run a game. This is a creative thing we do and three days with poor sleep, constant talking, and a marathon of creativity can lead to very poor creative abilities come Sunday. I'm always surprised when anything <em>does</em> work out.</p>

That would have been Vanessa, who did play Mordred in BW "Quest for the Grail" and wound up becoming King of England.  So, all's well that ends well.<br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: eruditus</cite>I was very surprised that my Sunday morning Character Burning Worshop was FULL!</blockquote>It's a different type of creative challenge, and (to my mind) less of an on-the-spot one.  I, for one, am very much <b>not</b> surprised that it filled up on a sunday morning.  I'm thinking that more events like that which are an exciting part of a roleplaying game but not necessarily the whole enchilada would be a very good spice to have on hand in cooking the schedule for future conventions.                        </div>

                            I am happy to say that almost* my entire PTA table (6 players) consisted of people who had never played PTA before.  I think that they also only had blue badges.  I asked Vinnie, and we weren't over 50% of the RPGs, but we were the largest bloc.  And we were over 50% of the non-Naga, non-RPGA RPGs.<br/><br/>He said that we probably will only be 30% of DexCon in July.  I think there's a chance we can replicate the Dreamation experience, however.<br/><br/>* One person had played before, but it was the first-version rules he'd played.                        </div>
