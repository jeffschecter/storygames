It\u2019s heavily influenced by Stephen King\u2019s \u2018<b>The Running Man</b>\u2019 (the book, not the film\u2026  NOT the film).<br/><br/>You play a team of contestants on an international game show called The Gauntlet.  You\u2019re dropped off in the woods at night with a pack of supplies and a bag of cash.  After 6 hours, they\u2019re going to send out the hunters.  Your name will appear on every network on the globe.  Every hour you survive, your family gets $5,000.<br/><br/>The game uses <b>physical resolution</b> (as per the competition requirements).  If you\u2019re curious about that, you could look at the <a href="http://cobwebgames.com/index.php/category/two-games-one-name/" rel="nofollow">blog</a>.<br/><br/>PCs are going to have three <b>sets</b> of stats.  They\u2019re going to work like a see-saw (so having a high score in one will negatively affect the other).  I need to figure out what sorts of pairings would be useful and interesting in a game about violence and pursuit.<br/><br/>Before I go any further, I\u2019d like to say that I want this game to explore consequences of redemption.  In other words, I want this game to ask the question, \u2018how far are you willing to go for your freedom?\u2019  I imagine the PCs getting into hairy situations with the hungry public (who win cash if they betray the contestants to the network), and in resolving these conflicts I imagine a pretty high cruelty count.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Here are my pairings so far</span>:<br/><br/><b>Defiance vs. Evasion<br/>Empathy vs. Logic<br/>? vs. ?</b><br/><br/>Defiance is for confrontation, Evasion is for evading, Empathy is the catch-all social bit, Logic is for ruthlessness, and also technology.  What am I missing here?  If you were playing a game about getting away, what pair of motivating stats would you expect?<br/><br/>Sebastian.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238638/#Comment_238638" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-21T17:02:35+00:00" title="October 21, 2009  5:02PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 21, 2009 5:03PM by Graham.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You don't really have a Sneaky thing there.

Not annoying in the slightest.  I was loathe to use Fight vs. Flight as I'm in the middle of a bout of DRYH.  But screw my ego.  I can use the same terms as other designers.  Otherwise I'd have to invent a new f***ing language. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Now, Sneaky... Okay.  I intended to use Evasion/Flight for that sort of thing.  Too broad?  The tricking idea... a catch all for lies, disguises and traps?  What opposes it?  I don't see the value in Honesty as an attribute in this game of rocky morals.<br/><br/>So far there's Fight =  Balls (physical + social), Flight = Dodge (pursuit + sneaky), Head = Brains (books + strategy), Heart = Empathy (insight + charm), and Trickery = Trickiness (Deceit + Sabotage).<br/><br/>I need one more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238722/#Comment_238722" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-22T08:05:48+00:00" title="October 22, 2009  8:05AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bump.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/artexercise" title="artexercise"><img alt="artexercise" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://artexercise.mygamesonline.org/graphics/Dragon_Icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/artexercise">artexercise</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238725/#Comment_238725" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-22T08:30:53+00:00" title="October 22, 2009  8:30AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heart and Trickery seem to be more at odds on your see-saw.

First we used Fight, Flight, Thought, Action, Trickery &amp; Heart.  There was a bit of cross-over confusion when Trickery would be used instead of Heart, and the segregation of those two diluted both.  The same issue cropped up with Action and Fight.<br/><br/>After that, we tried it without just the four attributes.  Fight for confrontations, defiance and physical prowess, Flight for sneaking, hiding and getting away, Head for hacking, smarts and using technology, and Heart for insight, deception and manipulation.  I think I'm happy with just the 4 stats.  They cover everything in as much detail as is needed, I reckon.<br/><br/>However, the naming is less suited than I'd like.  Part of the flavour of the game will come from these stats, so I'd like them to evoke turmoil, tension and violence.<br/><br/>Overt v Covert, Murder v Theft, War v Retreat<br/><br/>Apathy v Empathy, Forge v Con, Brains v Charms                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238809/#Comment_238809" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-22T17:28:23+00:00" title="October 22, 2009  5:28PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought the ones you had covered everything you'd want.
