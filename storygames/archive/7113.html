The author of Maid RPG got this, and made the GM into the Master, who all the Maids have to adore and serve. Hah!<br/><br/>But in general, I think it's a service to a game designer for someone to run their game for them. Not in terms of playtesting (though that's also a service) but simply in terms of letting them reflect on their own design, after its done, from a position that they don't usually get to see.<br/><br/>So, I'd like to propose a game designer game-mastering exchange program. Any game designer I'm likely to see soon (so that means "lives in the Pacific NW or maybe at GenCon?): I'll run your game for you if you will do the same for someone else, later, in "pay it forward" style.<br/><br/>No playtests.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158256/#Comment_158256" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-23T19:16:45+00:00" title="July 23, 2008  7:16PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 23, 2008 7:17PM by Josh Roby.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, Ben, I'll take you up on that. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>And you are absolutely right.  That's something that was a big part of <em>Sons of Liberty</em>'s design -- the Tory player needs to be just as fun, in a different way, as the Patriots.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
