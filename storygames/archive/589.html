                    Okay, we've already got a couple other threads on <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=570" rel="nofollow">GM Advancement</a>, but I'm going to spin this one off in a slightly different direction.  We've got the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=582" rel="nofollow">Experimenting with GM Advancement</a> thread where we've thrown <em>Dogs in the Vineyard</em> onto the operating table, opened it up, and starting playing with its guts.  While interesting, each suggestion diverges <em>Dogs</em> a little bit, and some of the suggestions I think would really unbalance what is a very finely-tuned and well thought out game design.<br/><br/>What I'd like to do in this thread is brainstorm on potential, unwritten games that might use GM Advancement in a way that is central or essential to its operation.  Consider how important escalation is to Dogs; I want to see proposed games where GM Advancement is just as important.  So like:<br/><br/><b>The Every Fantasy Novel You've Ever Read RPG</b><br/>Players create plucky no-name characters in a fantasy setting.  They are going to save the entire fucking world, and maybe the universe, too.  However, they don't start there.  Play is divided into chapters.  In each chapter, the GM has a set budget to create adversity.  It starts at, say, 100 points.  At the end of the chapter, the GM hands out XP and the players give her GM XP.  If the GM earns five points of GM XP, in the next chapter, she's got 105 points in her budget to create more adversity.<br/><br/>So in the first chapter, the PCs have to deal with, say, some bullies.  The chapter  also allows them to settle into character and learn the fiddly bits of the system.  Then in the next chapter, with a larger budget, the GM is able to afford, say, a little political crisis at the castle.  By the next chapter, the GM is able to pull off some eldritch supernatural threat.  Then the GM graduates to full blown civil war, and the next chapter she reveals that the first supernatural baddy was in fact just a servant of an even more powerful creature, and so on.<br/><br/>What other games would benefit from GM Advancement?                </div>

                            What about an organized crime RPG, where the GM currency is mistrust, and the player currency is connections?  So the players get to decide who they're connected to, and this increases as the players do awesome stuff, but the GM gets to decide who doesn't trust them and how much, and this increases as the GM does awesome stuff.  Obstacles that come out of an NPC's mistrust get an additional difficulty of that character's Mistrust rating, giving the GM a reason to use the characters that they've advanced the Mistrust of to drive the plot.  (This is particularly nice as the GM can increase the rating of an obstacle - and watch as the players climb all over themselves to find out who doesn't trust them!)<br/><br/>JBR, I'd like to hear a little more about this "budget to create adversity" part of your idea.  It seems like you're basically suggesting a mechanic where the GM gets a resource to spend on adversity, and then connecting it to the fantasy novel trope.  I'd suggest that it's the connecting part that's hard, and I'd be curious how you'd design that part of the system.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            My suggestion, Jess, is about as bog-standard as I could make it, primarily because I find it hard to think in terms of GMed games any more.  In any case, remembering that I'm an old GURPShead, I envisioned something like buying obstacles/monsters/badguys out of a budget of points.  Sort of like "Dragon, 30pts; Pit Trap, 5pts; Bounty Hunter, 25pts; et cetera."<br/><br/>Your idea sounds interesting, though, and that's more what I was after in starting this thread -- the obvious choices like buying dragons and pit traps are things that anybody can think of, but they're not that interesting when you get right down to it.  It's the clever twists to the basic idea -- GM plays mistrust against player connections -- that can make an idea like this sing.                        </div>

                            I didn't realize this thread was so long ago, but here is another idea for a game that might make sense to be GM-Advancement-Driven:<br/>
<br/>
The Bodyguard Game, in which you take the roles of a political VIP in some unstable, disaster-torn land (like, say, Africa) and his (her?) crack (or not so crack) team of bodyguards.<br/>
<br/>
So the GM is the VIP, right? <br/>
<br/>
As the VIP, the GM starts with a campaign budget, a low level political position, and ambitions, proceeding from there to attempt to work his way up the political food-chain - dragging his bodyguards, the players' characters, along with him.<br/>
<br/>
So it is the VIP's political ambitions that put his wellbeing, as well as the wellbeing of his bodyguards, on the line. And that doesn't just have to be "do you get shot?", but also all sorts of pychological and social "costs" to close calls and failures of protection. (Costs in terms of things to hook continued play on, or to feed into the game's ending, however it would work.)<br/>
<br/>
I'd imagine gain and loss of rivals &amp; friends (external relationships) would be important parts of play, as well. Also the Bodyguards (and the VIP) would need to have various character traits to entangle play around!<br/>
<br/>
You'd have to figure out (or steal) some sort of mechinism that rewards the players separately from their characters and the team to open room for all those fun sorts of traumatic deaths and shocking betrayals, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
The core principle is that the advancement  of the VIP's political career competes directly with the Bodyguard's ability to keep him safe - i'm thinking of it as exactly some kind of budget: expenditure vs risk, with the challenges (and rewards) arising directly from that.<br/>
<br/>
Sound interesting/workable? I'm not sure if it really fits with the topic, but it seems close...                        </div>
