When you experience something horrific, roll a d6, and if it's higher than your current Insanity level, you gain a level. This has worked well in as a one-shot system: I find that at least one or two PCs reaches 6 Insanity within a four-hour slot.<br/><br/>In <i>Unnamable</i>, the insanity mechanic is pretty much the same, but uses a d20 instead. You start at 20 Sanity, and if your d20 roll is less than your current level, you 1) lose a point of Sanity, 2) gain a point of Madness, and 3) place that point into one of the Madness boxes that help you in certain circumstances.<br/><br/>I like the idea of Madness as a mechanical reward, but I'm concerned that 20 points of Sanity is too much. Might try 12 points/a d12 the first time out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444862/#Comment_444862" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-19T16:02:50+00:00" title="April 19, 2015  4:02PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I like the idea of Madness as a mechanical reward, but I'm concerned that 20 points of Sanity is too much.

I think personally I'd use a 20, since that would more closely replicate the granularity of BRP's percentile system. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
