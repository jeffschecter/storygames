You know how, with PTA, everybody says it's important that you make-sure everybody really loves the idea<br/>that you settle-on in the pitch session?  Fiasco doesn't need a great 'idea for a show'.  <br/>So don't linger on grasping-for that perfect idea.<br/><br/>2. You cooould intensely study the playset lists, trying to cherry-pick the 'best' items; or you can pick elements randomly.<br/>But.<br/>I think it's counterproductive to cherry-pick.  Because your 'perfect' setup will be too predictable.  If you understand too-well how all the elements fit-together, then the story will transpire too much like clockwork.   If you CAN'T PREDICT how all this is going to play out, you'll be pleasantly surprised when it progresses-into tidy clockwork, after all.<br/><br/>3. It doesn't matter if you can't see what the people across the table wrote on their cards.  As long as you understand how you fit-in with your Left and Right, you're ready to go.  At first, narrate stuff that mostly concerns you and your immediate seat-neighbors. <br/><br/>4.  Objects and Locations are only lamer than Relationships and Needs if you let them merely remain Objects and Locations. Bury a treasure or hang somebody at the "Hangman's Tree".  Do something with it, or else its a just a tree. <br/><br/>Getting-going:<br/><br/>5. A good-little-indie player will try to set-up other players to 'be awesome', right?  Wrong!  The problem is, that you then oblige the other players to wear the back-half of a horse costume you selected.   Whereas, If you just focus on 'your guy' and his petty interests and erratic behavior-- the other players will be free to take things where they desire, too.<br/><br/>6. Treat everything written-down as mere inspiration, like a tarot card.  Even those Port and Starboard relationship-ideas you're super-excited about as you begin-- will probably be no-more-than an approximation of what actually gets narrated.<br/>"It's written-down, so it's true" does not apply in Fiasco.  Nothing is true until it's said aloud in a scene.<br/><br/>7.  If your narration collides with another player's expectations-- about their own setup, even-- then they should seriously consider going-along with your version; unless it so thoroughly derails their understanding of their place in the story, that they literally CAN'T IMAGINE how to make your way work.  In which case, you need to defer to their version.<br/><br/>8. Don't worry if some setup elements never get used.  That just means so-much other stuff was in play, that you didn't need the extra story-fuel.<br/><br/>Resolution:<br/>9. Let's say I'm framing a scene poorly.  It's unclear what my character wants, what's at stake, what the point is.<br/>It's perfectly OK for somebody to just silently grab a black die &amp; then I narrate that 'something bad' happens: "Lightning strikes my guy."   Or-- a white die-- "Hey, I find a pot of gold!"    FIASCO LETS YOU 'RESOLVE' BEFORE (OR WITHOUT) SETTING STAKES.   Are 'lightning' and 'gold' even forms of 'Conflict'?  Good news: it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>10. "Lightning" and "a pot of gold" are hardly clever.  In fact, they are idiotic.  And that's fine.  Because the game doesn't depend on virtuoso Cool Scenes.   It depends on scene after scene building momentum into a doozy of a Fiasco.  Simple little scenes work fine.  (After the lightning strikes, somebody tries to pick my pocket, CUT! The pickpocket cuts a line of coke with my credit card and somebody sees my name on it, CUT!  The person who sees my name starts to exclaim that card doesn't belong to the pickpocket, but they sneeze and spill all the cocaine instead, CUT!)<br/><br/>11. Still stuck on a resolution?  Try this: Narrate something asinine. For example, after a black die: "Just as we're about to exchange the girl for the ransom, lightning strikes her dead"<br/><br/>"I shake my fist at the sky, and yell 'OMG?! WTF?!' at God.  I say 'Really, God? Lightning? Again? You are a petty and asinine God with poor impulse control!  I empty my revolver at the sky."  CUT.   It's not just the characters who are unpredictable.  The world itself can be erratic.  (Use this sparingly, tho.) Because\u2026.<br/><br/>12. My last couple examples are in danger of being Too Clever, too cute.  Better if the scenes just accumulate as a series of good and bad outcomes-- without all of them being absurdly gonzo (or impressive or poignant, even). The overall story will be impressive out of sheer complexity.  'Brutally funny' will take care of itself.  Don't 'force it' or things will degenerate into slap-happy silliness.  Which will feel yucky and desperate.  Have confidence.<br/><br/><br/>13.  I went to an Indie comic book convention today and among the lone wolf publishers selling hand-drawn, hand-bound, photocopied comics; there was a whole herd of Euro-Socialist SHEEP!  Their commie-comics were printed on the finest archival artbook paper and covers, thanks to government grants.  They paid airfare to NY with government money!  How is that Indie? How many people on Earth speak Finnish? How many convention-goers can read Norwegian comics?  If you're having trouble with Fiasco, maybe the reason is that it's an Indie game about the Independence of Un-dependent Americans! I bet you don't even own a handgun.  Yeah, maybe the way we live here is sick and wrong.  But at least I don't need to come crawling to the internet to ask how to be a Fiasco Fuck uP!  Yee haw.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266517/#Comment_266517" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-11T00:25:15+00:00" title="April 11, 2010 12:25AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.macrochan.org/view.php?u=ICSEIXOBDBUKALRPFCQUPCJX4TWQCGGU" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.macrochan.org/images/I/C/ICSEIXOBDBUKALRPFCQUPCJX4TWQCGGU.jpeg"/></a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266538/#Comment_266538" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-11T08:21:23+00:00" title="April 11, 2010  8:21AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I bookmarked this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Pidgeon" title="David Pidgeon"><img alt="David Pidgeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Pidgeon">David Pidgeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266581/#Comment_266581" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-11T19:26:28+00:00" title="April 11, 2010  7:26PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't even get my players to play Fiasco but you've just made me want to play it even more and...

But why limit yourself to narrating something stupid when you could be obvious, derivative, absurd, incomprehensible, or frankly repetitive? I mean that seriously. <i>Fiasco</i> especially seems to thrive on the obvious, and I've gotten good mileage out of subjecting a character to the exact same trouble that someone (maybe even the same guy) has already been in. "Gee, we're at the restaurant where I had the run-in with Fat Tony in scene 3? I guess you can have a run in with Fat Tony at the same restaurant. In fact, he's still trying to eat the same dinner, and when you see him, he's got a mean look on his face, like a man who will chew your face off if he doesn't get his past'e'fagioli toute freaking suite. Won't this be fun?" (The last part should be said in your best crazed Scoutmaster/The Computer voice.)<br/><br/>There are many shades of brown in the crap rainbow, and there's no reason not to stain your character's shoes with all of them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266749/#Comment_266749" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T14:45:05+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  2:45PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 13, 2010 9:12AM by Todd_L.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is from last weekend.  <br/><br/><i>Stats:<br/>1 hour of pizza-eating &amp; set-up; then 1:41 from first Scene to Aftermath.<br/>We jumped ahead to the Aftermath with 4 dice still on the table, because everything was wrapped up tidy.<br/>We = 3 comic book writers, an actor, a semi-willing girlfriend, and me as heavy-handed facilitator.<br/>This account is from memory-- with little embellishment, but some pruning.<br/>Turn-order is intact, indicated by dash--dash between paragraphs.</i><br/><br/>A BAG OF MICE<br/><br/>story by WG, GZ, CA, ET, JIT, and TL; <br/>after 'Fiasco' by Jason Morningstar<br/><br/><br/>Synopsis:<br/><br/><br/>HAL loses a late-night card game with RAY BLISTERS, who is a hangman by trade.<br/>Hal admits he doesn't have any money to pay up.  <br/>But Hal says he knows where to find a diamond wedding ring, as payment. <br/>Ray Blisters accepts the offer, and lets Hal sleep on his floor.<br/>--<br/><br/>The next morning, PHIL BLISTERS (brother of Ray), enlists Hal in a scheme to hike into Indian Country as 'Christian volunteers', and sell bibles to the Indians.<br/>The Indians have nothing to trade, but a bag of "rare jumping mice", which Phil accepts.  <br/>As the volunteers depart, the Indians use the bibles as kindling.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Back at home, Phil Blisters verbally abuses his brother Ray, calling him "Little Shit".  <br/>Hal orders Ray to sell the bag of mice to "the mice lady", MRS. EVELYN WEDGEWOOD.<br/>Ray grumbles and refuses to carry-out his brother's order.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Mrs. Evelyn Wedgewood demands a divorce from JUDGE ARTHUR WEDGEWOOD, in a house overflowing with caged mice, which race-around inside various gambling-apparatuses.  <br/>MOTHER WEDGEWOOD is recently-deceased, and Evelyn says Arthur should go back East when his Mother's remains are sent there.  <br/>Arthur refuses to leave.<br/><br/>Phil Blisters arrives and interrupts.  Phil Blisters is peddling 'Christian funeral and burial services'.   <br/>Arthur declines, denounces Christianity, advocates Science and Evolution and Mice. "Furthermore, we'll be sending Mother back East for burial. So fuck off." <br/>Phil Blisters then tries to sell them the bag of mice.  Arthur scoffs at Phil's mice.  <br/>Phil Blisters says his mice have more holy spirit than the Wedgewoods' godless mice. <br/>The Wedgewoods challenge Phil Blisters to a duel of mice, to determine whose mice are fittest, to be conducted at Mother Wedgewood's wake.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Later, Hal approaches Arthur Wedgewood.   As with Ray Blisters, Hal owes Arthur gambling debts; but can't pay. <br/>Hal offers to dig a grave and bury Mother Wedgewood, as payment.   Hal notes that free local burial will save the expense of shipping Mother back East.  <br/>Hal also points to decorative taxidermy-mice he has crafted for the Wedgewoods, as evidence of his skill as an embalmer.  They shake hands on the deal.  <br/>Arthur even advances Hal a little money for burial expenses.  <br/>Hal takes away the body and (with grotesque difficulty) gets the wedding ring off it.  <br/>Hal gives the ring to Ray Blisters as promised.  Ray realizes it came from a corpse. [Perhaps the finger is still in it?]<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>Hal takes the burial advance-money and gambles it at cards.  For once Hal wins more money.  Hal takes his winnings to the Blisters brothers.  <br/><br/>[Somewhere between the set-up and this point, it was established that MA BLISTERS owes gambling debts from lost bets on Evelyn Wedgewood's mice-games; <br/>so in his dual role as justice and bookie, Judge Wedgewood has jailed Ma Blisters for non-payment.]<br/><br/>Hal proposes that the Blisters brothers should take Hal's recent winnings and use them to pay Ma Blisters' debts, so she can be freed.  <br/>In exchange, Hal wants to use Ma Blisters' expertise in betting on mice, against the Indians.   <br/>The scheme is enacted, but it backfires horribly. <br/>Ma Blisters' expertise fails and Hal loses everything (including mule, boots, &amp; belt buckle) to the Indians.  <br/>It's a long sock-footed walk back from Indian Country.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>When Ma Blisters returns to her home, the social balance there has changed.  <br/>Previously, Phil Blisters was abusive to brother Ray.  But now Ma dotes on Ray and is wicked to Phil.   <br/>Phil tries to take credit for buying Ma out of jail; but Ray tells Ma that it was all Hal's idea, not Phil's.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Ray Blisters meets with Evelyn Wedgwood. We see they are lovers. <br/>In anticipation of her divorce, Ray proposes marriage to Evelyn, and she accepts the ring.  She recognizes it as Mother Wedgewood's.   She interrogates Ray about where he obtained the ring.  Ray stumbles for an answer, muttering something about a pawn shop.<br/>--<br/><br/>Evelyn Wedgewood interrogates her husband about his mother's ring, thinking Arthur must have secretly pawned it, to avoid splitting the proceeds with Evelyn.   <br/>Arthur denies having pawned it, and reverses the question; asking where she got the ring.  <br/>Now it's Evelyn's turn to stumble for an answer, claiming that Ma Blisters bought it in a pawn shop, and\u2026 umm\u2026 uh.  <br/>Arthur reclaims the wedding ring away from Evelyn, to her dismay.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Arthur brings the ring to the Blister home to question Ma Blisters about it.  Ray answers the door instead.  <br/>Seeing the ring, Ray assumes Arthur is aware of Ray's affair with Evelyn.  <br/>As Ray confesses to the affair, Phil appears and shoots Arthur in the head. <br/>Phil barks at Ray, "Don't say I never did nuthin' for you, you Little Shit!" <br/><br/>--<br/>FADE OUT AND FADE IN<br/><br/>At Mother Wedgewood's wake, we see Evelyn Wedgewood tending her husband Arthur with maternalistic love.  <br/>Arthur is in a wheelchair with a bandage wrapped around his head.  <br/>Phil Blisters' holy Indian jumping mice are competing against the Wedgewood's eastern-Massachusetts atheist woodland mice.   <br/>The Wedgewoods are losing badly.  Betting on the Blisters' mice, Hal is winning big.  <br/>Arthur's head injury has made him loopy, blurting the word "Pancakes!" in wild-eyed excitement.  <br/>Having lost everything, Arthur nonsensically cheers, "Hoorray! Double or nothing!"<br/><br/>Finally, Hal says there's only one thing Arthur Wedgwood has left to offer: his forgiveness.   <br/>Hal admits that he stole the wedding ring from Mother Wedgewood's corpse, and used it to pay gambling debts. <br/>Hal says that, if he wins one final bet-- Arthur must then forgive the ring theft.   <br/>In a moment of lucidity, Judge Wedgewood's hard-eyed old self is back, <br/>"I'm the Judge in this damn town, you son of a bitch; and if my mouse wins you'll hang by the neck like the grave-robbing ghoul you are!"   <br/>Hal loses.  "Pancakes!" declares Arthur.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>As the wake continues, Phil Blisters addresses the assembled community, and uses his best bible-sales pitch to argue that he should be made the new Judge <br/>"...in light of Arthur's infirm condition, and personal conflict of interest in the corpse-robbing case of <i>Mother Wedgewood et al. vs. Hal.</i> and so forth..."<br/>The town agrees.  Judge Blisters is now presiding.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Evelyn approaches Hal in jail and notes that, although Hal won big on the mice, he won't be able to spend it if he's hanged.  <br/>If Hal agrees to trade his wealth for his freedom, she offers to use her influence to help.  Hal agrees.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Evelyn tells Ray Blisters to ask Judge Phil to go easy on Hal in court.<br/>Phil agrees, on one condition: Ray must convince Ma Blisters that Phil is not a bad son after-all.  <br/>Ray succeeds in convincing Ma.<br/>Hal is freed and pays Evelyn.<br/>Ray and Evelyn are wed. <br/>Ray slides the ring on her finger, and they have kinky double-headed-noose sex in front of their mindless ward Arthur.  <br/>Arthur claps and says "Pancakes!"<br/><br/>-- <br/><br/>They all live happily ever after, until:<br/><br/>The rest of Hal's life is one long gambler's losing streak.  Bookies take one of his feet.  He is last seen serving under General Custer.<br/><br/>Judge P. Blisters goes far. He becomes Governor Blisters. He eventually opens the House of Blisters; a casino and house of ill repute.  A statue of him stands in Blisterville, even today.<br/><br/>Ray Blisters suffers hangman's-remorse, so he can't embrace atheism. So he loses Evelyn.  Ma Blisters can only love one son at a time, and it's never Ray again.<br/>Ray ends-up berated and broken, working at the House of Blisters.<br/><br/>Evelyn resumes her mouse-breeding and leads a full life of progressive scientific living, temperance, suffrage, constitutionals, enemas, modern dance, and atheism.<br/><br/>Despite his diminished capacities, Arthur is drafted into the Indian wars, where the Indians 'go <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Man_Called_Horse_%281970_film%29" rel="nofollow">A Man Called Horse</a> on him', but eventually worship him as a God-- a fire god.  He survives years of ritual burning over bible-fires, to eventually pen this entire account in his memoirs, which are only found and published after he inadvertently falls off a cliff.<br/><br/>Historians question the reliability of Arthur's recollections.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266836/#Comment_266836" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T04:32:55+00:00" title="April 13, 2010  4:32AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 13, 2010 4:33AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is powerful crazy, Todd.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266850/#Comment_266850" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T08:13:03+00:00" title="April 13, 2010  8:13AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="image" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/twoflower/pic/0002ppdt"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266851/#Comment_266851" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T08:15:57+00:00" title="April 13, 2010  8:15AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it is worth, I totally support what Todd is saying here, although we disagree a little about <a href="/forums/search?Search=%235&amp;Mode=like">#5</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266862/#Comment_266862" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T09:27:06+00:00" title="April 13, 2010  9:27AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't tell... did you enjoy this game?
