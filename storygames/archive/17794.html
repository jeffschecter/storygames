Hope I can find some players!!!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Doctor Who and the Orient Express<br/><br/>The 11th Doctor, Amy and Rory are safely back on the Tardis after a particularly dangerous encounter with the Daleks. All is safe as they fly through space and time. <br/><br/>\u201cDoctor, do you think we could go somewhere a little safer next time?\u201d Asks Rory.<br/><br/>\u201cSafe? Certainly! Victorian\u2019s Diamond Jubilee? The opening of the Crystal Palace? Chelsea 1966? Oh I know\u2026 The Orient Express. Yes!\u201d<br/><br/>Rory and Amy look at one another and tentatively say \u201cOkay\u2026\u201d<br/><br/>Minutes later a familiar whoosh, whoosh sound is heard in the baggage compartment of the famed train. A newspaper lies on the porter\u2019s desk that reads \u201cBelgrade 19 February, 1923\u201d. Our heroes come out dressed in appropriate clothing. Amelia Pond as a flapper, just think of the possibilities\u2026<br/><br/>AND SO BEGINS ANOTHER ADVENTURE OF DOCTOR WHO<br/><br/>This is a game about an unrecorded adventure of the Matt Smith Doctor that will be run as a play by forum game for 4 to 8 players. In it you will create a Doctor Who story and probably save the world. The alien menace is unknown at the start of the game. The players will make it up as they play.<br/><br/>Unlike in many role play games, our players are not limited to saying what their character does. Each turn the players will describe what all of the players do in a scene. The means everyone is in effect the Doctor, the companions and everyone else in the game. Each player champions one character but in the end the goal is to tell a good story rather than to make your character win. This is a competitive game though. As player make stuff up they earn victory points.  At the end of the show the player with the highest total wins. <br/><br/>THE OTHER CHARACTERS ON THE TRAIN<br/><br/>Hans Grubber \u2013 The Porter<br/>Janos Nagy \u2013 The Conductor<br/>Dagny Mislovich \u2013 Female server in the Dining Car<br/>Col Bluster \u2013 British officer heading East.<br/>Lady Astor \u2013 British Lady on vacation.<br/>Madge \u2013 Lady Astor\u2019s servant and companion<br/>Baron Von Kleist \u2013 A Prussian noble and former army officer.<br/>Ed Becket \u2013 An American Ex Pat, probably a writer or poet.<br/>Vicki Lane \u2013 A plucky young British socialite.<br/>Monsieur Duval \u2013 A French Diplomat.<br/>Pasha Ali Khan \u2013 A Turkish dignitary.<br/>A Mysterious Stranger \u2013 Wrapped in a travelling cloak. No one knows them. Suspicious huh?<br/><br/>THE TRAIN<br/><br/>The entire game takes place on the train as it travels from Belgrade Yugoslavia to Istanbul Turkey.  The train consists of only a few locations.<br/><br/>The engine \u2013 No one is allowed there.<br/>The baggage carriage \u2013 Where the Tardis lands.<br/>The dining car \u2013 Which has a large common room.<br/>Passenger cars \u2013 Each passenger has their own sleeper compartment.<br/>The caboose \u2013 The conductor\u2019s office<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY THE GAME<br/><br/>It is helpful to imagine this game like a card game. There are location cards laid out in a row on a table. Each character card sits next to the location they are in. On the side of the table are a series of plot cards the guide the game through a story. Lastly each player has a hand of 5 action cards that they use to make things happen.<br/><br/>Each turn a player lays down an action card and makes up a little story about what happens in that scene. In this game you will do this by writing a description of a scene (please keep these to five paragraphs or less). If the description is fun players won\u2019t challenge it but if you put words into their character\u2019s mouth that they don\u2019t like they may challenge the scene. To challenge a player jumps in and says \u201cwhat really happened\u201d. A simple die roll determines what action happens. Each player gets one challenge a turn. It is likely that there will be few dice rolls in the game until the story moves to a climax.<br/><br/>If no one challenges an action, the 1st player wins the turn and gets the victory points from the action card. If a challenger wins, they get the victory points.  After the turn the first player gets a new action card so players always have 5 cards. <br/><br/>Instead of playing an action card, the active player may instead pick a plot card and use it as the inspiration for their turn. Plot cards start off giving few victory points but they go up as the story progresses. They are about pivotal points so players will likely fight over who wins them.  The game ends when the last plot card is played. <br/><br/>Turns end with people moving their character to new locations, or not. It this game though we will ignore movement. The people present are the ones you say are present. <br/><br/>After the end of the game each player gets to make one last statement about what happens to their character after the game ends. <br/><br/>Those are the rules. They are pretty simple. The action or plot card tells you what the scene is about. You make up the details. All you need to do is make it fun!<br/><br/>THE ACTION DECK<br/><br/>Construction montage 1vp<br/>Pregnant pause 3vp<br/>Awkward silence 3<br/>Suspense 2<br/>Lie cheat and steal 2<br/>Betray 3<br/>Look who\u2019s in trouble 2<br/>Clue 2<br/>I\u2019ll be right back 2<br/>Innuendo 3<br/>Insult 2<br/>Flirt 3<br/> Eureka 2<br/>I\u2019ve got a plan 1<br/>Charge 1<br/>Sneak 1<br/>Rest and recover 1<br/>Intimidate 1<br/>Question 2<br/>Follow 2<br/>Bad luck 1<br/>Overhear 1<br/>Capture 2<br/>Chase 2<br/> Story recap 3<br/>Run away 1<br/>Shoot down 1<br/>Ambush 1 Make a friend 2<br/> Cover up/set up 1<br/>Wild and crazy 2<br/>Secret 2<br/> Coward 2 <br/>Be brave 1<br/>Lover boy 2<br/>Get even 3<br/>Trick 3<br/>Say yes 1<br/>No way 1<br/>Argue 2<br/>First to die 3<br/>Looking good 2<br/>Evade 2<br/>Hide 2<br/>Relentless 1<br/>Guilt trip 3<br/>Shame on you 3<br/>I\u2019m going to kill you 1<br/>In the nick of time 1<br/>Challenge 1<br/>Cocky 1<br/>Off into the sun set 1<br/><br/>I will deal out the cards by rolling a d6 and counting through the deck. As cards are taken I will mark them out so eventually the action deck will be used up and players will be forced to pick the plot cards to take a turn.  You hand of cards will be secret till you play them.<br/><br/>THE PLOT DECK<br/><br/>1vp\t How does the Doctor and his Companions blend in with the other passengers?<br/>2vp\t Something odd happens that everyone notices. What is it?<br/>4vp\tHow does the Doctor take the lead in the investigation? Or prevent someone else from taking command if he is already leading?<br/>8vp\tThe baddie is revealed. Who is it? What are they?<br/>12vp\tHow does the Doctor save the day?<br/><br/>A FEW MINOR RULES<br/><br/>It goes without saying that the Doctor, Amy and Rory cannot die in the game. Everyone else though is fair game. If you character is killed, you are not out of the game. You continue to make up scenes as before \u2013 just through other characters. <br/><br/>As you can tell, this is a story telling game so the players have a lot of power to make things happen. You may also have noticed that there is no game master. This is true, but only a little. I will act as your game host. My job is to help keep the game moving but in the end I have only as much power as the rest of you have. <br/><br/>The turn order will be preset so players may jump in and make a resolve turns quickly. Please allow a day to pass between actions to give everyone a chance to make a challenge. If a challenge is made it is okay to jump in immediately if you want to challenge challenges. In this way we can move through turns very quickly. It is possible the game will only take a couple of weeks to play. <br/><br/>I will roll for replacement cards and send them out to you in a private email.<br/><br/>HOW DICE ROLLS ARE DONE<br/><br/>Challenges are resolved using a single die roll. I am going to trust your honor to tell the truth what you die roll is. The challenging player rolls 1d6. If they roll an even number, they win. If they roll an odd number the person they are challenging wins. <br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
