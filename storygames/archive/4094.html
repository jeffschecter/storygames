The "somewhere" depends on the genre, and doesn't really affect the underlying idea. Basically, in the course of escaping and finding out who they are, the PCs will probably exhibit some tendencies. For instance, one character may immediately try to con the gaurd into letting them out. Another may fashion a makeshift lockpick. This would be read in game as the character subconsciously trying what feels most comfortable first.<br/><br/>Whatever they do, that's what their skills are. Each character would have a set number of point buy points that the GM would assign every time an action is taken, until they're out of points. Preferably the escape scenario is setup to give everyone plenty of opportunities, and a chance to find files about themselves, represented out of game by the character sheets.<br/><br/>Has anyone tried something like this before?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91470/#Comment_91470" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-29T20:04:35+00:00" title="August 29, 2007  8:04PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only game I've ever played which involved amnesia / identity confusion mechanics is Fred Hick's still-in-development "Schizonauts," which is capital-A Awesome.

Actually, the first third of the game consisted of the players asking him yes or no questions, to which he <i>always</i> said yes, though he sometimes elaborated on them or added complications.  We weren't told that he would always aswer yes ahead of time, so it took a little while to figure out (and phrasing the question became important).  The PCs started out as amnesiacs but figured stuff out about themselves by the players asking questions.  Once everyone had some stuff established about themselves, the game resumed normal OTE mechanics and built on what we had established.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91843/#Comment_91843" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T13:47:40+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  1:47PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James,<br/>\n<br/>\nThe method, basically, is somewhat like Mr. Laws method, except that I actually encourage the illusion of extant character sheets and such by having a GM screen or something (I recommend a clipboard, actually). Further I recommed actually only saying yes to things about two-thirds of the time. Otherwise, I've found, people catch on too quickly. That, or you have to do as Laws did, and make up additional information on the spot to make it seem like you're not just going with the player's ideas. There's a few more hints in the game about this sort of thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I really try to focus on, however, are the elements that are presented to the players - who wake up in an odd prison where they cannot see or interrogate their jailors. They are meant to be somewhat generic to North Americans, yet things that I think will provoke people to make assumptions. Not specific assumptions, but assumptions at random depending on the player. In fact one player, after playing, said that the game was like a Rorsach test for gamers, in that they tended to see what they wanted to see, and this gives you some insight into them as a player. <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, the No Press Anthology has 8 games in it! That's $2.50 a game! At that price, even if not long, these games are a steal. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91855/#Comment_91855" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T14:13:13+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  2:13PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>They are meant to be somewhat generic to North Americans, yet things that I think will provoke people to make assumptions.

Can you perhaps give an example?\n<blockquote>BTW, the No Press Anthology has 8 games in it! That's $2.50 a game!

As your character did something, the GM would make a check mark on a record sheet indicating which class your character would be.  If you try to sneak along the ridge to ambush the goblins, place a check mark by Thief.  If you pick up a sword in combat, put a minus by Cleric and Magic-User.  If you study the magic book in the adventure, place a check mark by Magic-User for each hour you study.  Once you reach 0 XP (you started at -500), the GM looks at your sheet and says something like, "You've been behaving pretty much like a chaotic-good fighter or ranger.  Does that sound right?"  And you go, "Yeah, and I think this guy is going to turn out to be a ranger."  Boom.  You're now playing a level 1 ranger.<br/><br/>Waking up as an amnesiac character... if you've played any computer RPGs over the past decade, you'd recognize that as the go-to story cliche.
