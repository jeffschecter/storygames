This game checks a lot of boxes for me:  It has very clear mechanical procedures for determining events.  It doesn't require the GM to arbitrarily set difficulties.  It has a cool, scene-length economy that decides the result of a conflict at a macro level driven by all of the action and stunting in the individual sub-conflicts.  It seems like it will play like a cool cooperative boardgame like <i>Pandemic</i> or <i>Castle Panic</i>.  And it's written by John Harper, whose <i>Agon</i> and <i>Lady Blackbird</i> I've really enjoyed.<br/><br/>But in preparation for running a one-shot this Saturday I did a brief "lonely fun" walk-through last night and I realized that at some fundamental level <i>I don't get this game!</i>  I need your help.<br/><br/>Here's the core of it:  There don't seem to be any meaningful decisions for the players in Danger Patrol.  <br/><br/>I've come to really think about game mechanics in terms of the choices they force players to make.  D&amp;D is all about risk assessment, knowing when to retreat and deciding how many resources of various kinds to expend on overcoming challenges.  Sorcerer is all about deciding how badly you want things and how much you are willing to risk your Humanity in order to get them.  (In fact, I suspect that it's reading Sorcerer &amp; Soul that really got me into this way of assessing games.)  Most other games I've enjoyed -- from Tunnels &amp; Trolls to Bliss Stage -- seem to fall somewhere near one of these two poles in terms of risking either Material or Self to obtain objectives.<br/><br/>But in Danger Patrol the only real tactical choices seem to be:<br/><br/>1) How much should the PCs disperse themselves amongst the Threats?  It seems like a pretty safe strategy is to just double-team the threats 2:1; this seems like it more-or-less guarantees that each marked Threat will get wrapped up in a round.  Certainly in my one test run it did.  The downside, presumably is setting for a perhaps-more-conservative rate of Threat reduction and thus perhaps greater increase of overall Danger.<br/><br/>2) When should PCs take Recovery actions in lieu of their regular turn? <br/><br/>But neither of these seems to embody an interesting tension -- either tactically or in terms of the narrative.  The choices seem too simple and one-dimensional to offer much tactical satisfaction.  And there aren't really any narrative priorities for them to be integrated into.<br/><br/>Why does any of this matter?  Well, it matters because in my "lonely fun" situation I was taken aback to find that I didn't have any tools for making decisions about which Threats the PCs should apply themselves to.  I ended up with what I consider the worst decision:  <i>If I constantly double team the Threats I believe I am more likely to win, but I'll feel bad that I am exploiting a weakness in the rules in some way.  But if I don't exploit that weakness I don't feel there is any other hook on which to hang a decision and play seems slightly aimless.</i><br/><br/>It may well be that in real play, with real players, this game is going to run just fine.  The players I play with are mostly pretty Sim-focused, fiction-first types and will probably engage the Threats based on purely in-fiction parameters and ask me to remind them which dice to roll round on round.  <i>But I'll know that the game doesn't "make sense" to me.</i><br/><br/>So.  Am I over-thinking this?  Am I just someone whose aesthetic priorities don't line up with Danger Patrol?  Or am I overlooking something which would help my brain unlock this game and start to grok it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399042/#Comment_399042" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-28T15:19:57+00:00" title="November 28, 2012  3:19PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In your <i>Lonely Fun</i> walk-through, how many "characters" did you have in relation to total Threats? What Strengths and Weaknesses did the Threats have?<br/><br/>I've run Danger Patrol several times, in all three iterations of the rules. With Pocket Danger Patrol, yeah, it's kinda gears specifically towards hard-hitting action, not so much for risk assessment. But that really kind of captures the feel of the pulp genre. Everything looks easy-peasy going in...until a bunch of Danger gets rolled.<br/><br/>To date, in the ten or twelve times I've run Pocket Danger Patrol, one action scene has always lasted the entire session, and in most cases, the players got creamed at the very end. They pretty much ignored the option for Recovery, but it's always been a laugh-riot of actiony fun.<br/><br/>The thing that really has kept characters from steamrolling the Threats have been the Strengths and Weaknesses, as well as the descriptions of the Threats themselves. I always try to make sure to have the players describe what they're doing before they gather up their dice from abilities. I don't want them to automatically pick their highest abilities, and so after listening to their description, I can police it and say "So, how exactly are you defusing the bomb with your Battle ability again?"<br/><br/>Also, choosing to add Countdowns to certain Threats (particularly 1-point countdowns), or having Complications at the very beginning can help.<br/><br/>I've also brought back staged threats from the old rules - some Threats are protected by others, and can't be touched unless the guarding Threats are taken out first.<br/><br/>If, somehow, this still seems too easy, here's a couple of my house rules:<br/>Major Threats (big bosses, super battleships, etc.) have Strengths, but they let them IGNORE certain abilities ("Sorry, it's immune to Battle...it's just too big to be bothered by your weeny guns!").<br/>Complications, instead of adding Threat dice to your roll, automatically add 1 Danger to your result, no matter what you roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert%20Ahrens" title="Robert Ahrens"><img alt="Robert Ahrens" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/664/n4GHDX832T7IU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert%20Ahrens">Robert Ahrens</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399045/#Comment_399045" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-28T15:51:55+00:00" title="November 28, 2012  3:51PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, unh, Gremlin. <br/><br/>(What happened to the old feature where you could hover someone's username and see their real name?  Is that gone now?)<br/><br/>So here's the setup I had for the run-through:  I decided I wanted a pulp Cthulhu-y feel for this game; that will fit with the aesthetic priorities of my group, I believe.  So I tweaked the lists of Styles and Roles and kept everything else the same.  I decided to go with two PCs in order to keep the game from running long.  That meant I started off with 5 Threats.  I didn't use any timer or protected Threats.<br/><br/><i>Jaws</i> was on TV while I was playing.  That rubber shark always scares the bejeezus out of me so I decided to incorporate some of that flavor into the setup:  Dagon cultists have captured a luxury "yacht" (one of those four-tiered things with a private spa and three swimming pools) and taken it deep out to sea to a sacred site, above a reef populated by Deep Ones who also worship Dagon.  They have begun a blood sacrifice to the nameless gods which has summoned up a terrible megalodon-style uber-shark from the depths.  Oh, and the yacht is on fire thanks to an unsuccessful breakaway attempt by the socialites on the yacht.<br/><br/>Speeding to the rescue in their cigarette boat are our two PCs:<br/><br/><b>Maude Minervois, Ghostly Daredevil</b><br/>Daring 2   Power 0   Heart 1   Weird 2<br/>Action 2   Cunning 2   Battle 1   Science 0<br/>Ectoplasmic projection 2d8<br/>Deeds of derring do 2d8<br/><br/><b>Mickey Mesopotamia, Two-Fisted Archaeologist</b><br/>Daring 1   Power 2   Heart 2   Weird 0<br/>Action 1   Cunning 1   Battle 2   Science 1<br/>Pearl-handled six-shooters 2d8<br/>Right place right time 2d8<br/><br/>I broke the Threats out as follows (and rolled up their Strengths &amp; Weaknesses on the chart):<br/><br/><b>Dagon Cultists</b><br/>Strong against Science<br/>Weak against Battle, Action<br/><br/><b>Degenerate High Priest of Dagon</b><br/>Strong against Daring<br/>Weak against Weird, Battle<br/><br/><b>A raging fire</b><br/>Strong against Power<br/>Weak against Nothing!<br/><br/><b>A mutated mega-shark</b><br/>Strong against Action, Heart<br/>Weak against Heart, Power<br/><br/><b>Deep One mariners riding things which were not bats and not porpoises, yet terribly suggestive of both</b><br/>Strong against Battle<br/>Weak against Power<br/><br/>Additionally, the following Complications came up during play:<br/><br/>The Eye of Atomato (used by the Cultists to bind Maude's ectoplasmic form)<br/><br/>A Yowling Maw of Spectral Energy (opened by the Priest's ritual)<br/><br/>Hungry Spectral Hounds (which emerged from said Maw)<br/><br/>Blood in the Water (after Mickey got gashed by a Deep One's spearhead)<br/><br/>The "anchor" (a semi-sentient carnivorous seaweed bio-weapon the Deep Ones sprayed Mickey with)<br/><br/>All in all the PCs took out 4 of the 5 Threats, leaving only the fire.  Maude tried to shut down the Complications which were dogging her but got Taken Out before she could do so.  The Danger level was only 5 (out of 10 before the scenario ends). <br/><br/>I felt like the Color was more-or-less what I was looking for but the sense of excitement was lacking.  Obviously that's in part due to solo "play".  <br/><br/>Finally, an observation:  Gremlin, I think you've re-phrased a lot of my misgivings in terms of what will make play more challenging for the PCs.  That's not really my concern.  In fact, based on my run-through (and your observation about PCs losing most of the conflicts) it's low on my list of worries.<br/><br/>My concern is not really a GM's concern at all -- it's a player's concern:  I don't think I would enjoy <i>playing</i> Danger Patrol because I wouldn't feel like any of the decisions I made had any impact on the outcome of play.  Or, worse, I'd be tempted to exploit what I see as "system weakness" by ganging up on Threats and making sure we shut them down, which would feel weirdly ... uh ... munchkinesque.<br/><br/>Strangely enough, the folks I play with don't really think about systems this way and would/will probably just enjoy engaging the fiction, making up great color and bouncing some dice.  It won't be a problem for them.  But I'll worry, you know?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399049/#Comment_399049" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-28T16:10:03+00:00" title="November 28, 2012  4:10PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 28, 2012 4:13PM by J_Walton.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Robert! (edit cross-posted)<br/><br/>I've never found the challenges in Danger Patrol to be too easy. IME, it can be tactically loose because the danger dice introduce new complications all the time that can disrupt the most well-considered plans, but only in rare cases did it feel like it didn't matter which threat I attempted next. There's almost always some light tactical play (though not super heavy).<br/><br/>The use of timers and different consequences for different threats definitely helps. Like if there's a bomb that will destroy the universe and a car crashing into a baby carriage, it might be tough to decide which to save first (after all, this is pulp!) but the consequences are definitely different. And if the bomb has a (2) and the baby has a (1), then it's baby first every time, yeah?<br/><br/>P.S. Players often team-up against the most dire threat of the moment, but this was never weird, IME.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert%20Ahrens" title="Robert Ahrens"><img alt="Robert Ahrens" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/664/n4GHDX832T7IU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert%20Ahrens">Robert Ahrens</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399050/#Comment_399050" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-28T16:28:07+00:00" title="November 28, 2012  4:28PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, JayWalt.

How do these elements "move across" mechanical representation (as danger dice riding on partially related Threats, or possibly being written into newly created Complications)?<br/><br/>I see I've really given everyone the impression that I'm worried that Danager Patrol is "too easy"!

Like, if there's a universe-destroying time bomb and the characters fail to stop it... then the universe is destroyed, or may be in the process of being destroyed, or the chars may have to go back in time and stop the universe from being destroyed, etc. The consequences for that are different than what happens if the Red Apes run rampant, which naturally means players prefer some fictional outcomes to others and act accordingly, whether that's mechanically incentivized or not.<br/><br/>Does that help or are we still talking about different things?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert%20Ahrens" title="Robert Ahrens"><img alt="Robert Ahrens" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/664/n4GHDX832T7IU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert%20Ahrens">Robert Ahrens</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399168/#Comment_399168" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-29T15:54:44+00:00" title="November 29, 2012  3:54PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting.  JW, I think what you've helped me grasp is that I've been too dismissive of the fictional content of Danger Patrol.<br/><br/>Really, language like "Choose one of the threats on the board and say what your hero does to stop it," had me thinking that it was very much decide an ability you want to use / narrate using it / roll all your dice / did you win?  You can imagine this playing out in say an SGB session where the context is kind of, <i>well, obviously I'm supposed to narrate using my highest rated abilities all the time, right?</i> <br/><br/>But if we put the fiction first and focus on building that up and making it awesome then obviously play will be better and the game will develop more of a feel of flow too.  Self-evident, and yet I had to be clubbed over the head with it.<br/><br/>As to the fictional consequences of threats ... interesting.  You know, I've only read the Pocket version of the game and that explicitly doesn't say very much about the consequences of losing other than, "If the threats win, the next action scene is more desperate."  I thought a bit about scene-level stakes but I hadn't really thought about what's at stake on a threat-by-threat level and how that has an impact.<br/><br/>So maybe my threats in the above game shouldn't have been<br/><br/>the cultists<br/>the high priest<br/>the fire<br/>the mega-shark<br/>the deep ones<br/><br/>but instead<br/><br/>the cultists are sacrificing all the civilians on the boat<br/>the high priest is opening a portal to another realm<br/>the fire is consuming the boat and will make it sink<br/>the mega-shark is becoming manifest in our reality<br/>the deep-ones are trying to take you prisoner (???)<br/><br/>Right?  Something like that?  Because now resolving a threat has an impact.  You can save the hostages and stop the boat from sinking but still lose the scene and discover that the high priest has opened a portal to another realm and the mega-shark is loose.  <br/><br/>Is it too rigid to apply this kind of thinking to all the Threats?  Should it just be some of them?  Maybe just the timer threats?  Or should I go into the scene playing it loose and discover the consequences from the fiction that gets created? <br/><br/>Sorry if I'm still being dense/hard of learnin' here.  I appreciate your helping me work this through.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/>R.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399197/#Comment_399197" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-29T21:51:00+00:00" title="November 29, 2012  9:51PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2012 9:51PM by J_Walton.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, yes, yes, that's much more like it.

I'm working on some stuff in that direction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399236/#Comment_399236" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-30T10:12:49+00:00" title="November 30, 2012 10:12AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 30, 2012 10:14AM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>but instead<br/><br/>the cultists are sacrificing all the civilians on the boat<br/>the high priest is opening a portal to another realm<br/>the fire is consuming the boat and will make it sink<br/>the mega-shark is becoming manifest in our reality<br/>the deep-ones are trying to take you prisoner (???)<br/></blockquote>\nWith this setup, it seems like there would be timers on all of the threats, which I personally wouldn't want to deal with. I haven't played the Pocket version, but I've played the standard DP a couple times now, so maybe my setup doesn't line up with the pocket version's suggested setup, but this is what I would do.<br/><br/>I'd just put a timer on the portal opening and the fire. I would say the mega-shark is a disaster caused by not stopping the portal from opening. I wouldn't put a timer on the sacrifices - rather each turn the cultists are not engaged with, some people are sacrificed. I would have the deep ones would only emerge once the fire is put out or once the mega-shark is fully summoned.<br/><br/>I love the setup you came up with, by the way!<br/><br/>PS: What do you think would happen if the fire isn't put out? Is the fire a threat to everyone, including the bad guys? What about civilians stealing the hero's cigarette boat? Just things to think about. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kaptainkobold" title="kaptainkobold"><img alt="kaptainkobold" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kaptainkobold">kaptainkobold</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413963/#Comment_413963" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-12T05:02:10+00:00" title="May 12, 2013  5:02AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            " PDP is a really terse little thing and it doesn't help you out much.

I appreciate that they can be just colour, but I can't help feeling that choosing, for example, a Ghostly Daredevil ought to make some physical difference to the game.<br/><br/>The best I've come up with so far is that each Role and Style dictates where two of your (total of) ten levels go; your choice affects your stats (or 40% of them). So, for example, A Commando automatically has 1 in Action and 1 in Battle, say, whilst a Psychic has 1 in heart and 1 in Weird. But I never got very far with that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
