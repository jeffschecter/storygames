Divide the tokens you have in a couple of scenes/encounters. Think about how each encounter leads to the next and what the finale encounter will be. Come up with a couple of fun NPCs, but drop them when the PC do something else or if they think up other interesting NPCs.<br/><br/>A Strength can end your Big Finale(tm) in an instant so think up also the next mission.<br/><br/>Don't hold back. Use the Ability of the Aliens whenever you can. Start of with a High AA, 7 or 8. <br/><br/>Follow your players wherever they want to go.<br/><br/>Have fun!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IvanHo" title="IvanHo"><img alt="IvanHo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IvanHo">IvanHo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255874/#Comment_255874" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-10T00:38:06+00:00" title="February 10, 2010 12:38AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Use a map.

I don't know how well I can actually do this. I want to make sure and understand the setting but I get pretty self conscious about describing detail and creating mood. I don't really get into character either, I'm almost always playing in the third person, so creating credibility and immersing them in the story is going to be tough. I just don't want to come off cheesy on one hand or apathetic and dull on the other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255980/#Comment_255980" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-10T11:25:55+00:00" title="February 10, 2010 11:25AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The standard strategy in roleplaying NPCs in 3:16 seems to be to get comedic in a dark vein from the start by satirizing the militant fascism that surrounds the player characters - not so much as to make light of the fiction, but enough to make it obvious from the start that the characters are in a horrible, horrible situation. For example, having a NPC officer give the PC unit their orders is a typical tack. You as the GM get to choose the nature of this NPC, and can pretty much determine the color of the game by that choice. Is he a true believer? Is he a cynical opportunist? Is he a brainless, shouting macho? Whatever he is, just pick a simple character trait and try to get that over at first. You can always add depth later, as the characters have had a chance to react to the superficial first impression.<br/><br/>Many actual plays I've read about this game read a bit like <i>Paranoia</i> in the fine detail of how the fiction is ran. For example, the soldiers get their awards and decorations from a wall dispenser in a stark parody of empty military ritual. How far you get into this sort of thing should probably be determined by the direction of the campaign in general; if the players are obviously sceptical and dismissive of the military institution, then you might do well to introduce sympathetic characters and good reasons for them to support the system, while if the players commit to their roles in the military machine, then your task might be to introduce fine detail that casts suspicions on the values and justifications of the bureaucracy the PCs belong in. It's business as usual in this regard - engage the player characters by challenging the roles and values they've chosen.<br/><br/>From what I've seen, it's typical of <i>3:16</i> that the PCs begin the game with a very narrow and biased view on their world, but then this view starts to widen as the characters progress in the ranks and get more responsibility - they get to see how the decisions are made, who makes them and why. You'll probably do well as the GM to play this sort of thing close to the vest at first, as folks seem to get good mileage out of revealing detail with time instead of all at once. When I've played, the common squad-level soldier has known little except the squad room, recreation areas, the loading bays, the shuttles and planetary surfaces they fight their war on. Introducing views on how the officers and the high command see it all carries heavy thematic weight in this set-up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255984/#Comment_255984" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-10T11:41:09+00:00" title="February 10, 2010 11:41AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2010 11:43AM by John_Harper.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero has hit the nail on the head.<br/><br/>Read the book closely, and really think about what Gregor is saying.

Watch <i>Aliens</i> and <i>Starship Troopers</i> and read <i>Armor</i> to fill your head with tropes and imagery for details in play.<br/><br/>Start with a bang. Have the Lieutenant give the briefing over the comms in the dropship on the way to the planet. Open the pod doors and assault them with alien war immediately. Give them a chance to be ass-kicking space marines right away (which is what they think they've signed up for, probably). Hit them with the Paranoia stuff and crazy military satire after the first engagement, not before.<br/><br/>(Although giving the Sergeant secret orders right off the bat is not a bad idea)<br/><br/>Play your NPCs, cover everything in military/sci-fi details, and give them a little down time here and there to explore, chat in character, and get into trouble.<br/><br/>I usually introduce a rival squad early on that thinks they're the most badass and tells the PC squad that they suck and are pansies.

In 3:16, events in the mission are catalysts that create friction (or perhaps bonding) between members of the squad.<br/><br/>For 3:16, and other military-themed, squad-centered RPGs I run (like Godlike), the mission is not a story, nor is it a plot. It is just that, a mission to be accomplished - take Hill 317 and hold it until relieved. I think about the enemy forces and what they will do, but I don't know how it's going to go. When the two sides engage, we'll find out who wins once the dice stop rolling. It's during the battle that little things can happen that highlight who the characters are and what they are about ("character is who you are in the dark"). The players need to understand this - they're the ones who are going to bring the drama between their characters. You are going to bring the pain as the GM by throwing enemies at them, but that's just a firefight. If the players don't try to push each other's buttons as well there's only so much that'll come out of things.<br/><br/>With 3:16 in particular, I set off story-bombs on the characters and just roll with what they do. I don't care if someone uses a Strength to shut it down right there or not - using Strengths is what the game is about. A character using a Strength to get out of a tough spot (again "character is who you are in the dark") is showing us who they are. Mechanically it's beneficial to everyone and that character in particular. But pushing the players to the point where they think it's necessary to use a Strength (or a Weakness), that's where you can get creative. For me, the easiest way to push them is to just be merciless with the aliens. When I run, 3:16, I try to be dispassionate and not care if the characters live or die. If I go by the rules, the PCs have plenty of ways to avoid getting smoked, so I try to smoke 'em.<br/><br/>Here's an example of a planet and encounter structure I like to use when I run 3:16 at cons (note that were I running a campaign I'd be just rolling up planets randomly of course):<br/><br/>First, a hint of backstory that the PC may or may not find out about but I'm not worried about it. Caravaggio is a radioactive wasteland that was once a thriving human colony. They rebelled, the Expeditionary force sent the 2:16, the 2:16 went rogue, now they're the enemy. They get the Suicide alien ability, since they know what the 3:16 are and will do anything to stop them. They also get a high AA. That's your set up. Given the long term development in a campaign game, the idea with this is to sort of foreshadow what the 3:16 actually is or could become. Anyway, that two-sentence backstory is already much more thinking than really necessary when you create a planet but that's mostly for me.<br/><br/>Encounter 1 - Secure the spaceport<br/>Encounter 2 - Break the enemy lines<br/>Encounter 3 - City fight<br/>Encounter 4 - Take out the enemy command post<br/><br/>Those are simply the mission objectives. I add color descriptions and whatnot. Each involves playing out a battle with the game system. In addition to dealing with whatever stuff the players are bringing into play, as they go through each of those encounters, I give them something to think about. In Encounter 1, they notice tactics and weaponry used by the enemy are similar to their own (with the exception of the dudes with the satchel charges strapped to their chests diving into the trenches with them). In Encounter 2, they find an enemy helmet with "2:16" on it inside the big enemy bunker they're supposed to take out. In Encounter 3, inside a ruined building where they have to use IR or thermal imaging, it looks like they're surrounded by enemies - an ambush (but they're actually inside a makeshift hospital nursery - more than one group I've played with has simply opened fire without bothering to check). In Encounter 4, the enemy is clearly defending civilians among their CP positions.<br/><br/>All these things I just present as part of the scene and it's up to the players to decide what to do and if it means anything to them. They're no more than conditions to be interpreted or acted on as the players see fit.<br/><br/>One group I had gleefully murdered everything in sight despite the clues to their opponents' origins (and the foreshadowing of their own ultimate fate) - enemy troops, civilians, babies, gunned 'em all down. Another group was profoundly disturbed by these things and it affected their approach to things ("Don't kill the civvies"). Which of course gives you opportunities to mess with them later. Command can chew them out for causing undue civilian casualties ("Those colonists were valuable assets!" or "There's no space on the ship for hundreds of refugees!") Just roll with it. Command issues orders and has ideas that don't make sense but until the characters themselves are the ones issuing the crazy orders, they just have to suck on it.<br/><br/>That's just generally speaking. Some players decide their characters are or aren't up for it but go along with the rest of the group (one guy in the squad that had a conscience didn't care at all who he killed - the Strength he used to end the Encounter revealed him to have been criminally insane).<br/><br/>As has been pointed out, planets take no time to whip up, and if you move fast you can clear several in an evening's play, and you should. The competitive nature of the game starts to emerge more as you go along so it becomes easier to build things off the character interactions. I usually try to go through at least two planets in a 4-hour con slot, so we can get the leveling thing going once.<br/><br/>I run 3:16 as a combination of Full Metal Jacket, Aliens, Starship Troopers and a heavy dose of Catch-22. The galaxy is out there, waiting to be killed, but you don't need to worry about making a story, only targets for the 3:16. The story will come out of what happens to the characters on the way to completing their objectives.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mjbauer" title="mjbauer"><img alt="mjbauer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/222/nPG4NFOY76VNT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mjbauer">mjbauer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256322/#Comment_256322" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-12T10:46:56+00:00" title="February 12, 2010 10:46AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=7185" rel="nofollow">Squad 42 Echo thread:</a>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>"Rumor has it, there actually is no fleet.

The one John discusses is the simple NFA test to find out whether a commanding officer has succeeded in communicating his order appropriately. The consequence of failing is that the target of the order may choose to twist or disobey the order and have some grounds for defending himself in a military tribunal (or similar) later. The specific mistake or vagueness in the command action will be narrated retroactively if and when it becomes an issue. If the command check is successful, the command is specifically not vague or arguable - there are appropriate witnesses and documentation so that if need be, it can be proved conclusively that the target of the order disobeyed. This is a bad thing for a soldier, I'd imagine.<br><br/>(If you're wondering what a deniable order might look like, consider this: one reason to have the command staff of a section commander present when you give them a strategic overview and mission orders is that should the commander decide to not obey, his own staff will know about it. Important and controversial orders are given in writing for the same reason. This is the sort of military command chain technique that's been in place since the beginning of modernity.)<br/><br/>Incidentally, the above is not a special rule so much as just an example application of the FA/NFA resolution mechanics. NFA <i>is</i> what you use to be an officer and lead people, so it's completely appropriate to make a NFA check to find out whether you can manage to give unabiguous orders without loopholes. As for why you would care to make that roll, it's exactly because if you don't, then nobody really has any grounds to figure out whether a dereliction of duty has happened. By making a check we can skip the part where the players go all legalistic and try to formulate their orders in tiresomely careful ways - which is foolish, as none of us are space troopers, so what do we know about the details of the correct and bureaucratically appropriate chain of command? A guy who is not very good at pretending to be an officer should be allowed to play one in this game, too, which is why the orders are not always evaluated literally based on free roleplaying. Darren asks why this check is necessary, though, so I should note that it's probably not that useful in everyday situations - I've never used it in practice, for example, I think. It's just an useful tool for if there ever is a question of whether a character can do something without getting court-martialed later. Just roll NFA for the commanding officer (or the character himself, perhaps, if the officer is a NPC) to find out whether there might bee some leeway in the phrasing of the orders.<br/><br/>The other mechanic under discussion is the general non-fighting conflict. It is used when two characters have a disagreement that is not violent, just like in any game. The conflict works like a violent conflict, except that any damage is "exhaustion damage" that goes away at the end of the conflict. The good Agent there quotes the bit of text that tries to convey that this works just like a normal social conflict in a modern Forgista rpg: the losing character will have to do what the winner says, but this does not imply mind control or a long-term change in their thinking, only a momentary lapse in judgment brought about by emotional pressure or whatever was the means of the conflict. So this is the mechanic you'd use to actually argue somebody into doing what you want.<br/><br/>The two mechanics here can well be used in conjunction. We might imagine that a trooper gets a dangerous order from the captain, for example, an order that would kill the whole squad for no reason if put to action. First we check the captain's NFA to find out whether the trooper might just disobey the order without consequence, perhaps because the captain only gave the order verbally, and a written order wouldn't get there in time. If the captain succeeded in NFA, then we'd know that the trooper <i>can</i> disobey, but then he'd be disregarding a direct order in a provable manner. After this the trooper might continue with a non-fighting conflict to brow-beat the captain into recalling the order; however, the captain may also command the trooper to stop arguing and do what he's told, in which case he has little choice except to do what he's told or get court-martialed. Of course the captain could also use the non-fighting conflict to not only command the other character, but also convince him to go along with the plan - could be useful when the military organization starts crumbling and you're uncertain whether a simpler order will be enough incentive to get somebody to do what you want.<br/><br/>Of course the above would presumably be extremely rare in normal play, as on the low levels and in normal play characters would presumably do what the military machine tells them most of the time. I for one wouldn't let constant bickering via the NF-conflict bog the game down without consequences as the GM - the non-fighting conflict is always clearly unmilitary in behaviour, it's about cajoling, begging, threatening, cursing, seducing, blackmailing and otherwise applying pressure, emotional or otherwise. That is not the stuff of soldiery, so the GM might well expect that the non-fighting conflict would only ever be used when the military order breaks down or when characters are off-duty. But then again, I wouldn't assume that the military machine is perfect, either - 3:16 has much more awkward and less powerful social conflict mechanics than some other, non-military games do. I'd like to think that this is fully intentional as part of the game's theme. The player characters are free people despite being soldiers, and disobeying is very emphatically not the end of the story like it would be in some other games. There's all sorts of murk in the military machine that allows the characters freedom to make their own choices, and those mechanics about leadership reflect just that. In some more generic game (Solar System, say) commanding another character would be a simple matter of making a command check; here the best you can do is to ensure that your command was received and then hope that the other player finds a court martial sufficiently threatening.<br/><br/>(One thing I'd have liked the game to have, rules-wise, is clear procedures for handling disobeyance. What I write above about court-martials and such is almost all conjencture about how things have to work; if the game had more clear rules about whether the GM can remove your character from play when he goes totally rogue, that'd be easier. Now we're left with the idea that if I my character goes crazy and stops being a soldier altogether, the best the GM can do is put the player characters into a penal battalion and send them on a suicide mission - a nice thing in theory, but rules-wise it's just more missions, the same as you'd get anyway. Ultimately the only way to have the character unambiguously removed is to go beyond the rules and declare that the character is no longer suitable for soldiery, and is thus removed from play and put into a military prison ship, left behind or just thrust into vacuum by the powers that be.)                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
