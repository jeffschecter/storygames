And, nobody ever asks any other questions -- I imagine everyone else nodding knowingly. But, I'm not sure I know what that really means. I assume -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- that "crunch" probably comes from "number crunching" and implies computation or mechanical procedure. I get how mechanical procedure can serve a game -- but I have a hard time grasping the idea of enjoying "crunch" for its own sake. <br/><br/>So . . . what does "crunch" mean to you in a system? What is your "sweet spot."

I'm not asking for a definition so much as personal opinions about what people think is fun about it. I assume some people think crunch is super fun and others think it's not fun at all. Usually, I just hear the preference one way or the other, but not much explanation about why a person likes it or doesn't. <br/><br/>Personally (and in general) the games I like tend to be rules light with rules that help clarify outcomes, and to me, that seems like the point of the rules. Obviously though, there are plenty of people who want more rules -- and I wonder why. The first game I ever played was Champions (though, it was the early 90s, so Hero System could be totally different by now), and to me all the math just seemed tedious. When I learned it didn't have to be that way, it seemed like progress. But, maybe my particular path created some personal bias, and I'm missing out on fun that I might have in the rules heavy systems I've avoided. <br/><br/>Also, DinDenver -- I assume you're in Denver, yeah?

If you min-max or make at least strategically sound choices in character creation and moves, you can achieve results close to what you desire in the game, at least a majority of the time. I don't think it's surprising, then, that people enjoy the challenge of mastering those mechanics and then executing them effectively in reaction to a changing environment. It's not the only kind of fun you can have in games, but it's definitely one of them. Especially in games where there are multiple effective strategies or the most effective strategy is not immediately obvious, there's a lot of fun in experimenting and adapting on the fly based on what works and what doesn't work as well. That said, individuals patience and excitement in mastering or interacting with complex mechanical systems varies widely too. Personally, I tend to get bored at both ends of the spectrum, when it's too complex to feel like I have any grasp of it, or when it's so simple that it can't hold my attention for more an an hour or two.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403903/#Comment_403903" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-17T09:47:50+00:00" title="January 17, 2013  9:47AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2013 9:48AM by AMBayard.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            J_Walton: That's interesting.

Is the difference between "rules heavy" and "rules light", then, that "rules light" games skip the rules mastery meta game aspect and just let you manipulate the fiction more directly? If that is what you're saying, I have a similar impression. <br/><br/>Are there things, other than (or in addition to) satisfaction from mastery, that people enjoy about crunchy games?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403904/#Comment_403904" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-17T09:50:03+00:00" title="January 17, 2013  9:50AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree - it's a curious thing, but some pointlessly complicated mechanics can sometimes (somehow) be fun.  Look at damage resolution in Battletech - endlessly crossing off bubbles.  It's insane!  And yet, I enjoyed it for years.<br/><br/>Some things come to mind:<br/><br/>1. Sometimes, detailed mechanics help (certain) players imagine what's going on.  As you cross off armor bubbles in Battletech, you can imagine the rounds (of whatever sort) penetrating various compartments.  To a degree, it's like the mechanics are telling you, "Don't forget to imagine this aspect of what's going on."  In BW, for example, the fancy footwork to get an advantageous position in combat is a separate step from whacking someone with your weapon, which means that it's always written into the sequence of events.<br/><br/>2. I think there may be some cousin of the Czege Principle at work here.  I could of course just roll d6 and on a 5+, my mech explodes, and then I could do all the imagining and describing of how it went down I like.  But with the nutty, detailed resolution, I'm actually <i>discovering</i> how my mech exploded, rather than inventing it.<br/><br/>3. Sometimes detail is there to pay homage to things that the designer and like-minded players feel are important.  If, as an armchair swordsman, I'm totally convinced that a katana slices and dices way better than (say) a broadsword, if the mechanics have a special +1 to armor penetration for katanas, then each time I come across it, it's like having my worldview played back to me.  "Yep," say the mechanics, "you're so right, katanas kick ass."<br/><br/>4. Some people like codified complexity for its own sake - the sort of folks who enjoy sudoku, mathematics or computer programming.  Mechanical crunch gives that part of my brain something to chew on.  Rigidly codified systems can sometimes have interesting emergent properties, and so this gives rise to a certain kind of "what if" solo play (or perhaps solo appreciation).  You might notice (even though it's not explicitly pointed out anywhere) that plate mail actually makes you easier to hit (but not harm) in Rolemaster; you might find the perfect way to use Leap Attack to avoid Attacks of Opportunity.  This won't happen in Fiasco.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403906/#Comment_403906" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-17T10:05:26+00:00" title="January 17, 2013 10:05AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sometimes math is fun!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403910/#Comment_403910" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-17T11:05:44+00:00" title="January 17, 2013 11:05AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some people want their characters and actions to be mechanically distinct from other people's characters and actions.  Like, if we're playing <i>Over the Edge</i> and need to get past a gate, you may roll your "Skilled Athlete" trait to scale the wall while I may talk my way past the guards using my "former con man".  We both take 3d6 and roll versus the same target number.  For some people, this is great, as we can accomplish anything, don't have to worry about complex rules for every possible action, focus more on the story, etc.  But other people (or the same people in different moods and mindsets) will want talking and scaling walls to work differently.  Mechanically differentiating actions makes them feel distinct, so physical acts seem different from social ones (or whatever division fits your game).  Meanwhile, characters can be more customized in finer detail as you have more mechanical difference between characters.  If we're both playing badass gunmen in a really rules-light game, it doesn't matter if I wield a big honking shotgun while you wield twin desert eagles.  We both roll the same trait and have the same end effectiveness.  With more complex rules, that may be a meaningful decision (I'm better in some circumstances while you're better in others).<br/><br/>Adding more mechanical detail also focuses attention onto those details, as the game naturally spends more time working on procedures related to those detailed actions while handwaving or GM fiat-ing their way through less detailed matters.  If you gloss over a difference between two characters mechanically, that is suggesting that the system doesn't think that is a meaningful or important difference.<br/><br/>(Not all crunch is good, and I really do love <i>Over the Edge.</i>)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403912/#Comment_403912" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-17T11:18:29+00:00" title="January 17, 2013 11:18AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sometimes crunch can drive drama. The significance of an action or of a need can be reinforced by the mechanics of the game in a way that can make that interaction feel more important to the player.<br/><br/>Let's say I have a scifi setting where I have a personal shield and a laser gun that use the same pool of energy. And the mechanics make me allocate a pool of dice between the 2 - I'll use my laser gun dice to attack and my shield dice to defend.<br/><br/>So when I go all out attack and drop my shield to nothing in the hopes that I can drop the guy before he can retaliate and hit my undefended self, the crunch is reinforcing that sense of risk and helping me, as a player, feel it. And all the other players at the table can see, in very real terms, just how much of a risk I am taking. The communication of the risk level is clear and transparent.<br/><br/>If, on the other hand, I am just narrating that I'm going in at an all out attack and not bothering with my defenses and implicitly accepting more dire in-fiction consequences if I fail at the roll, then the exact nature of the amount of extra risk I am subjecting myself to is a bit more fuzzy. I'm relying on judgement and perhaps negotiation to determine just how nasty the potential failure might be.<br/><br/>For some folks, removing some of the fuzzy judgement call and negotiation stuff makes them feel like they can engage more directly with potential outcomes and accept them and enjoy that tension. They like it because they know the tension will be resolved by the dice on the table and that they won't be screwed over by the capriciousness of their GM.<br/><br/>For other folks, removing the math and the not-exactly-what-my-character-knows tactical decision making makes them feel like they can engage more directly with the fictional situation and with the emotional state of their character for whom they are making decisions. They don't want decisions about dice allocation to overshadow their decisions about righteous vengeance or defending their beloved or whatever else is "really" at stake.<br/><br/>And, of course, there are not just 2 camps. And I'm sure there are other vectors than these 2. But some sort of continuum between these 2 extremes is most often what people are talking about when they are talking about hitting a sweet spot for crunch.<br/><br/>For me, I love it when the mechanics of a game drive interesting decisions that feel like they align reasonably closely with the decisions my character is making. I like it when mechanics help provide a real drive that provoke in-fiction actions in response. Especially I like it if the mechanics can do all this using small elegant numbers so I don't feel like I'm doing homework for a statistics class.<br/><br/>For example, my son has died each of the two times he's played Dungeon World. The mechanics are trying to tell him he needs to ask for help when he gets hurt. He's trying to ignore that and focus on who he wants his Ranger to shoot next. The system is giving him real and meaningful feedback about that decision and is encouraging him to make a different decision. It's still his call, obviously. But there are clear mechanical consequences tied to his decisions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403913/#Comment_403913" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-17T11:43:48+00:00" title="January 17, 2013 11:43AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2013 11:51AM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting topic! I think a few other people posted while I was writing this, but I figure multiple points of view would be useful. All speculation, but I think the desire for crunch comes from a few different places. <br/><br/>First, tradition. A lot role-players came from wargames where crunch drives the action. The game literally is the rules and numbers and mechanical interactions between the players. When they start toying with RPGs, they expect for the crunch to carry over. A lack of crunch feels like incomplete rule systems for simulating a real world combat. <br/><br/>A lot of RP-gamers that come from traditional games are just used to there being a lot of rules to represent each and every type of action or activity and feel short changed when things are not covered explicitly. I suspect that a lot of this codification comes from a desire to ensure that GM's do not use "fiat" (in the negative sense)  to make rulings on various situations, instead being able to refer to specific rules for things - and those rules need to take into account a lot of other facets so that people feel like their character's numerical power is being fairly represented in the game. So in a way, crunchy rules in RPGs might exist to reduce distrust within the potentially adversarial relationship between the GM and the players.<br/><br/>Also, game designers in the 80's and 90's made their money off of rules, and if the big game designers put rules into the system, then they must be there for a reason (peacocking). <br/><br/>Another reason is a lot of people find the gamey, simulationy rules to be fun to work with. The D&amp;D boards are filled with optimization discussions for no other reason than maximizing the numerical effectiveness within the scope of the rules of the game brings with it a sense of control, achievement, and pride. Find the right combination of mechanics to make your character extremely effective is gratifying.<br/><br/>Another reason is structure. The whole hobby of role-playing games is designed to help facilitate what would otherwise just be freeform improvisation. The rules exist to create a procedure for play, to facilitate and direct the chaos into a clear and ordered social system. Without the rules in place, gameplay can feel like everyone is just making things up as they go along, which can reduce the sense of legitimacy to the whole process.<br/><br/>So those are the reasons crunchy rules might exist from my point of view. But what about the so-called "sweet spot"? Well, that's just a personal preference for how much math and procedure is called for within the rules of the game. This might be tied to the whole "left brain/ right brain" thing. Some people's brains work better with numbers and statistics while other people's brains work better with abstraction and imagination. <br/><br/>Coupling the inherent abstract and imaginative nature of role-playing with the codified and procedural nature of rules may help to create a sort of compromise or common ground for these two different types of people, so each gets something out of the game experience. Of course, most people are little of both so it fits nicely with those people too. For people who may not have the easiest time imagining what's going on the fiction at any given moment, rules help provide a more tangible sense of events, consequences, changes, and improvements. <br/><br/>I used to feel the desire for heavily crunchy games, but looking back, I know now that it was just a matter of comfort level. I felt that systems like GURPS and D&amp;D were necessary in order to facilitate a role-playing game, but really I just wasn't able to make the mental leap to more simplistic systems that relied more on narrative and personal decisions. My personal sweet spot for crunch is probably World of Dungeons, and more specifically the Streets of Marienburg/Mos Eisley level of crunch, but there is some wiggle room there.<br/><br/><a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?PHPSESSID=54810o59evkr7f0845uaia0cdrnqd2fn&amp;topic=6012.0" rel="nofollow">EDIT: This discussion seems like a good representative of how some people just feel the necessity for explicit rules for various tasks, while others prefer to use a simple mechanic or focus on the fiction instead of the mechanics.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/olepeder" title="olepeder"><img alt="olepeder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/olepeder">olepeder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403914/#Comment_403914" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-17T12:04:56+00:00" title="January 17, 2013 12:04PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The whole hobby of role-playing games is designed to help facilitate what would otherwise just be freeform improvisation.</blockquote>\n*Freeform improvisation.* You just touched my sweet spot...<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>I know "system matters" and all, but Yeah!

That ship has clearly already sailed: you know what it is and you don't like it much. Some people will complain about too many fiddly little rules in a high-crunch system, other people will complain that rules-light systems don't give them anything to work with. Fortunately, that's okay. Big ol' world, lots of different ways to get along in it, right?<br/><br/>Anyway, people like playing chess, and backgammon, and cribbage, and Risk, and Settlers of Catan, and poker, and videogames of all kinds, and Exquisite Corpse, and doing writing exercises like composing entire novels without ever using the letter 'e', and walking down the sidewalk without ever stepping on a crack, and playing the stock market, and knitting, and basically doing a lot of things that require mastering rules (some of them very complex) and using them effectively and creatively. It's a common human thing. We like to know what to do and we like to do it well.<br/><br/>So, 'crunch' in a roleplaying game is a way of satisfying that urge. It gives you stuff you can do that engages the systems-mastery module in your brain, it gives you something you can manipulate, it gives you guidelines and paths of least resistance you can follow (or subvert), it gives an impartial framework to mediate disagreements, and all of the other stuff other people have mentioned. How much any of those things appeal to <i>anyone</i> is highly personal, and probably varies from day to day and maybe even from minute to minute. I mean, some nights everyone at the table has a great time statting up their superhero base, other nights everyone just wants to have in-character conversations about pop culture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403920/#Comment_403920" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-17T13:15:58+00:00" title="January 17, 2013  1:15PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a dumb piece of gamer jargon that doesn't actually make much sense if you think about it too much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403921/#Comment_403921" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-17T13:20:02+00:00" title="January 17, 2013  1:20PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>but I have a hard time grasping the idea of enjoying "crunch" for its own sake. </blockquote>\nSo since you said this right up front, I should probably note that I'm not going to try to convince you that it's enjoyable. .</blockquote>\nWell, I also said this . . . \n<blockquote> . . . maybe my particular path created some personal bias, and I'm missing out on fun that I might have in the rules heavy systems I've avoided. </blockquote>\nSo, convince away, the ship is still in the port. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403923/#Comment_403923" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-17T13:30:25+00:00" title="January 17, 2013  1:30PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2013 1:31PM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think it's something you can really be convinced of.

You have more tactical options and and can better exploit the situation if you understand the rules better. It is like exploration bonuses or fighting games where the better you know the video game the better you will do.<br/>  I think declaring a game "heavy crunch" or "heavy fluff" is meaningless. The threshold for that is a moving target from player to player. If you are a Hero System player D&amp;D4 is low crunch and if you are a Wushu payer D&amp;D4 is heavy crunch.<br/>  But, I do not feel like this is a break-down of the language/terminology used. I think most people when they hear or read this term, they get the idea pretty quickly. The problem is its objectivity. But there is not really a more objective term. The best I have seen is "handling time," but even that is subject to the skill and knowledge of the players measuring them.<br/>  Still we need some way to objectively talk about these things.

Terms like "crunch", "fluff", "fiat", "balance", "social contract", "game" and a bunch of others that are always flying around. There is a need to describe ideas and phenomenon specific to this hobby when discussing the intricacies of gameplay and design, so people make-up terms to fill in the blanks. But, there is no universally accepted authority to nail down the definitions of these terms. So people on the internet create terms, then other people see them and re-use them with their own concept of what the word means, and you end up with terms that everyone in the hobby uses, yet nobody can agree on what they mean exactly.<br/><br/>So, all you can really do is qualify the use of the terms in your discussions by first offering a subjective definition of the term ("This is how I'm going to use the term for the purposes of this discussion."). Unfortunately, people are often more interested in debating the definition of the term you chose to use than actually accept your definition of the term for the purposes of the discussion and actually discuss. <br/><br/>So, to me, terms like "crunch" aren't exactly useless or dumb, they're just very flexible and subjective. Their use can still be effective as long as everyone is on the same page as to how the term is being used in the context. If everyone in the discussion can agree on how the term "crunch" is being used, then it can save a lot of time and actually help facilitate the discussion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403926/#Comment_403926" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-17T14:13:38+00:00" title="January 17, 2013  2:13PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2013 2:17PM by AMBayard.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>2.

Mechanics meant to carry some of the narration load. An extreme example would be a videogame, right? Where it's nearly ALL "mechanics" and the input from the player is very limited.

Those are the kind of rules I like too. And, I guess I've always thought that was the goal -- to have the mechanics support the story. (I think Don't Rest Your Head does a really good job -- for example.) But, what I'm getting from a lot of this thread is that there are plenty of people for whom that is not actually the goal -- people who want to engage with rules almost independent from the story. Like playing chess while you write a novel. I don't think that impulse is bad. It just seems like a non-intuitive combination of activities. I think it's interesting. \n<blockquote> This discussion seems like a good representative of how some people just feel the necessity for explicit rules for various tasks, while others prefer to use a simple mechanic or focus on the fiction instead of the mechanics. </blockquote>\nYeah, I've always thought that was interesting. Especially when the mechanical representation of a task doesn't REALLY make much sense. Like, if you have a game where "climbing" = your DEX + Climb skill for a garden variety example, what does that even mean? Actual climbing takes physical strength and endurance and decision making and nerve -- so, it's weird that we can boil it down to "DEX" or whatever. But, there does a appear to be a desire for mechanics like that -- it doesn't seem to matter that the abstraction has nothing to do with "reality," the important thing is that there is a task specific mechanic. I'd like to understand that better.   <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403932/#Comment_403932" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-17T14:58:07+00:00" title="January 17, 2013  2:58PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> But, what I'm getting from a lot of this thread is that there are plenty of people for whom that is not actually the goal -- people who want to engage with rules almost independent from the story.

Of drawing on a knowledge of how historical figures have addressed the same or similar chess problems successfully or unsuccessfully.<br/><br/>One could, certainly, write the story of a chess game as a novel, by picking apart all those myriad connections to the many previous stories of chess and tying them together into a narrative of what happened and what it meant.<br/><br/>Arguably, that's what story construction always is - giving context to a conclusion by backtracking through influences and thereby constructing meaning out of a sequence of actions.<br/><br/>The chess game is the framework that constrains the interaction. The story is the meaning we attribute to the outcome.<br/><br/>-----<br/>Whew. I got really longwinded and ivory tower theoretical there. Not sure if there's anything really meaningful in that.<br/><br/>For a more concrete statement, I'll start here:<br/><br/>For some folks, the constrained interactions of the tactical crunch game provide a rich source of surprise and creativity. The unpredictable but influence-able outcome of a series of tactical decisions and randomizations are an exciting factor for them.<br/><br/>And I can see the reason for it. I like strategy games in general. I particularly like games that have a lot of meaningful strategic choice with a little bit of chance (which is why I don't invest a lot of time in games with no chance at all, like chess).<br/><br/>Sometimes, a good RPG game can be a good strategy game, with story elements to make it have meaning.<br/><br/>And sometimes I like that. Kind of like the way I often like watching a good shoot-em-up action movie. And sometimes I like a nice romcom. And sometimes I like a heartwrenching tragic drama.<br/><br/>My parents tend not to like the action movies nearly as often. They tend to go for the heavy dramas more often. A matter of taste.<br/><br/>Crunch is kinda like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403934/#Comment_403934" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-17T15:05:07+00:00" title="January 17, 2013  3:05PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2013 3:05PM by Rickard.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>4.

People tend to seeing patterns in everything and some loves to engage into it.<br/><br/>In my book there are two kinds of crunch. One is the complexity of the game, normally given by a list of data (feats, powers, weapons et c.). The other one is complexity while you use the system. <b>Go</b> is a perfect example for this. Easy-to-learn-mechanics, but it's complex in how you play the game. I actually prefer the second, even if I can't help diving into the first one (does anyone else has a library of <b>D&amp;D4</b> builds? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> ).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403935/#Comment_403935" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-17T15:05:45+00:00" title="January 17, 2013  3:05PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2013 3:06PM by creases.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to expand on my comment a bit, because it occurs to me that it might come across as unhelpful! For which I am sorry!<br/><br/>I didn't mean it to be unhelpful because it really is my answer to the question---crunch is (often) fun because math is (often) fun! But, I don't really know why math is fun. I mean, if you asked why fluff is fun, I'd say, because exploring somebody else's fictional world is fun! But why is that fun? I dunno.<br/><br/>But if I can take some liberty here, I think I can answer a question slightly different from the one you asked, but close to it: When is crunch fun? I mean, it's not always fun.<br/><br/>For me, there are basically two factors that make it fun. First, crunch is best when it complements the fiction. I don't think anybody's going to dispute that. But, second, it also has to be compelling in its own right. Crunch is fun when there's an elegant mathematical system that affords interesting tactical variations with their own measures of efficacy.<br/><br/>My interest in the crunchy stuff is only independent from my interest in the story when the crunch is independent from the story. I mean, an example here is D&amp;D 4e. I love the combat system. It's fun and I think it's great. By my second criterion, it's really outstanding. Before you even sit down to play there's a lot of planning that you can put into a build, and then you have to test it out in the field in parties of different composition against foes of different levels and abilities. Do I want a glass cannon, or do I want to balance damage output with durability? I can calculate my expected DPR (which itself requires a balance between accuracy and damage expressions), and I can calculate my expected combat lifespan, and I can try to maximize one or the other or the product of them. Or I can try to maximize my support options like forced movement or healing. And then, when I'm actually in play, I have lots of interesting choices to make about maneuvering, proximity to allies and enemies, which powers to use at which times against which enemies, etc. The choices I make at the table are informed by the choices I make during chargen and vice versa.<br/><br/>But does 4e's mathematical sophistication make the fiction better? Or does it reflect the fiction well, or vice versa? Eh, I dunno about that. That's surely its weak point. It would be better if it were tied more closely to the fiction. So by my first criterion, it's not great. To that extent, I would say that my interest in 4e's crunch is independent of my interest in the fiction. But I would always rather have both!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403939/#Comment_403939" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-17T15:57:45+00:00" title="January 17, 2013  3:57PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            creases: I think that's an excellent analysis! Parsing different KINDS of crunch is very helpful. Arguably a game like Polaris is "crunchy" in the sense that there is a lot to keep in mind at once and system mastery is important if you want to advocate effectively for your character -- but, it's fundamentally different, I think, from your description of D&amp;D 4e. To me, the division, is exactly on the line you identified. <br/><br/>So, I guess, in that respect a "rules heavy" and "joy of mechanical tactical advantage for its own sake" isn't REALLY the same thing -- it's just that there is a high correlation. You COULD have a rules heavy game with a purely story driven focus. <br/><br/>Good talk everyone! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403944/#Comment_403944" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-17T18:44:51+00:00" title="January 17, 2013  6:44PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2013 6:46PM by Paul_T.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the Forge jargon, there was a relatively useful measure of rules complexity in the term "Points of Contact".<br/><br/>I don't remember the precise Edwardsian definition, but the basic concept was, "How many times do you have refer to something outside the fiction to carry out some game action?" <br/><br/>If you can play without referring to any rules/procedures hardly at all (e.g. two players sit in place and tell each other stories in character), that's "low Points of Contact".<br/><br/>If you have to compare two numbers, roll a die, generate a certain value, and then compare it to a card drawn by another player just to tell a little bit of your character's story, that might be "high Points of Contact".<br/><br/>I would say there are a couple of good values to mechanical procedures/crunch that haven't been discussed (or not too much) yet in this thread:<br/><br/>1. Avoiding cognitive dissonance in play. Many people want to make decisions "in character", or from a certain point of view relating to the fiction, and knowing that the mechanics do not reflect that view can be unpleasant or uncomfortable. For example, in a very simple system like Over the Edge, a strong character and a famous character might have exactly the same odds of lifting a heavy rock. However, the famous character has been described as very weak. In play, a player finds it difficult to relate this to the fiction: they are playing the weak celebrity character, and it's very important to them to lift this rock (maybe someone they love is trapped under it or something). Logically (according to the fiction), they would call on their stronger friend to do it. However, the player knows that, because of the way the game works, their own odds are just as good: they might as well do it themselves. <br/><br/>Some people find that disconnect hard to deal with: in this instance, they would prefer if the outcomes given by the rules matched the fiction better.<br/><br/>(Note that this could be accomplished well by simple rules and poorly by complex rules. It's not necessarily a feature of "high crunch". The important point is that the "crunch" provided by the game suits the players' priorities, whether it's simple or complex.)<br/><br/>Imagine playing an RPG about a martial arts competition to save the world. The rule is that when two warriors fight, we describe what happens, and then flip a coin. The winner of the coin flip wins the fight and advances to the next round in the competition.<br/><br/>Is this satisfying enough to play? <br/><br/>For most people, I think they would find the system too simplistic. It doesn't seem to matter at all what anyone describes and the rules give us very little help in creating an exciting fight scene, no matter how we choose to approach it.<br/><br/>2. A game's rules aren't just about generating odds for various fictional outcomes. The rules structure or modify our social interactions. A good set of rules (for a given game, for a given group) create interactions that we enjoy or find exciting.<br/><br/>Consider how the addition of "sex moves" to Apocalypse World has affected people's games in a number of significant ways, even if simply by encouraging the players to discuss the role of sex in their game (something they may never have tried to do before).<br/><br/>One could make the argument that having separate rules for what happens when two characters have sex is an additional rule which is not required to play the game. Why not just cut it out, ignore it? It's arguably completely unnecessary.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the rule has a significant impact on how people play the game.<br/><br/>3. Various rules interactions can create unexpected events or directions for play.<br/><br/>A simple example, using "sex moves" again, since I mentioned those:<br/><br/>In my last Apocalypse World game, a Hardholder (a type of character who rules a small settlement) welcomed an emissary from another settlement. According to the rules, giving someone lodgings and food costs a certain amount of "barter" (an abstract unit in the game), but there is a rule which says that if the Hardholder has sex with someone, they can offer them a gift "for free".<br/><br/>When the player noticed that, he decided that the Hardholder would sleep with the emissary (he was short on barter), and from there a romantic subplot has blossomed.<br/><br/>I'm glad we had that bit of "crunch" in the game, or we would never have had this situation--it's not one this group would normally come up with on their own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403949/#Comment_403949" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-17T20:11:39+00:00" title="January 17, 2013  8:11PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For every guy (or gal) that has drooled over <a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/1107/Guns%21-Guns%21-Guns%21-v1.1?term=guns+guns+guns&amp;it=1" rel="nofollow">Guns, Guns, Guns</a>.

Often a trite one.<br/><br/>When a competitive or tactical game is too simple, it becomes an exercise in finding an obvious loophole and exploiting it. Not because doing so is fun, necessarily, but because <i>it's obviously the most effective choice</i>. When a theme-heavy, emotionally-rich game is too simple, it doesn't do its fair share of the work of creating pregnant drama. It's like a director saying, "Oh, I don't know, in this scene just say something brilliant and be really engaging." Those are just some examples - ways different games can feel flat or non-robust because they're too simple.<br/><br/>A game needs to have enough structure, enough crunch, enough complexity, whatever... to ensure that the players are engaged, pushed in interesting directions, asked to make hard choices and sort priorities, and that they don't know how it'll go in advance, just by reading the rules.<br/><br/>Even in a game with a fixed ending, or a fixed scene structure, complexity and crunch are needed to ensure that the experience is moving and unexpected and engrossing. Too simple and it's not really a game, it's just an exercise.<br/><br/>But a lot of games add in way too much crunch, and way too much of the boring type specifically. Convoluted dice tricks and elaborate math, for example. The theory I'm working with at the moment is that a game should always ask you to consider one piece of information more than you can reasonably consider, at any given time. So that you're always saying, "hm, this might be crazy, but I think I've got an idea!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403954/#Comment_403954" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-17T21:21:00+00:00" title="January 17, 2013  9:21PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great stuff in this thread!<br/><br/>I don't think any discussion of this type is complete without reference to Vincent's Clouds and Boxes theory.

I hate it. It's fine if you like it, but my experiences have always been slow, bogged down, and begging for more prep than it feels like should be necessary. The rules and fiction love arguing with each other, the game is filled with little gotcha rules that bog down play if you remember them, and you're not even getting the nice reward of fun combat like you get from 4e. I wish they'd cut all the extraneous crap out and just give me a simple D&amp;D system that was consistent but not filled with pain. I hated lots of systems of similar complexity, so I thought it was just the number of rules involved.<br/><br/>*Then I discovered The Burning Wheel, a game that gets a bad rap for being really complicated. But I adore the complexity of The Burning Wheel. Every rule sings, and when they all are used together The Burning Wheel is surprising and stimulating and tactical in ways no other RPG has even come close to for me (Tenra Bansho Zero looks like it might get in the vicinity, though). I love the rules to pieces.<br/><br/>*Savage Worlds changes it's chase rules once a printing almost. No one ever really uses them, or likes them. Unlike a lot of vehicle rules for games, they aren't even complicated. They're probably simpler than the normal combat rules. So why don't people use 'em? My guess is because they aren't very engaging. The rules are basically a series of rolls that are 'do you crash? yes/no. Can you get in range to shoot? Yes/No. There's no actual tactical options for this, you just keep rolling until the 'no' results cause stuff to end. The chase rules have changed a lot between editions but at the end of the day, they always come down to a system that's more complicated than a simple roll, but has no real player input. So they never have solved the real problem with the rules.<br/><br/>For me it's not about how complicated the rules are, it's about what the rules bring to the table. D&amp;D 3 has hard rules that tell me the exact information Moldvay D&amp;D does but with more work. Chases in Savage Worlds don't do much of anything, even though they're not very complicated. And The Burning Wheel is rich and tasty, and delivers lots of awesome if you engage the system head on.<br/><br/>So yeah, I'm not a big fan of the term 'crunch', it doesn't tell me enough about a game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_403973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403973/#Comment_403973" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-18T07:09:56+00:00" title="January 18, 2013  7:09AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The point of 'crunch'?<br/><br/>It's to provide...\n<ul>\n<li>a stimulating experience in itself.</li>\n<li>a non-verbal communication medium.</li>\n<li>inspiration as to what happens in the fiction.</li>\n<li>a way to present clear constraints and choices.</li>\n<li>a way to generate results which make sense in the fiction.</li>\n<li>a way to break consensus and move players out of their comfort zones.</li>\n<li>a way to gauge who is 'winning'.</li>\n<li>a way to ensure all players have a part to play.</li>\n</ul>\nI probably missed a few, but this should be pretty useful list to start with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403975/#Comment_403975" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-18T07:27:45+00:00" title="January 18, 2013  7:27AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is interesting, this has helped me understand some of my dissatisfaction with Dogs in the Vineyard's conflict mechanism.

Working within a framework to achieve an ends, using my predictive skills to know how things might work or what I need to look for to achieve what I want.  I don't always want to play a game like that, but I can enjoy it.<br/><br/>I also used to play miniatures games competitively, going to a couple national tournaments.  As much as I lament one of my groups being stuck in 3.5 D&amp;D, every time the mini's get setup those skills and memories jump to the front and I'm fully engaged.<br/><br/>But I have a hard time using those skills and also being an engaging GM.  For example, I have played Burning Wheel and enjoyed it.  I would love to play a complete Burning Empires game some time.  But I cannot GM that system, or at least not yet.  I tried running a game and it fell apart because I couldn't stay focused enough on the rules to make them work while trying to keep the pacing and mood for the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404025/#Comment_404025" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-18T19:59:50+00:00" title="January 18, 2013  7:59PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2013 8:01PM by Nathan_H.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Crunch is shared language and expectation.

I would add, then, that in many trad games (I've been reigniting my interest in GURPS, lately, for example), all these crunchy rules, while they take <i>input</i> from things in the fiction, don't actually contribute <i>back</i> to the fiction very often. Like, we may need to interrogate the fiction closely to figure out exactly what modifiers apply to my damage roll... but ultimately it's not, fundamentally, interesting whether I do 6 points of damage or 10.<br/><br/>But certainly it is true that even when such a ruleset is working well, it will be boring for some people no matter what. But that just gets back to proper expectation-setting.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404134/#Comment_404134" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-20T12:54:56+00:00" title="January 20, 2013 12:54PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Great point!

I think the first story-games were partly a reaction to the fact that the system elements often contributed only little to the overall story, which was ultimately pretty much up to the GM.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404149/#Comment_404149" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-20T15:04:13+00:00" title="January 20, 2013  3:04PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, exactly!
