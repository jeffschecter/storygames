(This said right <b>after</b> I hit his mech for three damage and blew off its remaining attachments.)  We played without spotting rules the first time, but I think I'll introduce those for the second or third game.  (Lest you think I'm crazy for expecting a seven-year-old to grok this game, he's performs at two to three grade levels above his peers.  He just finished reading the first Harry Potter book to himself.  He plays Settlers of Catan and wins.  He scares me.)<br/><br/>A thread here earlier this year had a brief exchange concerning record sheets and whether they were useful or not... I find them useful, especially with a seven-year-old.  Mostly my issue is that I <i>can't</i> just look at my mech and quickly remember what its attachments are... "Are those extra legs just for show?  Is that a direct-fire or artillery weapon?"  Especially with my son's mechs... "this red stud is my laser".  Thus, my kid-friendly record sheet... feedback is very welcome.<br/><br/><img alt="Mechaton Record Sheet 1" height="345" src="http://raven.phoenyx.net/mutterings/pics/mechaton_sheet1.png" width="249"/><br/><br/>I blog for at least three posts about Mechaton on my blog <a href="http://raven.phoenyx.net/mutterings/20070718.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  I talk a bit about playing with a seven-year-old who doesn't grok humaniform mecha combat, my thoughts on the rules, etc.<br/><br/>Now I need to find adults to play with. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
