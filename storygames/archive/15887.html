I want to see more things like this (actually I want to <i>write </i>more things like this!)<br/><br/><i>The Book of the Smoke</i> is a small, dense volume that's a sort of London travelogue, as written by some occult dude in the thirties. It's a great mix of historical information with a weird overlay of strangeness, and if you read the whole thing it hints at a story of its own. As an adventure seed generator for a London-based Cthulhu-flavored campaign it would be fantastic. I've enjoyed reading it in random bits on my bus commute.<br/><br/>Have you used<i> The Book of the Smoke</i> in your gaming?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360710/#Comment_360710" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T06:23:55+00:00" title="February 20, 2012  6:23AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never even heard of it until just this moment and was about to ask, "Where can you get it?" when I noticed the embedded link.

I used it to run two improvised games of Trail of Cthulhu. The premise was that the characters are members of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPO_Film_Unit" rel="nofollow">GPO Film Unit</a> a ground-breaking documentary film unit established in 1933. Their boss gets a copy of the book and asks them to make a film about one of the locations. The first group had never played Trail before, or even read any HPL. They had the book for about 10 minutes and chose to investigate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Theatre_in_the_Adelphi" rel="nofollow">Little Theatre</a>. We played for about 3 hours as they investigated a strange machine that apparently summoned spirits on stage in a Grand Guignol play called De L'Au-dela (it helped that I did the research on this entry). They ended up burning down a house in the suburbs and destroying the machine, as well as it's inventor. They described their experience as the highlight of the show.<br/><br/>The second group were more familiar with HPL and some had played Trail. They approached me on Friday for a game on Saturday so they had all night to choose something to investigate. They chose King's Hospital and the investigation covered several locations including Bunhill Fields and some dodgy characters including Amery Greville, the dubious editor, Chessover, the grasping bookdealer, and Paula Lewis, a smart assistant publisher from a South London press. In the end, they had to make difficult choices about saving London from some kind of impending doom. This game lasted about 4 1/2 hours but could have gone on longer. The players touched on the mystery of the book and I guess we could follow it up next year.<br/><br/>I ran a game at the London Indie Meet-up on a similar premise which resulted in a three hour game investigating a haunted room in the British Library. This time the doom was more personal and was avoided by shifting the assault onto someone else.<br/><br/>I've also used it in our own group. I started the game by asking the players to report a recurring dream involving the river and used entries in the book to create a backstory which lead to fighting Nazi archaeologists and looking for missing manuscripts in 1536 (the year, not the time of day).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360718/#Comment_360718" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T06:46:16+00:00" title="February 20, 2012  6:46AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can totally see using it as a tool for improvisational sessions of Trail or regular Cthulhu.
