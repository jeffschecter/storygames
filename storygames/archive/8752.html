And second, because of that nagging worry in the back of my head saying, "everyone's going to think they're crap."<br/><br/>I know, I'm slightly paranoid.  That's just my personal damage, exacerbated by many years of Usenet.  Anyway, last weekend, I was doing a little research to try to determine what web hosting company I might want to use, and found many recommendations here for Dreamhost.  So I went to look at their site, and discovered they were having a sale -- $9.95 for a year of web hosting.  At that ridiculously low price, I immediately snagged it.  And so excuse number one went away.  A further week has allowed me to nibble away enough at my insecurities to get rid of excuse number two, and so, the playtest rules are now up.<br/><br/>The web site is:  <a href="http://www.andcastnoshadow.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.andcastnowshadow.com</a><br/><br/>If you'd like to go straight to the playtest rules, they're at:  <a href="http://www.andcastnoshadow.com/acns-draft.txt" rel="nofollow">http://www.andcastnoshadow.com/acns-draft.txt</a><br/><br/>For those who haven't looked at the previous threads, here's a brief description:<br/><br/><i>...and cast no shadow</i> is a game about vampires and their victims.  It's meant to work for both traditional vampire stories (e.g., <i>Dracula</i>) and for contemporary, relationship-based vampires stories (e.g., <i>Twilight</i>).  Play happens in a series of "chapters", and at the end of each chapter, players are free to switch characters.  Players may also choose not to pick a particular character as theirs at all, in which case they may choose to play a different "minor character" (one that doesn't have a player that has chosen it as "theirs") in each of their scenes in that chapter.<br/><br/>The rules that are up are those we used for the first playtest.  They are incomplete in places.  Any and all questions and comments are welcomed, but I'm especially looking for feedback about what needs examples (there are very few right now) and what's hard to understand.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>(Edited to make the URLs into links)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193561/#Comment_193561" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-22T10:11:11+00:00" title="February 22, 2009 10:11AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This looks pretty cool. I'm a big fan of this sort of fiction and cinema, so I can't wait to give it a shot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
