                    This is the first in a short series of essays that I'm working on.  Thoughts welcome as I prepare to start on the second one.<br/><br/><b>A New Anthem, Part 1:<br/>The Need for Low-Impact Games</b><br/><br/>This series of essays is an effort to summarize a dozen different conversations that have happened in the past few weeks.  Many people have been extremely helpful in my effort to articulate this, so major thanks go out to Annie Rush, Jess Pease, Mo Turkington, Jere Genest, Claire Bickell, Shreyas Sampat, Nir Shiffer, Thomas Robertson, WiredNavi, and Selene Tan.<br/><br/><b>The Audience</b><br/><br/>The group of players that I'm personally most interested in designing for wants to see more Ã¢â‚¬Å“low-impactÃ¢â‚¬Â mechanics, game rules that don't require players to deal with many meta/OOC issues once play has begun, including managing game resources, thinking strategically about how best to use the rules, negotiating or competing with the other players to determine "what happens," setting stakes, narrating outcomes not directly related to their character, comparing numbers or fiddling with math to determine results, and the like.<br/><br/>Players looking for low-impact play want the feeling of being in an interesting story. In fact, among them, there tends to be quite a fetish-ization of "character" and "story" as high ideals. Many are excited to play every week mostly "to find out what happens next," either to their character or in the overall story as a whole. They are prone to My Guy, not wanting to break their own standards of consistent character behavior even to create more interesting situations. They live for Color. They can often be satisfied with simply being participants in the GM's story as long as they are entertained and are frequently given the opportunity to be the center of attention. They thrive in online freeform games, whether play-by-post, PBeM, or chat.<br/><br/>As far as tabletop goes, players looking for low-impact play have traditionally contented themselves with games like Amber, Ars Magicka, Changeling, and, in more recent years, Nobilis, Buffy, and Exalted, though you can find them playing anything. In America, quite a few of them have been involved in Mind's Eye Theater at one point or another and, in my experience (though Jere Genest has already disagreed) a large number of them seem to be female, though there are quite a few male adherents too.  Annie Rush suggested that perhaps there are more men than women interested in low-impact play, but that a larger percentage of female roleplayers (compared to males) greatly enjoy or prefer to play this way.<br/><br/>They are not necessarily into immersion, but can be. Many simply don't like the idea of breaking the fantasy/daydream to deal with mechanical issues, because this distracts from experiencing and enjoying the story. They roleplay to listen to and be a part of a story. Playing a fun game is, at best, a secondary goal. This is often why they end up ignoring most of the rules and largely playing freeform, because their experience of the story is more important than their experience of the game.<br/><br/>Low-impact players are often targeted by White Wolf, with their rhetoric about stories and storytelling, and their Golden Rule to ignore the rules. Other game companies often play to this audience in order to attract more female players and mistake the low-impact dislike of fiddling with mechanics as a kind of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Barbie says: Math is hardÃ¢â‚¬Â mentality. Many developers attempt to streamline or dumb down the rules of existing games, as with Blue Rose. This doesn't really do much to help these players, however.<br/><br/>This group understands that most mechanics can be replaced by a solid social contract, playing with the right people, and building a strong shared history of play with the others in the group. They are less interested in mastering the rules of the game and more interested in forming a community of practice, most likely with its own idiosyncratic standards and ways of operating.  Annie also said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I prefer to ignore rules than play without rules. Rules provide a safety net and an entry point.Ã¢â‚¬Â  That's rather important.  Sometimes they do know the rules but just prefer not to use them or prefer determining the outcome themselves instead of leaving them up to the dice.                </div>

<b>Designing for Them?</b><br/><br/>No one has yet published a game which fills the needs and desires of people looking for low-impact play.  As Claire Bickell so eloquently put it, Ã¢â‚¬Å“ I havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t experienced any systems that do work for me, only ones which suck different amounts.Ã¢â‚¬Â  And Nir Shiffer adds, Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Both in the Israeli and the Swedish gaming scenes this [low-impact play] is the majority opinion (or, because "majority" is a bitch to define, at least a very widespread preference) regardless of gender. This is why we make such heavy use of freeform and freeform half-breeds Ã¢â‚¬â€œ there just isn't a fully confined system to support it yet.Ã¢â‚¬Â<br/><br/>Many indie designers, even ones that I respect immensely, are frustrated by players with these sorts of desires, because low-impact players seem to reject most traditional design work, not appreciating the neat little rules that designers develop to make play more interesting. And low-impact players do this from what can seem to be an "allergy to mechanics." Often, to this type of player, system really doesn't matter, and that's antithetical to the soul of the indie design movement. Designers throw their hands up in the air and storm off in a huff. How do you design rules for people who tend to just ignore most of the rules?  <br/><br/>Mo describes a fairly common experience: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Brand and I have had a number of discussions where I have dismantled wholecloth mechanics, or randomization or chance mechanics out of system and he has ended up saying something like: 'But then it's not really a game, is it?'  To me it is. Game in an RPG context is more synonymous with the concept of play than it is with game in the sense of Risk or football.Ã¢â‚¬Â<br/><br/>Still, even designers who prefer this kind of play have a hard time approaching it from a design perspective.  I think Annie nails it: Ã¢â‚¬Å“It's funny... The group of players you describe is the one I fall into, but not really the one I write for. ...It's like I don't know my native language and have been working with the one that everyone else around me is speaking.Ã¢â‚¬Â  <br/><br/>For a while now, I've been trying to come up with a style of game design that's the opposite of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Macho Nar YangÃ¢â‚¬Â  design camp that emerged from The Forge.  The Forge inspired a whole series of games whose major unifying trait seems to be their Social-Contract-in-a-Can, mechanics that channel and redirect what would normally be disruptive player choices (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Okay, then, I shoot you!Ã¢â‚¬Â) to create exciting play.  The mechanics of these games allow you to pick up the rules with a group of complete strangers at a convention and jump straight into the kind of balls-to-the-wall, intense inter-character conflict that usually requires the trust and comfort that comes from a lengthy shared play history.  Forge-style games have traditionally encouraged individual players to make interesting, dramatic choices that keep raising the stakes of each subsequent conflict.  They have not been especially good at encouraging players to be sensitive to and supportive of the desires of their companions.<br/><br/>Vincent recently described himself in relation to players who may prefer a more low-impact approach:
<ul>Some roleplayers think that adversity is blocking. Throw adversity at them, they feel like you're blocking their creative input. Ask them to throw adversity at you, they won't do it.<br/><br/>But me, I have this character who I think is cool. I want to show off how cool she is and I want your help. What that means is, I want to show what she's made of and I want you to test her to breaking; I want you to do your worst and no screwing around. I want you to destroy her, tear her down, ruin her, shatter her, gut her...</ul>
Personally, I'm not very good at playing the way Vincent describes, possibly because I don't really like it all that much.  It just feels like a testosterone soap opera, and I just don't want to get into that kind of thing.  I realize there's a lot of good stuff being done here, and I enjoy hearing about these games and reading about design work in this area, but it's just not where my interests are and I don't think that's going to change anytime soon.  I'm not being a hater.  I'm not saying that kind of play is bad (though I'm sure people will feel the need to come out of the woodwork and defend it now), but it's just not for me.<br/><br/>Here's Thomas Robertson, with some interesting things to say:
<ul>It seems to me that we're dealing with two fundamentally different ways of approaching gaming as a hobby.<br/><br/>On the one hand we have the "traditional" indie movement which is about, in an important sense, universalizing play experiences. The goal is for anyone to be able to pick up (for instance) Dogs in the Vineyard and be able to have roughly the same experience as anyone else. Of course there are differences, but they're supposed to be akin to the differences of two different games of chess. Same form, different content.<br/><br/>On the other hand we have people who are about making play less universal. These people are about making play personal to the group. New players must be taught socially the rules of the game because those rules aren't written down, and they certainly aren't universal. This looks, to me, like the description of a lot of play in the 80's.<br/><br/>I think that part of the indie movement grew out of the desire to get away from that sort of play because not everyone finds it fun. But in the rush to abandon the "this sucks" extremely private (to specific groups) form of play, the indie movement left behind those who actually enjoyed what they were doing.</ul>
And WiredNavi bring up another good point, which rings true with my own experience:
<ul>I don't think that the difference between these groups is really universal experience vs. non-universal. That seems to be the effect. In my experience, though, the online freeformers really want consensus roleplaying. That is, they don't want to have conflicts between players at all, even.<br/><br/>The people I roleplayed with online were not interested in resolving their conflicts in a fair and interesting manner. The best game was one where everyone was riffing off of everyone else, and everyone was into everyone else's ideas to the extent that those conflicts simply didn't happen. Characters came into conflict all the time, but players avoided it.<br/><br/>This is in direct contrast to the indie RPG scene, which is very much about making rules for resolving conflict between the players. This is pretty diametrically opposed to what I think those players want.</ul>
I think Emily Care Boss' Breaking the Ice is a good example of a game that stands in the middle of these two competing sets of interests and tries to get both their attentions.  Still, when Selene Tan and I tried to play a Shojo ninja romance version of Breaking the Ice, the rules of the game kept clashing with the kind of play we had in mind.  Breaking tries to use die rolls and various pre-determined character traits to structure a couple's first three dates, but instead of us following the rules to determine where the story was going, we kept running on ahead with the story we wanted to tell, dragging the rules behind us as an afterthought.  We didn't really need or want the rules to help us structure scenes, figure out what was going to happen next, or create interesting conflicts.  We could do all that on our own.  We were totally rocking hard on the genre tropes we were borrowing, hit the ground running, and only later thought, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Oh, maybe we should have rolled some dice by now.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Silly freeformers!  How do you design to support the kind of play that Selene and I wanted to be doing?  Can it be done at all?<br/><br/>Some answers coming in the next installment:<br/><br/><b>A New Anthem, Part 2:<br/>Designing a Community of Practice</b><br/><br/>- Conversational Narrative<br/>- Constraint<br/>- Pull<br/>- Lessons from Game Chef                        </div>

                            Interesting... good read, so far. Some of this stuff really resonates with me. To be honest, some of the indie games out there... I don't "get". Some I do. But most of the time, I'd veer toward this style of play. And I think my game Eldritch Ass Kicking is close in style to this, because there are some strategic elements, but they are minimal. Overall, your point is to make a cool character and do things that show how cool he/she is.                        </div>

                            I suppose it boils down to what kind of game you want your roleplaying game to be.  Do you want it to be a dice-and-counters game, or do you want it to be a  game of social interactions?<br/>
<br/>
I never liked games of social interaction -- to me, they all boil down to popularity contests powered by hidden agendas and duplicity (not to put it lightly or anything).                        </div>

                            Fred,<br/><br/>Nothing. But one of the big issues with the "everyone in this game plays just this game" stance is that it does cut you off from support and external feedback mechanisms. Being specific to ones local environment is good, but being isolated rarely is. (Speaking in terms of cultural studies, at least.) <br/><br/>Which, I think, is where Johnathan may be going with his "community of practice" -- a way to make some sustainable forward progression in an otherwise moribund movement without sacrificing the individuality that makes the stance what it is. <br/><br/>Jonathan, <br/><br/>I have a lot to say about your posts. Some of it very much in agreement, some of it chopping off your dangly bits and feeding them to wolves. However none of it is fully clear yet, and so I'm going to wait to see the rest of your series before I start giving you heavy feedback. <br/><br/>Cool?                        </div>

                            People who play freeform are NOT cut off from support an external feedback mechanisms.  They just get it from different places than RPG players do.<br/>
<br/>
The Freeform RPG movement is alive and well and no more "moribund" than the RPG movement is.<br/>
<br/>
I think it's completely FRUITLESS to wonder how someone can design RPG's that will appeal to the freeformers.  It's like trying to design a artillery piece that will appeal to soccer moms, by reducing the bore to 37mm and putting a hitch on it that'll fit an SUV.<br/>

                            Fred, <br/><br/>Sorry, my fault for not being specific. <br/><br/>I didn't mean that the freeform community proper was moribund -- it isn't, and the Israeli groups (for example) show that. <br/><br/>The moribund groups are the groups that are playing D&amp;D to run their (honestly) freeform game while claiming they are playing D&amp;D. The ones who are neither left nor right, but floating somewhere in the middle. The ones whom, I would suspect, the now hardcore of the freeform and Forge groups were playing in (and miserable in) five years ago. <br/><br/>Most freeformers I know of are doing fine. Most macho-nar-yangers I know are doing fine too. But the folks in the middle are like armadillos on the road.<br/><br/>As for designing rules: that isn't what I said. "Community of practice" is not "rules set." It isn't even in the same universe.                        </div>

                            I don't agree, Vax.<br/><br/>I think a lot of low-impact/freeform players would prefer to have a minimal set of rules that worked for what they want to do. It's just that they haven't found any that fit the bill.                        </div>

                            Mike, you're under the impression that freeformers don't use rules.<br/>
<br/>
They do.<br/>
<br/>
They just don't pay money for them.<br/>
<br/>
The rules have titles like "No god-moding" and "I will not abandon you" and "No Jedi" and "This game is PG-13".<br/>
<br/>
They HAVE rules that work just great for what they want to do.<br/>
<br/>
Brand, the groups that are gradually dying out while they cling to DnD and play freeform... what's needed to reach them isn't the right ruleset, it's marketing.                        </div>

                            I have been a GM in a number of rpgs without dice and written rules, and it have been lots of fun.

<b>Kuma</b>, and earlier version of this was posted here:<br/><a href="http://thou-and-one.blogspot.com/2006/03/beginnings-of-structured-freeform.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://thou-and-one.blogspot.com/2006/03/beginnings-of-structured-freeform.html</a><br/><br/><b>Vax</b>, you're being rather unhelpful here.  Sure, you can play freeform without using a published set of rules specifically created for doing that.  You just make up some guidelines with your player group and off you go.  You could also play an RPG without using a published set of rules.  You just make up some rules with your player group and off you go.  Your insistance that people who want to play freeform can already do it without any design help is totally bogus.  I mean, sure they can, but if they do it with design help, they'll be able to do all sorts of neat things that they might not have thought of on their own.  Which is, like, the whole point of design.  That's like saying "Why write more RPGs? We already have plenty!"  You're rushing to defend the existing freeform community and completely missing the point.<br/><br/><b>Nathan</b>, I don't have any experience with Eldritch Ass Kicking, so I don't know whether your designs drift towards this style of play or not.  I think a lot of people have been looking for games that do this for a LONG time, but designers haven't quite figured out how to effectively create them yet.<br/><br/><b>Joshua</b>, I don't think the mental image you have of the type of play I'm imagining is especially accurate.  "Popularity contests powered by hidden agendas and duplicity" don't really interest me at all and saying that all social interactions boil down to that seems pretty limiting.  Have you read Mo's descriptions of "Push"?  Have you read <a href="http://thou-and-one.blogspot.com/2006/01/kazekami-kyoko-kills-kublai-khan.html" rel="nofollow">KKKKK</a> (which is a limited view of the kind of play I'm imagining, but in the same ballpark)?<br/><br/><b>Brand</b>, righto.  While I understand you wanting to hold back on the cheers and emasculation until I say my piece, part of the reason I'm posting stuff and trying to get these conversations started is so I can figure out how best to articulate the point I'm trying to make.  So way to abstain from being helpful!  What am I gonna do without Brand quotes to...uh, quote?  Go ahead and emasculate me so I can maybe avoid the knives later.<br/><br/><b>Mike</b>, indeed, but Brand's definitely right that thinking about "minimalist rules-sets" is not really the tree I'm currently barking up.  People have tried that in the past and we got, like, Fudge and Nobilis and Amber and Blue Rose and PTA and The Pool.  Which are great games, but not what I'm looking for.  I'd talk more about designing a "community of practice" but I'd rather tackle that particular issue when I get to it in the next section.  It's gonna be a little tricky.                        </div>

                            Jonathan, a good community can play in this way without devolving into popularity contests and duplicity, sure.  My GM Herbie can run anything in any system, too.<br><br>What I have never seen in lots of years of doing a lot of this kind of roleplaying is a system composed of social rules that isn't totally and profoundly vulnerable to prima donnas exploiting the other players by being less than forthcoming about what they really care about and how much they care about it.  I in fact know some people who go from game to game online wreaking havoc in exactly this way, 'gaming' things to make the other players dance like puppets on strings.<br/><br/>It's the nature of the form that this behavior is not only easily obscured, but it is protected and even systemicly encouraged.  If I'm faced with a social situation where I can either be polite, honest, and unempowered or I can be scheming, lying, and powerful, I have no incentive to take the noble and high-minded path.  This is especially compounded by the fact that in these scenarios my chances of success are ridiculously high and the chances of the other players ever finding out are ridiculously low.<br/><br/>And, of course, with everybody constantly looking at just that option available to them, once one player goes down that route, the others must follow in order to protect themselves.  This chain reaction can even occur if one player <em>suspects</em> another player of exploiting the social situation, and therefore begins exploiting things to counteract the perceived transgression.<br/><br/>Tangentially, I think this is why Vampire has flourished in such an environment -- all of the above is part and parcel of what Vampire is all about!                        </br></br></div>

                            Joshua, I think that in some ways you're kind of right, in that there are players that can steamroll a 'social' system easily (I think it's equally possible to steamroll a 'mechanical' system, but that's neither here nor there), but I think that leads into a very important aspect of this style of play, which I think Jonathan articulated fairly well:<br/>
<br/>
"This group understands that most mechanics can be replaced by a solid social contract, playing with the right people, and building a strong shared history of play with the others in the group."<br/>
<br/>
I don't play with people I don't trust.  This isn't necessarily the sort of game you can just pick up and play with anyone.<br/>
<br/>
Tangentially, I think that this is why a lot of people who gravitate to this style are often resistant to gm-less styles of gaming, because you have to trust more people more deeply in that kind of game; it's not impossible, but it can be more difficult to accomplish.                        </div>

                            I'll concede the point, but what I've never understood is how you get to that point of trust with your fellow players -- is it done outside the game, so you only play this with folks you know?

<p>So, I'm getting the impression - please correct me if I'm wrong - that this trust factor is a double-edged sword.</p>
<p>It permits you to do different and special things in play, but it also sets a barrier between groups; you have a trust relationship with the people you always play with, but what about those other people over there that are doing the same thing? You don't know them well enough to play with them yet.</p>
<p>So, thing is, I'm interested (intellectually) in seeing what this kind of play is like; I don't have a group with those practices and that trust relationship.</p>
<p>Can that gap be bridged?</p>

                            To echo Shreyas, if I wanted to up and join a group like that, would it only be a success to the extent that I conformed to the play styles and expectations of the others in the group? <br/><br/>It seems to me that if I tried to bring my own style and preferences to a group that operated via solid social contract, I could be told "You're doing it wrong" or "you're spoiling the game", and by these criteria, they'd be justified to do so. If so, this seems a bit iffy.<br/>[edit: that is, that I would have no authority to defend my behaviour, as there are no mechanics to support me doing what I want to do, with all/most authority coming from the group consensus.]<br/><br/><br/>That said, maybe the point of this thread is that these kind of issues can and should be designed away.                        </div>

                            Augh.  We're too used to thinking of 'rules' as mechanisms to affect the SIS (to use an ancient term), mechanisms that decide who gets what authority to narrate which things.  These people don't want rules like that; they don't want to argue at all, much less have rules to preside over such arguments.  They need rules to:<br/>
<br/>
A) Collate the group's playstyle so that the boundaries of play can be absorbed rapidly and comprehensively, and possibly set individual boundaries as well<br/>
B) Come to consensus rapidly and painlessly instead of apportioning authority<br/>
C) Help players suggest ways to guide narration in acceptable directions without sacrificing interest and excitement<br/>
<br/>
Most freeformers in my experience want to push their own buttons instead of having others do it for them.  That is, they want NGH play except when they decide to hurt themselves, and that's when.  I think rules for this kind of play would have a lot of explicit flags, which are already used a lot online in character descriptions and just need to be extended farther, and some kind of story-structure guide where players can easily 'slot' new characters into good positions in existing relationship maps.                        </div>

                            Speaking as a freeformer (among other things), I think systems like this are a good idea. I've played games in several traditional forms of Freeform as well as Consensus games and All-GM games (All-GM refers to games where no one can contradict anything anyone else brings into play, and are a story of their own), and when I get right down to it I prefer having a low impact system to lean back on. Sure, I can do everything myself, but it's easier to use tools if they're right for the job.<br/>
<br/>
What I'm saying is, anyone who says that there is no audience for the type of games Jon's talking about is just wrong.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for the trust issue - Joshua asks how you get to the point of trust with your fellow players. Mostly, you build this trust like you build any kind of trust. Often this would mean playing with people that you already know and trust, which is especially easier in a close-knit community setting (I have several dozen roleplayers that I played with and "trust", for example, which makes putting groups together easier). This trust also works by connection - I'm playing with two people I know and played with before and they bring in someone they've played with before. The trust-building is much easier then both because we have the same basic gaming norms and because we have facilitators.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, the game itself is a trust building mechanism. Yes, if I'm playing with a completely unfamiliar group we're not going to jump into the deep water right away, but roleplaying is one of the more personal experiences and as such bonds people fairly quickly. This doens't help you if you're just doing a one-shot with people you haven't met before and never will again, but is invaluable in the long-range.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, there is the issue of common ground. Like I've mentioned I've recently been drawn into a game with an unfamiliar player. But, because we speak the same language and are used to the same norms, not just on the mechanical level of the game but the social as well, I found it was very easy to include that player in the "trust" the game required. In this case we both have the same norms because we grew up in the same gaming environment, but Jon's essay makes me wonder if such a thing can be artificially approximated.                        </div>

                            To follow up on what Peaseblossom and Nir Shiffer have said. I only game with people I trust. New games often have new faces which means each new game is often a trust exercise at the beginning on top of everything else. If the trust can't be built, a rare thing but it happens, not every group you create necessarily works even if you've gamed with everyone before, than the game usually ends one way or another. <br/>
<br/>
Because gaming ends up being such a  trust building exercise it also serves as a community building exercise.                        </div>

                            Jonathon, what I'm most interested here is the set of rules. <br/>
<br/>
Interesting though the discussion is, I think it boils down to "Should there be a set of rules for these sort of people?". It's hard to answer that question. But if there was a set of rules, that would give something definite to criticize.<br/>

                            Jonathon,<br/>
    Given your description of the desires of these folks, I'd count myself among the group you are trying to design for.  I've never done freefrom, but my games have drifted closer and closer to it over the years (I tend to systems like Everway and OTE, or my latest darling Wushu  for tabletop play).  I find most of the Forge style games way too "mechanical" and "in your face" for my desired style of play, and find that the emphasis on thematically reinforcing mechanics just breaks my SOD and ruins the experience of the "story" for me.<br/>
<br/>
     I for one would love to see a set of techniques for facilitating this kind of play, particularly for face to face tabeltop play.<br/>

                            I find the whole idea of Geek Social Fallacies to be an odd-bit of self-hatred as its mainly used in geek and gamer circles. Truth is these are behaviors of most self-identified communities and are not encessarily good or bad in themselves. <br/>
<br/>
I also feel that bringing it up in this context is an attempt to deflect from the <br/>
pertinent issue of what exactly is system and how does it apply to this style of gaming.                        </div>

                            Jonathon, you almost make me sound like some rules-hating freeform yanger! ;) And this just as I post about how great tactical-crunchy D&amp;D is!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it *is* interesting because I'm really not much of a freeformer. I've tried, vaguely, to get into it online, mostly in forums and chats/MUDs. The only thing I succeeded in doing was feeling really awkward and out of place. Then I go play Breaking the Ice with Jonathon and we end up forgetting to use the rules. So what gives?<br/>
<br/>
Things that did not work for me in my other online experiences:<br/>
- Too much stupid backstory stuff to catch up on<br/>
- Not enough guidance about what I was allowed or expected to do ("Do anything your character would do" does not count as guidance for me.)<br/>
- Muddy scenery/NPC ownership (Yeah, I can control my character, but what else can I control? Do I get to say I walk into a bar when one hasn't previously been established? Who knows!)<br/>
- "No, I don't like mentally masturbating in public. Am I allowed to do anything else here?" *looks at other posts* "Maybe not..."<br/>
- "Why don't I just, you know, write a story and not subject myself to all this social stuff?"<br/>
- "Who are these people anyway?? I'm starting to get creeped out!"<br/>
<br/>
Things that worked for me playing with Jonathon:<br/>
- Collaborative setting/situation/character creation before play -- basically, we spent a fair amount of time getting on the same page. And using Breaking the Ice meant there was something concrete to strive for.<br/>
- Tacit "Director Stance is A-OK!"<br/>
- I have talked with him previously in non-roleplaying contexts<br/>
- There was a non-stupid system to fall back to if "just roleplaying" didn't work<br/>
<br/>
The first two features of playing with Jonathon cleared up the first three problems I'd previously encountered online. Of course, I'm sure there are freeformers who will look at me and go "But that's not the pooooint!" Oh well!                        </div>

                            Johnathon, <br/>
<br/>
I'd like to just add my thoughts about low impact design.<br/>
<br/>
I have unfocused players who are anti-freeformers. They want to be led around the game-world soaking in the color and challenge. Aside from a limited set-up effort in character creation, they want no part of author stance. At all. No 'inventing' a bar to walk into and no input or meta-control of anything outside their characters's person, much less creating their nemesis or controling npcs for the GM. And they aren't interested in exploring personal issues or being part of a 'story' except as it appears by happenstance in hindsight. Just as strongly, they don't care for counting arrows or managing resources of any kind. But they aren't free-forming and they have no specific creative agenda. They really like GURPS and D&amp;D3, especially choosing ads and feats.<br/>
<br/>
BUT they can be designed for. They want just enough system to know what they can do and nothing that will force them to do anything more than their whims lead them. As an example, D&amp;D3 is just about right - they can (say) ignore or use the challenge rating system as they want, even within the same combat. I see this group as being made up of by mass-market gamers.<br/>
<br/>
I said all of that for this...which is going to sound far simpler than I know it to be:<br/>
<br/>
I think you can appeal to low impact gamers by designing in their favorite bits for them to sink their teeth into. I'm talking about equipment lists, short fiction bits, mood-evoking art, some archetypes or templates and game-world flags (like Vampire Clans.) Just enough system and pretty things to direct their individual gaming efforts into a group effort. Then SELL it. These players want to be sold. Like their favorite GMs sell them into a game. (That might read more uncharitably than I meant it when typing it up, but hopefully you all understand that I am okay with the fact that they play this way, even if I don't want to GM it.)<br/>
<br/>
But I get the feeling that my view is probably too narrow. I want to see what else there is to say about low impact design. When is part 2 coming?<br/>
<br/>
Chris W.<br/>
<br/>
Note that I personally think that a little more examination (in creation and periodically) would produce better play, especially as regards flags and collaboration. Playing without these things leads to especially inconsistent results, in my experience.                        </div>

Here's the sort of comments I could expect from my players:<br/>

And here's some uninspired (non flag) play just for illustration:<br/>

IMO, low impact play is uncluttered and straightforward. Not much in the way of grey areas.<br/>

                            Sorry I've not been around to be more active in these discussions, but I just returned from 2 1/2 days in DC and I'm leaving tomorrow to drive down to Tampa.  Life is nuts!<br/><br/>I think (like Graham and Paul suggested) many of the issues that have been brought up here will be easier to discuss once I post the second mini essay, but I wanted to address the Shreyas/Alex "I don't have a group of people that I trust that way!  What now?" problem.  <br/><br/>Obviously, there are many different levels of trust here.  Personally, I think trust is actually less important than a degree of personal familiarity.  If you've spent a fair amount of time conversing with someone, either in person or online, you should have a fair sense of how they're going to behave in most social situations.  Sure, they could still do something that shocks and surprises you, but it's less likely the more contact you've had with them ("Oh, Shreyas is just having one of his 'I hate everything and everyone' days...").  If you have a sort of personable relationship with someone, I think that's enough to play these type of games with them.  I mean, it's not like Selene and I have spent hours and hours conversing online.  But we've had enough little conversations that we had no problem running off on a crazy freeform rampage.  <br/><br/>And sometimes it has to do with individual people.  If you begin talking with people and a lot of things just click, if you have a lot of the same instincts and get pushed by the same buttons, it's probably easier to jump right into supporting each other in play.  There's less need for a lot of socialization time.  I've never played with Jess or Nir or WiredNavi or Annie before, but the way we think about play has so much in common that I'm sure we could just jump right in and have a blast.  And, if you have the right kind of person, who intuitively gets what low-impact play is about, you don't even have to know them that well, honestly.  Play is certainly more efficient and effective if you know the other players well, but it's not actually necessary.  Like, I can imagining walking around GenCon with a sign reading "Did you heart <i>Changeling</i>?" and finding people I could start up a low-impact game with, all in about 10 minutes.<br/><br/>As for joining an existing play group, in order for that to succeed, the group really has to incorperate you into their processes.  Yes, you'll probably have to adapt more to the guidelines they've already established, but, since the group wants you to enjoy the game and be a real part of the group too, they'll also have to adapt to your needs and desires.  Think about joining a basketball or baseball team or an acting troupe.  If it's going to be a successful working relationship, often both sides have to change the way they do things so the group as a whole can be better.<br/><br/>Finally, this all goes back to CAREFULLY CHOOSING WHO YOU PLAY WITH, which is actually one of the precepts of indie gaming that I most strongly agree with, even if it's not gotten as much attention of late.  You're not going to be able to play these games with just anyone, even if you really want to play with them.  Sometimes the mix of people or personalities or interests just won't work.  And recognizing that and knowing when to walk away (or who should walk away) is one of the hardest parts.  Still, I've NEVER had problems getting a group of people together for low-impact or freeform play.  Those players are EVERYWHERE.  I have, in the past, just drafted whoever was sitting around my college dorm lounge.  I HAVE had problems recruiting groups to play Unknown Armies or Nobilis or In Nomine or Continuum, because, like Selene says, those require you to know much more backstory or system in order to play effectively.<br/><br/>Anyway, there's my long response to a side point.  Now I have to pack for Florida.  Once I get down there and get through my first few days of teaching class, I'll try to finish up the second mini essay so we can have some real content to talk about.                        </div>

                            I'm glad you resurrected this, for whatever reason I glossed over it the first time. ("TL;DR" --- because I'm an idiot ). Between the original post and Dee's evaluation I wish there was something I could add. I think there is some way to "reach the freeformers". In fact, as Dee points out there are a ton of "mainstream" gamers that are not that far removed from what freeformers do. But this is just what I think based on a gut feeling of participating in a ton of "freeform" and near-freeform games, I can't find a line, I really can't, every time I think I find one, I am wrong and stupid. So there's got to be a way. But hell if I can think of it.                        </div>
