In said disk would be a comprehensive collection of the whole design process, including: a design diary, forum transcripts, audio recordings of AP and playtest sessions, each and every version from playtest to finished product with designer's notes on what did/didn't work and why, pictures and video from conventions, etc.  This would obviously be something that you would have to plan to do from the beginning (not because it would be that much extra work, more so that you remember to keep all the materials in one place and remember to get permissions along the way).<br/><br/>Has anyone done this in the past?<br/><br/>Is this something that is viable to do?<br/><br/>Is this something people would be interested in?<br/>(I know other design diaries and "secret histories" have been warmly received online)<br/><br/>Is this something that people would pay extra for in terms of a deluxe edition?<br/><br/>[note] I'm not designing anything, if you like the idea, please steal it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83" title="Jumanji83"><img alt="Jumanji83" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83">Jumanji83</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286705/#Comment_286705" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T09:49:39+00:00" title="August 16, 2010  9:49AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that's a neat idea, especially if done in an entertaining way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286746/#Comment_286746" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T11:14:51+00:00" title="August 16, 2010 11:14AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea of a bonus disk, but I don't think I'd be particularly attracted by any of the things you've mentioned as potential items on that disk. When it comes to CDs glued into the back of manuals, I like to see stuff like background music, PDF files of useful stuff like character sheets, sample NPCs or example adventures and player handouts in case you don't want to damage your book photocopying it, maybe art to use on my computer's desktop or utilities to make playing the game easier. Design notes are nice and all, but they don't really grab me as being a must-have.<br/><br/>Still, I'll happily note that I may not be typical of your target market. I rarely watch DVD extras for instance. I'm more interested in the game as it stands than how it came to be, despite being a game designer myself.

You could probably also format it such that you have the in-game and out-of-game conversations together in side-by-side and synchronized such that the columns illustrate how the mechanics are driving the action/dialogue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286756/#Comment_286756" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T11:42:34+00:00" title="August 16, 2010 11:42AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A CD or DVD could have short videos that teach you how to play.

They seem to be pretty hot in terms of audience reaction, but I personally find the lack of context a bit frustrating and wish I could listen to the full sessions rather than just the summary they give. <br><br>I'd personally love to see a conversation somewhere about what people do or don't like about AP podcasts, since there seems to be a lot of variation in things like how tightly they are edited, etc., and most of the criticisms of the format that I've seen seem to be blanket dismissals rather than critiques.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286867/#Comment_286867" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T18:54:21+00:00" title="August 16, 2010  6:54PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The reason I included AP as a possibility was that, if you were recording all the playtest sessions, then you would probably capture some really good sessions.  An AP would allow the designer to either showcase the best case gameplay, the real gaming gold, or allow the designer to share a demo in which he/she runs the game "the way its supposed to be."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286874/#Comment_286874" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T20:22:50+00:00" title="August 16, 2010  8:22PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Music CD would be great.
