There will be 5 players, none of whom are big anime fans, all pretty open to trying new things and with a pretty wide range of experience with RPGs.  There has been a lot of skepticism from this group towards my enthusiasm for Maid, so this is kind of a chance for me to prove how awesome wacky randomness in a cool set-up can be.  I'm also going to keep it PG-rated.<br/><br/>I think what I would like is to ensure that all the players have fairly clear goals for their PCs and have that structure the overall story arc while random craziness happens.  Do you have any suggestions for those goals?  Can it be as simple as "do your job"? or should I have something slightly more directed or even different goals or each made (player chosen perhaps)?<br/><br/>It also seems fun to roll up the setting, mansion and master right there at the table.  Is that fun?  Or should I have a bit more set-up structure built ahead of time?<br/><br/>Any other input would be most helpful!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jlcsusara" title="jlcsusara"><img alt="jlcsusara" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jlcsusara">jlcsusara</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274426/#Comment_274426" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-04T03:39:02+00:00" title="June  4, 2010  3:39AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We tried a Maid game on IRC...

Instead, I usually come to the table with at least a tiny bit of a scenario in my head. For example, a common one I like to run is: The master is a young, kinda sheepish and pure boy of about 13-15 years old. His parents are out of town often.<br/><br/>The local Yakuza boss shows up with a bunch of goons, with a signed piece of paper stating that the kid's parents lost the mansion to him when gambling, and that as of midnight tomorrow night the mansion will be theirs. The master's parents are the kind of jetsetter folks who would do something like that without telling their kid or remembering that he's even there, so it's legit. It's up to the maids (the players) to figure out how to save the mansion.<br/><br/>So I usually begin the game with a "OK, day in the life. Master's going to be home from school soon: What are you doing?" And go around the table. Bust into play quickly that way for about 5-10 minutes, with the players competing for favor. Then, BOOM, the yakuza plot begins. By that time you've got enough energy to carry the game for 2-3+ hours, or a little more if the players use random events from there.<br/><br/>So I usually go in with a master, a feel for a mansion (and the setting, usually modern), a general plot and a few NPC or possible event descriptions... all this could probably fit on one notecard. Then I rely on the players to carry the rest.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277647/#Comment_277647" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-24T06:43:46+00:00" title="June 24, 2010  6:43AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A bit of a ressurection, but I've been really busy and am only now starting my prep.

From there, I can deal with totally random Maid characters with various abilities and backgrounds, plus the randomness of action and events tables, building off the above foundation.<br/><br/>I've done about 3 sessions where I DID go in and roll random master, random setting/mansion, and begin the game with random events: All three sessions were *ok*: They didn't suck nor were they boring, but honestly they weren't that great either IMO. Likely my own flaws there, but after coming up with the methodology of "solid foundation, explode from there into randomness", each session has been really fun, even the "overloaded with players" (6-8) one-shots at cons and stuff.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277691/#Comment_277691" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-24T11:32:23+00:00" title="June 24, 2010 11:32AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played Maid once and run it once. Both times, we randomly generated everything on the spot (one hour creation, two hours play), and both times it was crazy-gonzo fun.<br/><br/>I had a great example in Jake Richmond. He really showed me how to keep events hopping, inject momentum and humor into the Favor economy, and play the Master with verve.<br/><br/>Ben's right, for random generation do everything out loud and keep everyone talking about it. When fortuitous combinations come up draw attention to them! We had a maid who was Sexy and Pure, and then rolled Succubus! Haha, an innocent sex demon! Oh wait, we rolled that she's an orphan adopted by the Master's family? Now it all makes sense! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>This keeps Master/mansion generation from being a bore as well. Oh, I rolled that the mansion is a shop of some kind? Geez, what kind of shop could it be? Oh, I rolled that it has a tennis court! Of course, it must be a ritzy tennis club! With an otherworldly portal! And a Master who's a 13 year old Sorcerer and world conqueror! It's all starting to come together!<br/><br/>I wasn't quite as aggressive in soliciting player input as Ben described, but that's a great idea. In any case, just make sure that the random generation is FUN, like <i>OMG what are we gonna GET?!</i> and not a chore, and you'll be fine. If, however, you're like Andy and need a little scenario direction to get your wheels turning, that should be fine too. I've got a random Master/Mansion I rolled up at home once (a 13-year-old invalid Lich who presides over a high-tech Post-Apocalyptic prison with a Hard-Life mood), that I'd love to use sometime.<br/><br/>With Favor, yeah, be arbitrary and be funny! Keep Favor flowing rapidly and make it clear that the Master is not being fair or logical at ALL. Draw humorous implications from which actions incur more Favor: is it bringing him his breakfast, or bringing him his <i>booze</i>? Is it the person who performs the task WELL, or the one who's cutest while screwing up? I personally forgot to dock Favor, but I remember Jake did, to good effect. Don't make it "punishment for bad playing," just make it a cruel wind of fortune that the players don't need to worry about (the Maids can worry PLENTY!) because it'll soon blow the other way.<br/><br/>For playing the Master, keep the Maids hopping to (all that stuff about Favor applies, of course), and make him capricious and arbitrary (though perhaps cheerfully so, not cruelly), but also pretty incompetent and stupid. If his desires and whims make no sense then it takes the edge off of the servitude angle, because he's just this madman you have to cope with. And often it'll be the Maids that have to come up with a coherent and sensible plan--or just deliberately sabotage things! Which reminds me, the Maid Roots are super-important. They give the Maids an assortment of motivation outside of Commands, which can be the driving force of the plot, or at the very least create a fun friction between the Master's desires or their own. That's not really in your hands, the players really have to drive that--but I always point them out as a central part of play.<br/><br/>The above paragraph applies for a default sort of Master, primed for max humor potential. If you get a different combination of traits, or just want to play it a certain way, then modify to taste, of course. The Master could be shy and gentle, like Andy describes, or he could be older, Baroque and elegant (oh, and don't forget that the Master can be female! I want to try a female Master for my next game). In that case I have no direct play advice. maybe Andy can share with us how he plays his shy  Yakuza-afflicted kid. I suspect that veering from "bold, arbitrary and dumb" makes it harder to drive toward humorous play, but that might be OK for you. In the end I guess just decide what kind of personality you can play effortlessly and with style.<br/><br/>Good luck!<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277712/#Comment_277712" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-24T13:29:27+00:00" title="June 24, 2010  1:29PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great stuff.

I think I gave out 20 like, one time, for something appropriately dramatic or funny. I really had no idea if this was a "balanced" amount or not; the Maids soon acquired impressive piles of the stuff, but then some of them needed it, having 0 scores, so they could either temporarily or permanently buy points to be able to attempt something at all (if you have 0 in something you just can't succeed in that area). Overall I'm glad I gave out enough to let players feel free in spending it. There's few things more of a drag than resource hoarding in a one-shot.<br/><br/>Good luck and have fun!<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278069/#Comment_278069" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-26T14:02:54+00:00" title="June 26, 2010  2:02PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jlcsusara</cite>We tried a Maid game on IRC...
