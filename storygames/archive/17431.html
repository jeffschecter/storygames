You have posted elsewhere on the awesome that is this game.<br/><br/>And I want to know what kind of mechanical changes you are making.  Do you have a character sheet you can scan in maybe?<br/><br/>Also, I've tried this game a few times now, because it does have an impressive lineage and list of inspirations, but can't seem to make it work.   I want to know specifically:<br/><br/>how you build <i>your</i> dice-pools<br/>how you use <i>trust</i><br/>how you divide <i>actions</i> and <i>rounds</i><br/><br/>And also, the intersection of those three.  I've always been turned off by the vagueries of what "Aiding" or "Helping" or "Co-operating" or "Trusting" are and which are appropriate when.  How does all that work in <i>your</i> game?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394622/#Comment_394622" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-24T11:01:37+00:00" title="October 24, 2012 11:01AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am looping Scott into this conversation, but it may be a couple hours before he replies, because he's getting ready to run another kickass Hot War session for me!

Hot War uses Relationships instead, which are less about trust and betrayal and more about building up networks in a society that's collapsing. I tend to use Hot War as the basis for hacks, as it fits more situations. That said, Steve Ellis has had a lot of success with running Battlestar Gallactica games using Cold City, as the idea of Trust fits the source material perfectly.<br/><br/><a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2192911/Taylor-S-Compton.pdf" rel="nofollow">Here's one of the character sheets</a> from The Sea, Our Mother. The changes I've made to default Hot War are:<br/><br/>1) I've removed the idea of Factions, as they don't fit in a game where not everyone is a member of an organisation.<br/><br/>2) Factional and Personal Agendas have been replaced by Duty and Desire. They function in the same way, but Duty is defined more as something that you feel that you owe to other people or the world, and Desire is what you want purely for yourself.<br/><br/>3) There is a Madness/Monstrousness track, ranging from 1 to 5. This is a resource that characters can draw on, but runs a risk of destroying their minds. If you bring Madness into a roll and one of the dice for it comes out top, your Madness goes up by one and you flip out a bit. You can spend two points of Consequence to put someone's Madness up by 1, or 3 to max it out. If someone hits 5, they become completely unhinged and a force of destruction.<br/><br/>4) Relationships are no longer positive or negative, only having intensities. The idea is that the description of the Relationship dictates how it can be used in a conflict. You can spend two points of Consequence to rewrite the description of a Relationship.<br/><br/>You build the dice pools by first deciding whether it's a physical, social or intellectual conflict, and using Action, Influence or Insight as the basis. You then decide if an Agenda applies (only one can be used in a conflict) and use the bonus as extra dice. Next, you look at your Traits and pick the ones that apply, taking a die for each; both positive and negative traits give you dice, but negative ones will bring down related trouble if they come up high in the roll. Finally, you take the dice for any Relationships that apply. <br/><br/>Optionally, you may also get dice if you have an appropriate tool in the conflict (like a gun for shooting someone). Other players may also suggest factors in the environment that affect the conflict, like poor visibility from the smoke of the burning building you're in, which can add or remove dice from either side.<br/><br/>All of this sounds complex, but by the time you've done it once or twice, it becomes very quick and obvious.<br/><br/>There are no rounds or actions as such. Each roll resolves an entire conflict, and you should set stakes accordingly. You may have a follow-up conflict almost immediately, but it should not be about the same thing; the result of the first roll needs to stand.<br/><br/>A player can choose to help either side in a conflict, by adding their appropriate stat and any Traits that apply; Agendas and Relationships cannot be used to help.<br/><br/>Cold City is quite different, in that the Trust mechanic allows you to choose to help or betray someone, adding or removing dice from their pool based on the amount of Trust their character has in yours.<br/><br/>Please let me know if any of this needs clarifying. It's a pretty big infodump!<br/><br/>Edit: If you fancy an online game of Hot War, let me know. I seem to be doing a lot of gaming on Google Hangouts at the moment, and I'd be happy to include you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394729/#Comment_394729" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-25T05:35:33+00:00" title="October 25, 2012  5:35AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All this makes sense, given what I've tried in the past.  <br/><br/>The thing that always threw me with the Trust bit was that it was always more useful to just, do something with someone and add your pools together than to Trust.  It only made mechanical sense to me if we broke things in to "rounds" and Player A was allowed to take an action, <i>and also</i> lend Trust dice because Player A's Action allowed Player B a moment's peace to take a separate action.<br/><br/>And then that granularity rubbed wrong against the rest of the game...<br/><br/>However, this looks hot.  That and the character sheet have given me a great idea of how it comes together.  Awesome work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/girolamo" title="girolamo"><img alt="girolamo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/427/nE75Q8GFK8R5Y.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/girolamo">girolamo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396003/#Comment_396003" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-03T01:14:42+00:00" title="November  3, 2012  1:14AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I totally agree with Harlequin here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396035/#Comment_396035" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-03T06:49:23+00:00" title="November  3, 2012  6:49AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I never played the game but a compliment on the writing of that gonzo journalism character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396173/#Comment_396173" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-04T06:46:03+00:00" title="November  4, 2012  6:46AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 4, 2012 6:46AM by Rafael.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Scott's characters are always awesome to play.
