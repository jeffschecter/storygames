Basically, something every 24 hours.  Sometimes a player won't have anything to submit--if, for example, you have no retreats required in the retreat phase.  So each year will take 3-5 days.  A sampling of recent finished games indicates they ended between Fall 1907 and Fall 1910--18-45 days of playing time--for some, anyway.   Gunboat games take longer.  <br><br>And let's take Eero's suggestion and make Game 6 a Gunboat game.  That means no communication and no press for the players on the Diplomacy website.  Commentary about the game should take place here--but no negotiations.  <br><br>The game won't be anonymous, because user names are assigned to countries. But other than that it should work ok. It's a chance to see what you would do in the absence of negotiations.<br><br/>And, in terms of time commitment, games without negotiations may take longer, but potentially less time per day because players don't have to write back and forth to each other.  <br/><br/>Game 5 will still be available for those wanting to join the Diplomacy site.  I think membership is a donation.  I have no affiliation with the site!<br/><br/>Mel                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303315/#Comment_303315" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-05T12:31:15+00:00" title="December  5, 2010 12:31PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure I'm interested in a Gunboat game.

I've come to the conclusion that <b><i>Diplomacy</i></b> is an <i>instructive perversion</i>, in that it subverts the normal ethics of communication (saying what you mean, meaning what you say) to establish a situation in which the expectation of at least eventual deception is endemic and crazy-making--but also something that you can learn from if you're sufficiently attentive. Now, I recognize that the question of the extent to which strategic communication can be ethically validated is a complicated one--I've even <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2007.00311.x/abstract" rel="nofollow">written a paper about it</a>. And I'll concede that it's likely that the "magic circle" of the game implies that its players are maybe only <i>playing at</i> (ethically questionable) strategic communication, so I'm not anti-Diplomacy by any stretch of the imagination--shit, I'm signed up for Game 6--but let me just say that I'm aware of its ethical implications when I play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303462/#Comment_303462" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-06T13:39:34+00:00" title="December  6, 2010  1:39PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll sign up at an opportune moment later, never fear. Will we do a full gunboat (no communication at all) or allow public discussion? I'm cool with both, although open discussion might be more interesting with uneven skill levels. Gunboat tends to be pretty harsh in that regard, as there's no way for the strong player to share his tactical wisdom with the new face. In this regard normal Diplomacy is much more beginner-friendly, as theoretically the optimal game (according to my Diplomacy theory, anyway) requires the players to engage in maximum information sharing - somebody will always benefit of you playing your optimal game, so it's likely that somebody will tell you what to do even if you don't know yourself what would be a good move.<br/><br/>As for private messages, obviously none should be allowed, that's the whole point of gunboat. Makes no difference whether you use the in-game messaging system, SG forum messages, chat or go and meet the other player in person. No private communication means no private communication.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303473/#Comment_303473" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-06T14:51:51+00:00" title="December  6, 2010  2:51PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite><br/>I'll concede that it's likely that the "magic circle" of the game implies that its players are maybe only<i>playing at</i>(ethically questionable) strategic communication ...</blockquote>\nNot to get this planning thread off on idle, ivory-tower notions, but I would subscribe firmly to this interpretation.

Luckily for me, Willow is playing Russia, and we've seen her mettle as Germany in a previous game--she is a tough fighter. I will watch carefully to see if their moves portend the dreaded juggernaut, and if so call for aid from the West. Otherwise, I will throw in with the Power that moves most aggressively against the other and the least aggressively against me--to the extent that my powers of perception permit. My immediate neighbors to the west, Germany and Italy, are played by Peter and Paul (neither of whom I've played with before). To Peter, I say that I will as Austria, as in every game I've ever seen, stand back-to-back with you as a fellow central power, and hope that you will recognize how entwined are our interests in the early game. To Paul -- who has expressed some curiosity about how all this will work -- I will say that I have found it useful to consult the various on-line Diplomacy sites about openings as well as strategy and tactics (S&amp;T). Italy has a tough game to play, to be sure. I'm reminded of the commendation of Leonidas to his soldiers at Thermopylae: "Kadmos enjoins your largest efforts, pressed as never told of!" I look forward to a fascinating game between France and England. England is being played by Eero, whom we all know for his long experience and intimate mastery of the game; he is confronted with a player known to us only as "brains," or Calculus on <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23playnow--monikers&amp;Mode=like">#playnow--monikers</a> suggesting a laser-like focus on the logical, the rational, and the cerebral.

I've heard that Italy is, in many ways, the least desirable country, to the extent that some play a variant where Italy begins play with a fourth army in Tunis, for balance.

A Turkish Anti-Austrian opening will look pretty similar to all but the most aggressively anti-Russian openings (expect a move to secure Bulgaria, and either Ank-Bla or Ank-Con, with Smyrna either following to Con or pulling around to Arm.)  A good Turkish turn will end with Bulgaria, not threatening any of the Austrian homeland.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, I'll be aiming for Rumania, which is right on the doorstep of Budapest.<br/><br/>So in otherwords, all else being equal, "neutral" play from me is more threatening than that from the Turk.<br/><br/>As we Russians are a peace loving people, I wonder what it would take to garner cooperation from the Austrian in leaving Rumania alone and allowing us to see how the Balkans shake out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304076/#Comment_304076" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-12T12:55:14+00:00" title="December 12, 2010 12:55PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 12, 2010 1:01PM by DWeird.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite><cite>Posted By: Mel White</cite>Some, if not all of the openings Bill mentions are here:<a href="http://www.diplom.org/Online/Openings/" rel="nofollow">Diplomacy Openings Library</a></blockquote>\nOh, dear.

Already I feel embattled and overwhelmed. I notice my that old friend Daumantas and I have reversed positions from our last game, where he was Austria and I was Turkey. Luckily for me, Willow is playing Russia, and we've seen her mettle as Germany in a previous game--she is a tough fighter. I will watch carefully to see if their moves portend the dreaded juggernaut, and if so call for aid from the West. Otherwise, I will throw in with the Power that moves most aggressively against the other and the least aggressively against me--to the extent that my powers of perception permit.</blockquote>\nThat does seem a bit harsh against me.  A Turkish Anti-Austrian opening will look pretty similar to all but the most aggressively anti-Russian openings (expect a move to secure Bulgaria, and either Ank-Bla or Ank-Con, with Smyrna either following to Con or pulling around to Arm.)  A good Turkish turn will end with Bulgaria, not threatening any of the Austrian homeland.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, I'll be aiming for Rumania, which is right on the doorstep of Budapest.<br/><br/>So in otherwords, all else being equal, "neutral" play from me is more threatening than that from the Turk.<br/><br/>As we Russians are a peace loving people, I wonder what it would take to garner cooperation from the Austrian in leaving Rumania alone and allowing us to see how the Balkans shake out.<br/><br/>Excellent point, Willow! I of course recognize Russia's interest in Rumania, and there are circumstances in which a Russian fleet in Rumania is quite welcome. I look at the totality of the board, of course, and consider what else is going on. Should Army Warsaw invade Galicia, for example, Russian protestations of mildness are ipso facto invalidated. Conversely, should a strong anti-Turkish opening materialize, Austria might be in a position to lend its support to Russia's efforts to take and hold Rumania. Conversely, given the opacity of early Turkish moves, he will have <i>work harder</i> to signal the same level of partisanship toward Austria and against Russia than Russia does contrariwise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304082/#Comment_304082" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-12T13:27:44+00:00" title="December 12, 2010  1:27PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Willow,<br/><br/>I appreciate the offer, and would be happy to consider you an ally, should you need support "from the other side" in the cases of Germany and Turkey.

But I want to make sure that you're aware of the ramifications of what you've suggested for the immediate future. Note that you're implying that you'll move Nap-Ion in the spring, a move that usually presages either Nap-Tun via an Ionian Sea convoy or a straightforward naval assault on Tunis via Ion-Tun. In either case, the Italian fleet normally has a busy first year. You're suggesting that you'll potentially instead order Ion S Alb-Gre or Ion S Ser-Gre in the fall, which means you forgo your 1901 build in the interest of the longer-term strategic partnership. That's a gutsy move (and actually not bad strategy, Tunis is out of the way and hard to reach, so it's in no danger of going to anyone else), but it can be nerve-wracking for Italy to feel itself underpowered in 1902. If you're willing to do it, though, I am absolutely prepared to play that game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304087/#Comment_304087" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-12T13:46:43+00:00" title="December 12, 2010  1:46PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite><cite>Posted By: Mel White</cite>Some, if not all of the openings Bill mentions are here:<a href="http://www.diplom.org/Online/Openings/" rel="nofollow">Diplomacy Openings Library</a></blockquote>\nOh, dear.

Now, it is of course permissible to take into account a player's reputation as reliable or tricky or what have you, but decisions about alliance and betrayal should hinge solely upon the in-game motivation of either making it into the draw or winning outright.

Still, I know more about you and your strategic skills than many of the other players, so from that perspective it is logical for me to consider your amity in the game a valuable asset for Italy at this point. No matter: within a few turns of this game, I will know more about all the players than I currently know about you! <br/><br/>Meanwhile, I've looked at the resources you've kindly pointed out to me.

Starting as the do, positioned at each other's throats, this would assit both of them in the early game. However the currently proposed division makes an already vulnerable positioning even more so. The first to stab the other would win. Italy will certainly need to avoid attacking all out, and leaving her home cities vulnerable.<br/>\n<br/>\nTurkey, though likely to loose the Balkans, has the best defensive position of any nation. It would be a long or impossible slog for Austria to take Turkey out of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis means that the main thrust of the Austrian attack, after the easy gains in the Balkans, will be against Russia.  This indicates that Russia and Turkey would do well not to start a war with each other.

I won't be doing much of that at this point simply because the more elaborate sort of things would require some surprise or uncertainty from the victims side. I'll just play one of the conventional openings and see what's what, and once somebody chooses me as their enemy I'll start looking for allies against them. Easy.<br/><br/>Regarding Paul's Italian alliances, it's very well to <i>say</i> that you're going to ally with Daumantas because you like his hair more, but the actual proof'll be in the moves, what one's willing to do for their partner. In the case of Italy, I'd like to recommend the good ol' Greek opening, it's served me well over the years: just put your southern forces into position to claim Greece by convoy in the fall and arrange with both Austria and Turkey to have them support you into the place. It's a small price for them both when it comes to gaining an ally, and those two have much bigger geopolitical issues between themselves than they have with Italy, so they're unlikely to come to a separate agreement amongst themselves. Greece will be an excellent position for Italy for almost any future developments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304102/#Comment_304102" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-12T15:54:21+00:00" title="December 12, 2010  3:54PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Calculus has a good point about the eastern positions, actually. I haven't been thinking about it, but the open negotiation environment should technically mean that the Power relationships shift in the places where a Power's strength or weakness depends on surprise, synergies of alliance or similar inter-Power details. This effect just might be the most dramatic with the traditional weak monarchy, Austria: Austria can actually give and take quite nicely against any single opponent, so most neighbours might be much more loathe to go at it with Austria when there's no option of hiring a secret ally in advance; whoever chooses to attack Austria will have to survive at least the first round of the struggle alone, until the other neighbours realize what's going on and participate in the traditional feeding frenzy. Well-played Austria might give a bloody nose to such attempts!<br/><br/>Turkey's going to be just as ass to attack as it always is, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304104/#Comment_304104" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-12T16:39:32+00:00" title="December 12, 2010  4:39PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, good!

If not, we will have two possibilities: either we make the Trieste trade immediately (which would be a rather trusting move on your behalf, I realize!), in the Fall, or we delay the entire scheme until 1902, when my support in Greece would help you build a stronger position against Turkey or Russia, if either of them prove hostile.<br/><br/>Given such a plan, what opening moves would you recommend for Italy?</blockquote>\nOkay. I'm not going to specify a move set, but trust that you will find it more enjoyable and more instructive to puzzle your way to a workable set of moves. The chapter on Italy in Sharp's book (available on the Diplomacy Archives site) is worth reading in that regard, as are the articles by Birsan, Hucknall, Swinnerton, and Swanson.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304113/#Comment_304113" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-12T18:45:57+00:00" title="December 12, 2010  6:45PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Peter: you'll probably want to start Germany with one of two alternative moves: F Kie-Den is a good move that gives you a lot of influence in the Nordic area (including the opportunity to deny Sweden to Russia), while F Kie-Hol gets your foot into the doorway in the Low Countries that are going to be something of an issue between us western Powers. Regardless of which way Kiel jumps the obvious accompaniment is Ber-Kie and Mun-Ruhr; I never recommend opening hostilities between Russia and Germany during the first year by either moving into the Pru-Sil corridor, as it overextends whichever party decides to try it.<br/><br/>There is also Mun-Bur to consider; the idea with Mun-Ruh is that it gives you either a claim to Holland, or a claim to Belgium if you're already claiming Holland with the fleet in the spring. However, a Kaiser who decides not to contest Belgium (perhaps because of English alliance) might choose to play into Burgundy to give the French leadership a nasty scare. France has a depth of defense that makes an outright conquest very hazardous business, but moving Mun-Bur-Bel through the first year is a great way to force the Frenchman to consider compromises; for instance, if France can be convinced to try to bounce Spa-Mar in the fall, then the Burgundy attack has effectively denied Spain to France for the first year. Very nice, although obviously politically volatile and therefore not to everybody's liking. (The reason for why this move is not as good for claiming Belgium is that France might well play Par-Bur and bounce; of course, bouncing the French might well be better than having a "claim" on Belgium, Burgundy being the volatile position is. An arranged bounce, perhaps?)<br/><br/>The Kiel fleet, on the other hand, is a very interesting issue. I would hazard to recommend Kie-Den as the better move insofar as overall stability etc. goes - so if you're uncertain and don't have a particular long-term plan, go with that. Denying Sweden to Russia is an excellent move if you find in the fall that it'll be advantageous to make the Czar cry; Russia has feet of clay, denying their northern build in 1901 has dramatic effect on Russian diplomacy later - it's not unusual to see Russia outright fail as a Power because of this little bounce and some ill luck in the eastern negotiations. (Not that this is necessarily useful for Germany; I don't recommend bouncing blindly, better to talk it over with the eastern triangle Powers and decide on the basis of relative strength: if Russia has a strong alliance and it seems that he's going to dominate the east, then you should bounce him, and if not, then it's probably better for you to give him a bone up north.)<br/><br/>Note that the British crown concedes and acknowledges German claim to the Dutch Netherlands, so that's not an issue either way; as far as I'm concerned you're free to move up to Denmark with the fleet and take Holland with your armies in the fall, no contest in that as far I'm concerned. Of course you can do Kie-Hol and then follow up with Kie-Den in the fall with the army, so either way you should be looking at a solid two SCs in the first year. It's not a bad idea for Germany to accept these two and not try anything further, but you have the option: you can try claim Belgium as well for a third build.<br/><br/>Germany is the only central Power on the board with a truly powerful starting position, which makes it an interesting and dynamic country to play. You have almost as much initial growth potential as France and even more mid-term opportunity, but you also have the Austrian problem of many neighbours with limited growth opportunities. Choosing solid allies and acting to mutual advantage helps rein in the flank wars that often decimate Germany: ensure that you do not overextend against one opponent without other neighbours either having committed to other wars or them being on your side to begin with.<br/><br/>Regarding British relations, I'm expecting a long and fruitful relationship with our imperial cousins on the continent; the key to a successful relationship is for Germany to limit itself mostly to army builds while keeping out of the North Sea - and by association the Atlantic. There's plenty of room for German expansion on the continent, and the British navy can easily provide the necessary naval support for any combined arms operations that might come up. Assuming a German alliance, the natural English interests lie in the Nordic area - we'll see if the alliance is to be, but if it is, we might see a joint push to the east, or an effort at extinguishing the French, or both. Speculative all at this point, of course - we might consider a western triple alliance as well, that might fare well in the open diplomacy environment; I have difficulty imagining how the east could answer the triple even if they knew that it was coming <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>I'm not favouring Germany in my personal diplomatic relations, incidentally - just felt like writing a short overview of the German opening opportunitites. As I said earlier, my defensible geographic position leaves me the luxury of choosing my allies, so I'll be happy to just wait and see how France and Germany open before making any decisions. For what it's worth I'm a bit more comfortable working with a Germany that opens to Denmark with the fleet just because that shows a willingness to not let Russia overrun the Nordic sphere, but an opening into the Netherlands is no immediate deal-breaker, either, especially if accompanied by a clear strategic mission proposal.<br/><br/>While saying all this, I should probably make a nod at the Czarinna as well: no ill intent here, just trying to make sure that the Kaiser keeps onto the best peace pledge he has for now instead of squandering it. Russia can take Sweden insofar as I'm concerned, it's all to the good if the Swedish ore deposits are used to fuel some smiting of our historical Ottoman rivals down south. Just don't open with Mos-StP and I'll be a happy duckling.<br/><br/>All of the above being said, I think that the western triple is an idea that might be considered further. Anybody up to developing the thought a bit? If we are to plot in public sight, let us at least choose the strategic model that makes counter-plots the most awkward.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304116/#Comment_304116" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-12T19:40:10+00:00" title="December 12, 2010  7:40PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>It's great to read your analysis for the German power. However, something caught my eye:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>for instance, if France can be convinced to try to bounce Spa-Mar in the fall, then the Burgundy attack has effectively denied Spain to France for the first year.</blockquote>\nAre you saying that occupying a country during the Spring, and then moving out in the Fall, doesn't allow you to control both countries? Does this mean that one unit cannot ever capture two SCs in one turn? <br/><br/>This might be an important point, in terms of rules, for me to understand before we begin this! I've been assuming that if, say, France moves Marseilles - Spain - Portugal in the two moves of 1901, that counts as two SCs won... but does it mean that, in this case, only Portugal would be considered a French conquest?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304120/#Comment_304120" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-12T20:51:48+00:00" title="December 12, 2010  8:51PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, good of that to come up - you only take possession of a SC during winter. This is often important for tactical reasons, and it gives rise to some fancy strategic moves as well. A classic is Key Lepanto, in which Italy moves Ven-Tri-Ser in the first year, seemingly attacking Austria but actually travelling through towards Turkey. Another one is the Turko-Russian dream position where they manage to have the Russian Black Sea fleet move through Constantinople to the Mediterranean, thus securing their mutual border nicely and providing the Turk a valuable naval ally.<br/><br/>And yes, this is also important in the west. You can't, for example, move Kie-Hol-Bel in the first year and just sweep those SCs with one unit; the unit only takes possession of its last position at the end of the year. The same goes for France, who will ideally try to take control of the Iberian SCs quickly and with a minimum of unit time spent, all the time eyeing Belgium as well. In practice France will most conventionally dedicate the fleet to taking Portugal and the southern army to taking Spain, although there are variants, and of course France has the leeway for trying all sorts of other moves as well - for instance, it's viable for France to go Mar-Bur, Par-Pic to bounce a potential German assault while also taking a stab at Belgium, with a good fallback position in Mar-Spa if the first move bounces.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calculus" title="Calculus"><img alt="Calculus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calculus">Calculus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304144/#Comment_304144" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-13T05:41:01+00:00" title="December 13, 2010  5:41AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, the proof of intentions and alliances is in the dispositions of troops, not in the friendliness of the words.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Piers" title="Piers"><img alt="Piers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Piers">Piers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304146/#Comment_304146" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-13T06:03:04+00:00" title="December 13, 2010  6:03AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            About Italian openings:<br/><br/>Although there are a lot of possible combinations, the mix of forces and terrain brings the number of  conventional openings down very rapidly.<br/><br/>Fleet Naples almost always moves to the Ionian: neither coast move is as good as a move to sea. Tyrrhenian sea allows access to Tunis and threatens France. Ionian is more neutral, gives leverage over Greece, and blocks the middle Med.<br/><br/>Army Venice is the only unit in the game that regularly holds on it's first turn, which should give you an idea of how delicate the situation with Austria. Almost every other forward move threatens someone: Piedmont annoys but cannot really harm the French; Tyrol menaces Germany and Austria; Trieste is an out and out attack.<br/><br/>Finally, Army Rome usually links up with one or both of the other forces, moving to defend Venice of it is vacated, or heading south to Apulia ready for a convoy. (Apulia allows you to defend Venice if you need to.)<br/><br/>Most Italian openings are amcombination of these moves, and unless you have a very specific plan the arguments behind them generally hold water. The real question you should be asking yourself is where does supply center five come from. The worry with Italy is that you will get stuck after taking Tunis and then killed at your neighbors' leisure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304191/#Comment_304191" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-13T10:43:53+00:00" title="December 13, 2010 10:43AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Eero">@Eero</a>: Thank you for your sage advice!

Not that I have any particular plans in this regard yet, so I'll be fine with doing as the empress desires.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304331/#Comment_304331" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-14T07:16:45+00:00" title="December 14, 2010  7:16AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 14, 2010 7:17AM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-23527-1-O.png" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-23527-1-O.png"/></a>Hah, that was interesting. Turkey made a very good call regarding Russia, which made a risky play in not bouncing in the Black Sea. The Italian and Austrian moves are also in great tension, making the east a veritable powder-keg. Austria could push east rather effectively if not for Italy, while Turkey has a definite upper hand tactically, but of course will be in trouble if Austria and Russia play together consistently (and Italy doesn't cripple Austria). There's even room for the old Tyr-Mun surprise twist supported by Burgundy, always good for a laugh - and of course hilarious to set up without private negotiations.<br/><br/>Meanwhile we have a relatively calm time here in the west, as is usually the case - the Calhamer map encourages conflict in the east and creeping developments in the west. Seems like we'll have to talk about Belgium, but aside from that the situation's relatively clear-cut: France takes her usual spoils in Iberia, Germany gets Denmark (or Sweden) and Holland, we of the British Empire will traipse into either Belgium or Norway - or if the negotiations go well, even both, although I sorely doubt that this'll be feasible without the blessings of both of my western neighbours.<br/><br/>I like the Italian opening with those two armies up north rather a lot; I think that an Italy with two armies up there is signaling confidence. Lots of options and probably the most influence on the overall board dynamics any single player can have, what with the potential to interfere with France, Germany, Austria and Turkey available all at once. This is the strength of Italy, the ability to balance the other Powers in a way that foils everybody. Of course the open diplomacy environment will make elaborate ploys rather challenging.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304349/#Comment_304349" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-14T08:29:24+00:00" title="December 14, 2010  8:29AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 14, 2010 8:34AM by Paul_T.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, I am glad you like the Italian opening: I chose it simply because it's listed as the most popular in the "Openings" library!

Certainly shook things up a bit! Can't say I'm rooting for you, though. I know where you'd be going next! Still, talk to you if your gains are not as splendid as they seem to promise to be, alright?<br/><br/>I myself am doing a happy little dance of having taken control of the BLA, as is quite understandable! However, I would like to make it clear that I am not at all interested in escalating hostilities with Russia - not out of the goodness of my heart, of course, but out of sheer self-preservation... No way am I going to make any gains against Russia anytime soon. No way is Russia going to make gains against me anytime soon (until the situation with Italy and Austria is resolved, one way or another, or until she decides to commit another fleet to the south), either. Willows - getting in a war now means I can't nibble bits off the Balkans and you have to trust Eero not to walk over from Norway to StP with a single army.<br/><br/>Willows, tell me, how much do you want Rumania? As it is, you are not that likely to get it right now, are you? The situation is threatening to me and I will act defensive. However, I recognise Russia's claim to it, and would be willing to surrender it to you provided that you show willingness to, well, move your troops some other direction than Turkey-wards (A Ukr-Gal, for example). In the meantime, would you perhaps consider allowing a Turkish claim to Rumania? Would help me build a fleet that I could commit to Mediterranean action, which would help me hinder the italian's good fortunes which now seem to be forthcoming... Would also allow a little turkish headstart - long-term turkish-russian cooperation tends to favor Russia, as I hear, so a little nod to offset that predicament would certainly be appreciated.<br/><br/>Bill... Blood's in the water, my friend! I hope you survive, but judging from an extremelly similar situation I experienced as Austria in my very first game... Well, good luck to you! I'd offer you some help in one manner or another - certainly don't want you out of the game this soon! However, at this stage, and without the possibility of making agreements in secret, I can't really do much of anything without compromising my own strategic options. Hope you manage to come out on top here!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304361/#Comment_304361" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-14T09:27:25+00:00" title="December 14, 2010  9:27AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>By the way: does the PlayDiplomacy site have any kind of tutorial or explanation of their play interface?

Austria can defend against Italy's attack, but gives up a chance at Greece to do so.  <br/>If Turkey and Russia cannot reach an accord, Russia could end 1901 with no builds, depending on relations with Germany.

Turkey made a very good call regarding Russia, which made a risky play in not bouncing in the Black Sea. The Italian and Austrian moves are also in great tension, making the east a veritable powder-keg. Austria could push east rather effectively if not for Italy, while Turkey has a definite upper hand tactically, but of course will be in trouble if Austria and Russia play together consistently (and Italy doesn't cripple Austria). There's even room for the old Tyr-Mun surprise twist supported by Burgundy, always good for a laugh - and of course hilarious to set up without private negotiations.<br/><br/>Meanwhile we have a relatively calm time here in the west, as is usually the case - the Calhamer map encourages conflict in the east and creeping developments in the west. Seems like we'll have to talk about Belgium, but aside from that the situation's relatively clear-cut: France takes her usual spoils in Iberia, Germany gets Denmark (or Sweden) and Holland, we of the British Empire will traipse into either Belgium or Norway - or if the negotiations go well, even both, although I sorely doubt that this'll be feasible without the blessings of both of my western neighbours.<br/><br/>I like the Italian opening with those two armies up north rather a lot; I think that an Italy with two armies up there is signaling confidence. Lots of options and probably the most influence on the overall board dynamics any single player can have, what with the potential to interfere with France, Germany, Austria and Turkey available all at once. This is the strength of Italy, the ability to balance the other Powers in a way that foils everybody. Of course the open diplomacy environment will make elaborate ploys rather challenging.</blockquote>\nLook at Eero's glibness- he's using his famed powers of suggestion here to attempt to 1) pit Italy and Austria against each other 2) encourage Italy to entangle Germany, or cause Germany to overreact, strengthening his own position, and  3) encouraging Germany to bounce me out of Sweden (seriously Eero, if I can't have it, no one will).  I know what you're doing Eero!<br/><br/>I'll make it clear right now, Eero: no armies in Norway.

Still, talk to you if your gains are not as splendid as they seem to promise to be, alright?<br/><br/>I myself am doing a happy little dance of having taken control of the BLA, as is quite understandable! However, I would like to make it clear that I am not at all interested in escalating hostilities with Russia - not out of the goodness of my heart, of course, but out of sheer self-preservation... No way am I going to make any gains against Russia anytime soon. No way is Russia going to make gains against me anytime soon (until the situation with Italy and Austria is resolved, one way or another, or until she decides to commit another fleet to the south), either. Willows - getting in a war now means I can't nibble bits off the Balkans and you have to trust Eero not to walk over from Norway to StP with a single army.<br/><br/>Willows, tell me, how much do you want Rumania? As it is, you are not that likely to get it right now, are you? The situation is threatening to me and I will act defensive. However, I recognise Russia's claim to it, and would be willing to surrender it to you provided that you show willingness to, well, move your troops some other direction than Turkey-wards (A Ukr-Gal, for example). In the meantime, would you perhaps consider allowing a Turkish claim to Rumania? Would help me build a fleet that I could commit to Mediterranean action, which would help me hinder the italian's good fortunes which now seem to be forthcoming... Would also allow a little turkish headstart - long-term turkish-russian cooperation tends to favor Russia, as I hear, so a little nod to offset that predicament would certainly be appreciated.<br/><br/>Bill... Blood's in the water, my friend! I hope you survive, but judging from an extremelly similar situation I experienced as Austria in my very first game... Well, good luck to you! I'd offer you some help in one manner or another - certainly don't want you out of the game this soon! However, at this stage, and without the possibility of making agreements in secret, I can't really do much of anything without compromising my own strategic options. Hope you manage to come out on top here!</blockquote>\nDaumantas-<br/><br/>It's just "Willow."  There's only one of me.  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>It would be very foolish of me to allow you a "headstart," especially after you tried to sneak into Armenia (never mind that I did the same thing, let's let bygones be bygones.)  I won't be supporting any plan that gets you two builds in the south and me none.  In fact, you already stand a very good chance of getting two builds by moving BLA-Bul (ec) and Bul to either Greece or Serbia.<br/><br/>A Russian-Turkish alliance is still salvageable, in fact I think it may be stronger due to the positioning of Italy and Austria:  if they are at war, they'll be at each other's throats, leading to a natural triple alliance with Italy.  (Hi Italy!)  If they aren't, we'll, they're going to be coming at you and you'll need a friend to fend them off.<br/><br/>So with that in mind, I suggest at the very least you do allow me to keep Rumania, and I'm willing to accede to your judgement whether you'd rather see me take it with a fleet or an army.

It seems that the Kaiser is cool with my rolling into Belgium as well, so that seems settled until further notice. If Burgundy has nothing better to do, you could even support me for the sake of the gesture...<br/><br/>I think that Russia and Turkey should technically be able to salvage a quite nice alliance out of their bounce - it was Russian aggression, but you want a hungry ally anyway, and there's no lasting harm. For example, Russia could simply move Sev-Rum with Ukr in support and end up in a completely normal Juggernaut positioning for the fall, just like the spring moves had never happened. Right now it seems that Austria is slowing down but not out (for what it's worth, I believe that Italy's not going to betray Austria - too dangerous geopolitically), which means that the Juggernaut has plenty of time to set up their play, really, but they should get to it and not let Austria and Italy work out their differences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304486/#Comment_304486" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-15T00:15:51+00:00" title="December 15, 2010 12:15AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apologies!<br/><br/>Willow - I would actually be fine with you taking Rumania, but only if our good German friend was not allowing you into Sweden.

In the mean time, if you build fleets, take hold of Belgium, and make good with France, you might find the two of you in a good position to place units on the British mainland- only with you providing the fleets and France the armies, the opposite of what usually occurs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calculus" title="Calculus"><img alt="Calculus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calculus">Calculus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304521/#Comment_304521" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-15T07:16:12+00:00" title="December 15, 2010  7:16AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 15, 2010 7:17AM by Calculus.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Willow">@Willow</a> - Yes, I figured it was very likely that England would stab me this turn.

An army in Norway is completely conventional and just as much or little a threat to Russia as anything else I might put in there. With your difficult southern position it seems to me that if anything you should be working together with me now - it's no secret that I do not, generally speaking, hit a Power when they're down, so Russia is in no way a target for me at the moment when I can use that army better as a mobile reserve, to be convoyed freely to trouble-spots along the Atlantic coasts. So chill out, build an army and take back Rumania, eh?<br><br>I should discuss the situation with my more immediate neighbours as well: it seems likely that my visit in Brest cast a shadow on a Mediterranean strategy on the part of the French, a course of events that doesn't seem that awful to me now - Italy played a honorable game and got bitten for it, it seems, so it's fortunate that the French offensive shaping up down in Spain is likely to be cancelled now.<br/><br/>Peter: If you're interested, I would be willing to work out a long-term alliance with Germany at this point, as it seems that we have mutual concerns on the board here. Specifically, I'd be happy to ensure that you gain and hold the Low Countries with your army strength in exchange for pacification of the French aggression that is likely to occur soon. We might discuss the ultimate fate of the French Republic, of course, but for now it'd be enough for me if you occupy Belgium and perhaps Burgundy; I'm all for it if you choose to put pressure on Paris as well, of course, but perhaps we should listen to what Calculus has to say as well. The important part is that your strength combined with mine would keep the current situation from getting worse, ensuring the security of both our empires quite handsomely.<br/><br/>We also have joint interests up in the Nordic area, which is another reason for cooperation: if Willow feels strongly enough about me to call for allies against my entirely legitimate interests in Norway, then it might not be a bad idea to note that insofar as I'm concerned, Sweden could as well belong to Germany instead of the Czar - your fleet is in a fine position for it, so if Willow does build against us in StP, I'll be quite ready to support you into Sweden in the interests of balance in the local theater. (In no case am I interested in Sweden myself, it's clearly a matter between Russia and Germany insofar as spheres of interest and national security go; the Baltic Sea is a German sea, as we say here, just like the North Sea is a British one.)<br/><br/>I know that this suggestion'll be considered pure propaganda by certain Powers, but I'll say it anyway: building two armies is probably the most dynamic choice for Germany at the moment, as it allows you to put in an effective thrust at the traditionally problematic French heartlands <i>while</i> also securing Munich against a trivial Italian visit and other such random eastern occurrences. Both your offensive and defensive needs require a large continental presence. I'm mostly saying this because certain Powers will have a vested interest in a large German fleet build-up that will have no other purpose aside from attacking the British Isles; a fine course of action, of course, but one that is not compatible with my cooperation and one that might in the worst case prove dangerous for your homeland security.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304557/#Comment_304557" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-15T09:34:24+00:00" title="December 15, 2010  9:34AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Willow, what about the, uh, "move someplace other than Turkey-wards" part of our possible agreement?<br/><br/>And, as far as I know, it isn't exactly customary for Russia to demand the scuttling of a turkish fleet - rather the reverse.

It also isn't exactly customary for Turkey's fleet to head so far north. But let's look at these issues separately- you know that I'm going to need to take Rumania, and frankly, I don't expect you to have too many places to retreat to. Once it's destroyed, you'd be able to rebuild in Smyrna, getting your fleets closer to where they need to be. Afterwards, I'd be happy to make landfall someplace convenient to disbandment of my fleet- mutual fleet disarmament would be something very useful for both of it.<br/><br/>I'm going to have to insist on a DMZ in Armenia as a term of any future cooperation- without it, any deals between us are simply a non-starter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304573/#Comment_304573" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-15T10:21:42+00:00" title="December 15, 2010 10:21AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought long and hard about the move set I submitted, but one thing was clear: I:Ven-Tyr, I:Rom-Ven was just <i>too damn aggressive</i> for Austria to be sanguine about Italy's benign intentions. It would have been foolish of me to have done anything other than I did. Now, I want it to be clear that in the absence of Ven-Tyr, sacrificing Trieste would have been within the realm of possibility; in fact, in my opening post, I discreetly signaled to Paul that I was willing to play the Key Lepanto, but apparently he didn't pick up on that hidden message.<br/><br/>And I'm still willing to give up Trieste, but not when there's another Italian army sitting in Tyrolia like a knife in my back. You point your armies at your enemies, not your friends. What I'd like to see is Army Tyr back up to Venice or Piedmont, with Army Venice either moving to Apulia or standing fast (signaling westerly or easterly intentions on Italy's part). Alternately, Italy could just sit tight and try to take Trieste by storm, but my intention is to defend it in the spring, and Italy won't be able to take it without forgoing the Tunis build, unless I'm much mistaken.<br/><br/>Peter, your mediation here would be much appreciated: don't you approve of leaving Tyrolia vacant?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

convinced that the Ottomans are striving towards a Turkish Black Sea. This is interesting, let's take a closer look at the decision matrix:<br/><br/>Turkey can build two, which means that there is no problem whatsoever with putting a second fleet into the Black Sea area while simultaneously driving the conventional Mediterranean strategy. ("Two fleets" is what my chief of staff predicts as the Turkish build.) This is great news for Turkey, as Russia can't counter in Sevastopol, meaning that Turkey will have fleet supremacy in the area in the immediate future. Turkish Black Sea (TBS) follows naturally as Turkey takes control of the complete environs of the sea from a weakening Russia.<br/><br/>TBS is in my own Diplomacy mid-game playbook a very central idea, practically the best alternative for the over-used Juggernaut play: Turkey does not need to ovextend itself into conquering Russia entire, as the geography of the area allows her to simply fortify Sevastopol, which is in excellent position to support Rumania even as the place acts as a natural bulwark against the Trump Russia that's left after seizing Sevastopol. A weakened Russia should be grateful for a peace arrangement with fine securities, as Turkey that conquers Sevastopol with a fleet is in no immediate position to threaten Russia further. All this means that the TBS solution allows Turkey a very low-maintenance northern border with natural defensive qualities; being in sole control of the Black Sea gives Turkey tactical "stickiness" that allows her to control a rather high number of neighboring territories with a low number of units - it is in fact impossible for external forces to dislodge the Turk from the Sev-Rum-Bul area once Turkey is in naval control, at least not without clear supremacy in numbers.<br/><br/>Russia has relatively few options regarding the threat of TBS except diplomatical mitigation, as some northern pressure is evident and Willow's probably not going to believe me when I say that I'm not interested in traipsing into a defenseless StP; thus Russia does not have offensive momentum against Turkey, while the Turk can easily put a new unit or even two into the fray to ensure the destruction of the Russian fleet and the conquest of Sevastopol. In fact, Russia might even encourage an ambitious Turkish march to Moscow if she does not yield quickly and gracefully in the matter of Sevastopol. Quite a situation in that regard.<br/><br/>The only question for the future of TBS is Austria, who is playing a quite strong game as well. Italy will probably want to interfere with the Austrian domain as best as she can now that cooperation proved impossible for the two, but in the main part it seems obvious that Austria will have an interest in the Rum-Bul area, seeing as how it neighbours into Austrian eminent domain and Austrian troops are already in position around there. Russia might act quickly to gain an Austrian ally, and Turkey might be convinced to leave Sevastopol in peace if the Austrian threat looms large enough. Of course this has its own problems for Austria and Russia; a war with Turkey is a no-profit war - a crusade if you will - as any gains will have to be made slowly, riskily and likely non-permanently from an opponent who has both excellent defensive geography and a depth of defense now that Turkey is in clear control of the Black Sea environs and Italy has not accomplished significant enroachment into the eastern Mediterranean areas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304639/#Comment_304639" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-15T13:57:01+00:00" title="December 15, 2010  1:57PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Italy played a honorable game and got bitten for it, it seems</blockquote>\nOuch.

If that is indeed his plan, will you consider supporting Italy by forming a coordinated front against Austria? <br/><br/>If Austria's intent is a quick demolition of Italy, probably the most I can do is throw my fleet into support of your attacks on the Balkans.<br/><br/>Bill, I would much prefer the original plan you had agreed to, however... I will not go into war against Austria unless you push me into it. <br/><br/>Eero, I can only plead that you do what you can to keep France from taking advantage of Italy's state!

Italy-Turkey against Austria-Russia is not an awful match-up at the moment, weak as Italy is. Ideally Turkey would help you get into Greece in the near future, for example, and your northern forces would tie down the Austrian; not enough to advance you, perhaps, but enough to prevent Austria from attacking the Turkish Black Sea properties seriously. After you got into Greece you could establish yourself on the Adrian Sea and start working yourself into Trieste, perhaps followed by a peace once you'd established yourself comfortably on the local Mediterranean coasts. Italy is a naval Power by nature, after all, and Trieste is a historical Venetian town.<br/><br/>I mean to say, Austria is not your only choice of ally if Austria is not willing. Especially if France doesn't come down to Italy; as the situation stands, France would have a very sweet, soft flank to bite into if he had the resources to build a second fleet and send the two of them eastwards into the Mediterranean, but the diplomatical situation up here in the north seems to indicate that that's not going to happen. A secure western flank is a precious thing for Italy, as it makes a bit longer and slower war possible, even against Austria.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304652/#Comment_304652" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-15T14:39:40+00:00" title="December 15, 2010  2:39PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul">@Paul</a>: I've been assuming you were acting in good faith, and thank you for the bounce.

The following is 85% objective, I'll try to leave the counter-arguments to the esteemed opposition <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>The thing about attacking England is that it's a slow and up-hill struggle, England being the most defensive Power in the game alongside Turkey. As I'm not exactly going to make it easy, it's pretty much a given that attacking the island is not a good idea unless you can commit a significant fleet, long-term, while there is no danger of other Powers taking advantage of the slow struggle to stab you in the back. I wouldn't claim that these conditions do not occur ever, but it's something to think about - England is by default a worse target, so you should have a good reason to go for it when you do. Besides, regarding timing, I'd say that the best time to put one over England or Turkey probably isn't right at the start of the game due to that defensive edge; you'll want to wait until everybody's clearly committed somewhere and you <i>know</i> that your other neighbours won't make use of your effective weakness when you attack England. End-game is of course a pretty difficult time as well, but not as difficult as right at the start; if I had to choose an abstract moment to "attack England", I'd probably plan for 1904-05 or so, when my own position had been secured enough to allow me to commit the considerable resources required.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, attacking France early is a <i>good</i> idea in many ways, the main of which is that France is the strongest Power on the board by default, and therefore needs to be cut down early and often to prevent a simple victory by default as everybody else struggles to keep up. (France wins the most boards in Calhamer Diplomacy statistically; known fact, that.) It's a happy co-incidence that Germany is in excellent position to benefit in this sort of thing, as the continental position matches well. The Low Countries are easy to take and hold, and the same armies built to crunch France in Paris can travel quickly enough eastwards after the situation in the west calms down. Armies also make an excellent defensive unit for the western continental SC cluster ranging from Paris to Berlin, which means that building them is a superiorly flexible choice for the Kaiser, who needs to consider the dangers and opportunities of the east as well as the west, and be able to shift focus between the two quickly and flexibly.<br/><br/>Long-term England has much to offer as an ally, as Germany and England have several feasible and beneficent SC splits between them: for example, we can arrange our mutual balance in the Nordic and western areas as needed, so that if one advances quickly in the other arena, the other can be helped to equal benefit in the other; I could take Sweden or you could take Sweden, for example, all according to who needs a build and who doesn't. England has a natural interest in Iberia and the Mediterranean area, while Germany has unlimited potential for growth in the east. England naturally builds mostly fleets, while Germany doesn't really need any for anything (except attacking England, of course).<br/><br/>I don't particularly want to argue here that we need some permanent and in-depth alliance, although there is plenty of potential for long-term development as well. Mostly I'd like it if Germany took the opportunity here in the west for the most obvious gains available: building an army in Munich should allow the Kaiser to easily take Belgium and Burgundy, two positions that secure a western line for Germany even if there is no intent to progress any further. Such pressure doesn't cost you much, but it'll gain you a natural SC gain and a very defensible border - peace for our time with France, essentially, whether you'd choose to advance any further or not. This is very attractive for a central Power that always has to worry about flank attacks whenever anything is tried; two armies in the Bel-Bur corridor will ensure that you'll have security in the west even if you decide to march on Warsaw or down south with the rest of your forces.<br/><br/>Either way, I don't particularly need promises from you at this point; it's probably more effective if Germany plays this situation with hidden cards. Just consider the facts, get that army into Munich (a no-brainer anyway, what with Italy up your nose), perhaps another into Kiel and see for yourself. I'll be happy to offer specific tactical advice, of course, if that seems interesting.

Bill, are you really sure you want to make an enemy of Italy?</blockquote>\nPaul, I know exactly what you're going through right now. You feel betrayed and ill-used--every hand is raised against you, nor is any man or woman your friend. I spent half a game feeling like that, as Eero and Daumantas ping-ponged me in the corner as Turkey until I wept bitter tears. "He's going to crack soon," Eero told Daumantas at one point. However, such a mind state is dangerous; it clouds your judgment and leads to self-destructive behavior. There's a book by a sociologist named Thomas Scheff called <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bloody-Revenge-Emotions-Nationalism-War/dp/0595131107" rel="nofollow">Bloody Revenge</a></i> in which he argues that the origins of World War I can be traced to European decision-makers' emotional cycles of shame and rage feeding into each other and escalating so that an initially manageable crisis spun out of control--with the family connections linking the royal heads of state of the various Great Powers contributing to the emotional impact of diplomatic slights and political stratagems. The parallels to a <i>Diplomacy</i> game are uncanny, and it's for that reason that I believe that, fundamentally, <i>Diplomacy</i> is a psychological game.<br/><br/>So what I'd like to do at this point is de-escalate the conflict. From my perspective, you came in charging hard with an aggressive anti-Austrian opening, and I took steps to blunt that. I was convinced that you were going to bounce me in Greece and either support yourself into Trieste or try for Vienna, too, so I maneuvered to keep you out of Greece and potentially keep my loss to a single SC so that I'd be no worse off than 3 to your 4. Of course, in that case I'd probably have been forced into a Janissary strategy, working aggressively on Turkey's behalf and begging for crumbs off the table, but at least I wouldn't have been down to 2 centers with Italians <i>everywhere</i>. I want you to realize that the stakes were high for me: literally existential. You saw Daumantas's message to me: "Blood is in the water, old chum. Good luck; you're going to need it."<br/><br/>In your current predicament, however, the danger is <i>not</i> existential. Tunis isn't going anywhere; you can pick it up at leisure. The only unit within striking distance is the French fleet sunning itself along the Spanish Riviera, and you can get there before he does--and he may have pressing business elsewhere, as Eero points out. And you are going to want that fleet build, since if Eero is correct, we are about to see a Turkish naval build-up that, although initially directed at Russia, will soon be looking for trouble in the Med. The situation along the Austro-Italian border is essentially a stalemate. Given that, we should do as good Go players do, and turn our attention elsewhere. For my part, I'd like to worry about events in the East. You might think about putting a little pressure on France, especially since if Germany and England are double-teaming him, you will be the only one in a position to keep Eero out of the Med--and anyone who knows Eero knows that he views crossing the stalemate line (in this case, from MAO to Wes) as a critical threshold on the way to victory. More importantly, your fifth build could be Marseilles.<br/><br/>Bottom line: We're still in the center, and the sharks are all around.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304734/#Comment_304734" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-15T21:19:51+00:00" title="December 15, 2010  9:19PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill, <br/><br/>Your description of my feelings about the game at this point is apt (even more so when I tell you about my other game, which I will be posting in the other thread tomorrow--I will *really* need your help there, although I suspect my case there might be lost altogether, Turkey done for forever). <br/><br/>However, in your analysis you are omitting an important detail: I am not in an existential situation... only so long as <i>you</i> do not attack me.

If nothing else, fighting well garners respect from the other players, and is a reward in itself afterwards.<br/><br/>My own play in the fall as Italy would have been to take Tunisia and Trieste by force, no doubt about that; the tempo advantage you gain by getting your SCs quickly is too important at the beginning to waste unit moves on secondary concerns such as your purely diplomatic bounce with Germany. The choice of keeping an important home SC was too easy for Austria, especially when you remember that this whole "Italy takes Trieste as a surety of peace" thing is an exceptional diplomatical plot. (Not that exceptional can't work, but it needs to be clearly superior to the alternatives.) Besides, two SCs is already in the golden territory for Italy, who almost always has to settle for only one.<br/><br/>Looking forward, though, I agree with Bill in that you're not nearly out of the game yet. Italy is by nature a defensive Power and slow to grow, so a stalled first year is not nearly fatal the way it would be for, say, Russia. Every single one of your potential foemen has other, more aggressive neighbours to worry about, so you're likely to not be even challenged through 1902; use the time to maneuver and lull your target(s), and then strike in the fall to make gains for yourself. Meanwhile be sure to use diplomatic means to ensure that everybody else continues fighting everybody else; you do not have much to offer to others in terms of military strength, so instead offer them viewpoints and ensure that no jingoist argument is left unsaid when it comes to the international conflicts that benefit your own goals. Let others fight for you and use your strength where it suffices as a tipping point, in the places where others cannot spare sufficient forces against you.<br/><br/>As an illustrative example of this sort of thinking, consider France with the playful assumption that England and/or Germany are going to put the place to the torch. Which forces are in position to mobilize against  the northern neighbours? Which will be around if you choose to join in the fray? Which SCs are such that you'll find them easy to hold and keep? How can you mobilize, and when will France realize your intent? When can your first strike happen? These sorts of thoughts will help you craft a plan, perhaps something in the best traditions of the Italian Cha-Cha, with seemingly anti-Austrian forces pivoting on a penny and marching into Piedmont instead.<br/><br/>Consider Turkey, Austria and France all in terms of their pre-existing commitments on other fronts, and find the place where you can strike fruitfully with a limited operational force for limited gain, preferably in a place that is easy to hold and offers tactical synergies for further developments later. Consider places like Greece or Marseilles or Trieste in terms of foreign colonies you hold at your pleasure, not as integral parts of an expanding empire as the more robust Powers do; relinquish untenable positions to strike at new gains, and be completely opportunistic about it. Italy is just about the worst Power to play for any sort of paladin-like attitudes such as honor and long-term commitment to anything except your own consistently rising SC count.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calculus" title="Calculus"><img alt="Calculus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calculus">Calculus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304761/#Comment_304761" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-16T02:49:06+00:00" title="December 16, 2010  2:49AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 16, 2010 3:13AM by Calculus.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Peter">@Peter</a> I think the biggest difference is what the map will look like four years from now.

If the existence of England as a Power is a guaranteed problem for Germany and it's just a matter of fighting England now or later, say, then it's probably best to attack the place right away even if it is a bit of a risk in other ways - after all, if England is a priori a problem, then nothing else you do on the board matters as much as killing England before it's too late. I haven't seen many Diplomacy strategists take this sort of a hardcore stance on any single Power, though, as most seem to think that any two Powers can cooperate long-term with proper diplomacy.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calculus" title="Calculus"><img alt="Calculus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calculus">Calculus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304765/#Comment_304765" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-16T03:54:54+00:00" title="December 16, 2010  3:54AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "I'm with Calculus on the basic issue, though" - Lol, sounds like Mark Anthony's, "I've come to bury Caesar, not to praise him."

When I last played Germany myself (last year in a face-to-face game, I seem to remember) I had trouble with my erstwhile English ally, trouble of exactly this sort - England has this amazing defensive position that easily ends up with a one-sided threat where Germany has to invest quite a lot in defending himself from his ally, whether there be any plots afoot or not. I ended up giving him Denmark as tribute just so I wouldn't have to be constantly worrying about him taking it by force, as there was no technical reason for why he couldn't just walze in there whenever he wanted. (I'm a firm believer in alliance justified by momentary positioning, not as an abstract commitment of honor - and I'd taught the player in question to play myself, so he didn't hesitate in pressuring me to give everything I could just because he had the superior position...)<br><br>Anyway, I think I've got some understanding of how to make the Anglo-German alliance more balanced nowadays. For one, it would be ideal for Germany to take Sweden and StP and perhaps trade something to England for Norway as well, so as to make England a strictly western and southern Power, with Germany in full control of the Nordic area. Even if not this extreme (leaves England a minority partner in terms of SCs if Germany is conquering France at the same time as well), merely agreeing to keep English fleets strictly to the west of the Danish straits (including Sweden) is an absolute necessity so as to prevent England from doing a quick mobilization in the Baltic Sea. A North Sea demilitarization is also definitely a reasonable plan when Germany moves the Denmark fleet deeper into the Baltic - Germany can get a lot out of that fleet as a convoy from Kiel to deep east, and demilitarizing the central English route to a German attack pacifies things quite a bit. Meanwhile there's no reason why England can't emphasize a southern strategy, pushing through to the Mediterranean area.<br><br>The point is, I'm definitely aware of the hurdles England and Germany have in their relationship, and I'm interested in working them out. Of course I'm equally interested in working out my differences with France, now that we're talking, Calculus - how about we agree on English control of the Mid-Atlantic and a moratorium on French fleet builds in exchange for you getting Brest back and peace between our great Powers? Seems like a good alternative in case the Kaiser doesn't want to work with us, don't you think? I could go walze in the Baltic areas while you build up an army force and do what comes naturally to continental Powers.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304770/#Comment_304770" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-16T04:48:29+00:00" title="December 16, 2010  4:48AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul --<br><br>I've already told you what I'm going to do.

Just let me know how you want to proceed in that theater, and I'm your man.<br><br>The tactical reality of an attack on England at the moment is really grim due to how France is all but incapable of putting out a significant fleet in the near future, while any German fleet will have to fight its way out of the Baltic region against an England that doesn't really have anything else to do aside from making it difficult. You could do it, I hazard, but it'd take years, and experience dictates that things tend to change in those timeframes: allies decide to find quicker routes to power, other wars elsewhere end and Powers start seeking new targets, that sort of thing.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calculus" title="Calculus"><img alt="Calculus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calculus">Calculus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304781/#Comment_304781" name="Item_118" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-16T06:24:28+00:00" title="December 16, 2010  6:24AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Eero">@Eero</a> Handing over MOA is handing over France.

Thus, to clarify: my offering to withdraw my claims in the Nordic area is a seriously considered proposition, and a weighty, game-changing move if we manage to work together thanks to that. I'm specifically not promising unrealistic moves like relinquishing Norway without making a gain in another place in the same year or other sacrificial moves like that - it's just a long-term agreement on a direction, not a fantasy spiel that I'm offering. Thinking on it realistically, if Germany puts 1-2 armies and that fleet to work in the Nordic area, we might achieve total separation of interests in 2-3 years; not instant, but then real tactics rarely are. The basic idea is solid, however: I won't initiate new projects in the Nordic theater myself, and will support German interests in the area, and will trade in Norway at an opportune moment for something else down south. Tactical details will have to wait contingent on the builds, especially considering the open diplomacy environment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304784/#Comment_304784" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-16T06:35:47+00:00" title="December 16, 2010  6:35AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One army and one fleet is border-line for England, but we can live with it, especially if we agree that neither fleet leaves comes west of Den-Swe. So that'd be option b) for us. The biggest issue is that while the second fleet will be useful against Russia for a limited time, and it'll increase German security against England somewhat (mostly as something to scare England with; armies defend as well), in the mid-term and long-term the second fleet will be somewhat under-used. Of course there are ways to get rid of units later, but they're awkward.<br><br>But yeah, I won't consider it an end of negotiations if you build one of both. Probably not a bad choice tactically, as it retains some flexibility, although I'd be worried about your ability to wage a massive land-war; continental warcraft tends to rely on massive army lines, it's always nice to have one more army in those.

Just so you know that I'm still in the game even if I'm not spreading out my thoughts all over the place here.<br><br/>In the interests of tactical security I'll communicate just the spare essentials in the following - everybody can assume that I'll be inputting moves to accord with my suggestions. No need for anybody to confirm or deny this stuff, it's all just extra information for the enemy. Simply do it if it seems like a reasonable idea. And don't worry if I'm telling somebody else stuff that contradicts something I told you, it's all just lies to lull our mutual enemies into a daze; I wouldn't like to you, would I?<br/><br/>Peter - by all means attack Sweden if you would; that's a good chance of a build for you, and it'll help us rein in Willow, who seems to have decided to make a fight of it in the Nordic area. You'll note that she can't both retain Sweden and take Norway with the same moves. I also recommend moving to Belgium and supporting yourself into Burgundy, or perhaps vice versa - no big deal if there are bounces, as you'll have another chance to occupy Belgium in the fall. You have enough forces to keep Munich covered all the while as well, so it's all looking good for you.<br/><br/>Calculus - how about if I keep Brest, then, as a surety, but desist from advancing to MAO? We could demilitarize MAO quite easily, and that's a reasonable secure border for the both of us, especially if you desist from building fleets down south.<br/><br/>Willow - that northern fleet is a problem, no two ways about it. As it happens I sold Norway (and St. Petersburg, begging your pardon) to the Kaiser just now, so in principle it's his problem, but I'd rather not get haunted out of Norway with my tail between my legs. You're a cunning operator and aggressive - reminds me of myself - but perhaps you'd like to negotiate for peace? I'm still not eager to fight Russia, as you have your hands full with the southern situation already; you should be a major player in the eastern triangle, but as things stand you're very fortunate if the strong Austrian and Turkish empires decide to fight each other instead of attacking you. I'd rather see more balance down south, and Russia getting stripped of its northern depth doesn't feel right just yet. I'm open to ideas, although that fleet is ass, much worse than an army would have been. Sort of forces me to bring another unit to the environs just to defend my legitimate interests.<br/><br/>Everybody else - fight that good fight! I'll be back tomorrow to see what's what, and I expect to see blood and betrayals and spite. Italy should probably forget about any French dreams, and that new Austrian fleet is a curve-ball for the eastern Mediterranean naval balance, no two ways about it. The two Turkish fleets, those speak to me of aggressive Black Sea operations; no need for that Constantinople fleet to go south <i>right</i> away when it can first throw in a support and block the retreat route of F Bla. But afterwards that fleet is coming down to the Aegean Sea, and just in time, too, considering the obvious Austrian move.

Eventually you and he are going to come to blows in the Med, and when that happens, I want to be in a position to make sure that your progress is slow at best. In the meantime, it is not unreasonable for you and I to reach some sort of understanding where we neutralize Russia as a threat and then each try to convince Italy to partner up against the other.

When you started asking about openings, Paul, I wondered if you had twigged to it, but your opening moves showed me that you hadn't, because if you had you'd have known that Trieste was going to be open. I even sent you to Sharp's book, where he talks about the Key Lepanto in shuddering tones, so in a way I'm glad I didn't have to live through the careful shepherding of A Ven-Tri-Ser that it requires.

I could've said it in a way that doesn't do this, but, well, you're enough like a butterfly as is, no?<br/><br/>If you agree to Bill's current demands, you're basically meat. A meal for him.<br/><br/>Now that he has enough troops to defend against Italy and launch an offensive against me simultaneously... You are not getting Trieste. Period. Now, if you aren't getting Trieste, why would Bill ask you to remove the troops that are threatening him? Well, obviously, to remove that threat. And what is he going to do when you are no longer a threat?<br/><br/>Let me tell you.<br/><br/>Trieste to Adriatic.<br/>Vienna to Trieste.<br/><br/>Then, either a convoy to Apulia, or taking control of the Ionian by either of his current fleets... The situation will change from one where your troops border three of his SCs to one where his troops border two of yours. And, given Bill's advantage in numbers...<br/><br/>Let no one lie to you - as it is, you're going to need luck and/or skill just to survive the coming years. But, when people say that your situation isn't as poor as it seems to be (neglecting to mention exactly how and why it is poor!), they aren't lying.<br/><br/>The deployment of your forces is great for grabbing Austria by the balls, and that's what you should do. There is only [i]real[/i] thing that's stopping you from it, aside from this now substance-less (how are you going to get your SCs, hmm?) idea of Austria-as-ally, namely, possible French aggression. And that one's a non-issue, or at least a easily diplomatically managable issue, especially given France's own current problems. Change that deployment, and your forces are suddenly good for nothing, surrounded on all sides by those of the ally you went to such lengths to keep.<br/><br/>So, this is what you do: Demand immediate concessions, then attack him anyway.<br/><br/>You need an SC and you also need to keep the Ionian - demand Greece. Bill's got enough SCs and avenues for growth as it is, so if he denies you Greece, which is as much an italian SC as it as an austrian one...<br/><br/>Attack Trieste with support from Tyrolia. One of two things will happen - Bill will defend, and will keep out of the Adriatic for now; OR Bill will take the Adriatic, which is bad, but you'll take Trieste, and either keep it or have him commit to retaking it.<br/><br/>This turn, forget Tunisia. Go there now, and you have to sit there for the next turn to keep it, and you'll quite likely lose the Ionian (the gateway to everything Italian!) as soon as you vacate it. Power abhors a vaccuum. Either go somewhere useful, or go somewhere not-so-useful where you can expect a bounce back to the Ionian.<br/><br/>You're small enough now that any sort of petty aggression that you perform isn't aggression at all - it's simply you defending yourself vigorously.<br/><br/><br/>As for my own requests... Given Austria's and Russia's current plans toward me, I'd like you to order F Ionian Sea - Greece regardless of what Bill's answer to your demand would be. That would stop their attack on one of my core SCs, and would leave my army in position to support you into Greece next year, as well against Serbia, which can be usefil in Trieste-related endevours. It's a zero risk move for you - you either keep the Ionian this turn or get Greece. If you keep the Ionian this turn, you can either take Tunisia the next, or commit it to some other maneuver.<br/><br/>Don't *be* the thin veneer of politeness everyone is exhibiting here. Be the raging aggression hidden under it!<br/><br/>Where are my SCs going to come from this year?<br/>How am I going to show him that he ought to keep his promises next time?<br/>I wonder if anyone will expect it if I do THIS?<br/><br/>These are the questions you need to ask yourself before you even begin negotiations with anyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calculus" title="Calculus"><img alt="Calculus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calculus">Calculus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304955/#Comment_304955" name="Item_145" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-17T04:12:38+00:00" title="December 17, 2010  4:12AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul T, my names Daniel. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n<br/>\nPeter, if you invade Burgundy this spring.

Seems generally solid in the west, although I'll be in trouble with the Frenchman if there's no more forthcoming pressure from Germany. Meanwhile Austria assaults Italy in a savage manner; Venice is lost, so Italy'll have to regroup fast, especially as the fleet's stuck in Tunis for the fall. Turkey is sweeping the Black Sea - the east will be a clash between Austria and Turkey after the giants finish with their lesser neighbours, it seems.<br><br>Quick notes for the situation:<ul><li>Italy should at least consider a relaxed stab at Marseilles; it'll be difficult for France to commit a defense right now, as the troops are needed elsewhere, and it's not immediately obvious that the army can actually help out against the Austrian this year. The passive position and defects in the naval defense will come to cost Italy dearly.</li><li>Germany will have a very strong year, two builds seems like a given. Meanwhile the other western Powers sit on their hands.</li><li>Turkey can do whatever the Sultan wants this fall, as Austria has other things on her mind. Destruction of the Russian fleet is probably a consideration.</li><li>Germany is probably going strongest on the board at the moment, with an immense offensive momentum - the French line is completely open, there are already builds in the pipeline and Warsaw is also an easy nut to crack. Nothing can be denied to the Kaiser right now, and he probably should strike when the iron is hot and the opposition scattered.</li><li>Russia is in trouble: England and Germany are harassing her in the Nordic area, with little diplomatic respite in evidence after the Czarinna chose to send the fleets to the Atlantic coasts. Meanwhile Turkey is pressuring her hard down south; a Russia haunted on both fronts will usually crumble quickly and thoroughly.</li><li>It'll be interesting to see how Austria plays that Italian war: if there's will to compromise against the Turk there, a move such as Gre-Ion could finish Italy practically immediately. Definitely a knife, meet throat -type situation there.</li></ul> </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304968/#Comment_304968" name="Item_147" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-17T07:33:07+00:00" title="December 17, 2010  7:33AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Peter: good moves, but I'm concerned with your lack of aggressive positioning regarding France. As you can see on the map, Calculus decided to fight me for Brest, which means that I'm basically unable to advance against him even as I need to keep the naval front against the Russian northern fleet. Your aid against the Frenchman is dearly needed; what say you, do you intend to move forward on that front to relieve me? The situation is dangerous, as your lack of aggression already forces me to choose between defending Brest and keeping the French fleet bottled in the Mediterranean. Failure in either part will soon close the window you have on the soft continental flank in Burgundy, as France either builds a new army or gets an opportunity to bring army Portugal back home; next year France will be a considerably more difficult a target.<br/><br/>Good moves otherwise, you're looking out for number one well enough. I'll get back into Norway in the fall and you'll go into Sweden, after which the rest of the Nordic theater is basically child's play; I'll be in haste to turn at least one fleet down south next year, and I might have to ask you to loan StP to me for the year to compensate for my poor fortunes in the French war, but basically there's nothing truly difficult going on in that front.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calculus" title="Calculus"><img alt="Calculus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calculus">Calculus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304972/#Comment_304972" name="Item_148" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-17T08:11:34+00:00" title="December 17, 2010  8:11AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Peter, I appreciate the non-attack.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304974/#Comment_304974" name="Item_149" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-17T08:15:34+00:00" title="December 17, 2010  8:15AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, that was a bit of a Cassandra moment for me... Sorry you weren't around, Paul - or for not having said something earlier. Try talking to the German - ally or no ally, he might not like seeing Austria grow that fast.<br/><br/>Willows, as I said more than once, I am not interested in extended hostilities with you. The situation is currently in my favour, obviously, and I am expecting to own both Rum and Sev eventually. But I am uninterested in having more than that. Furthermore, I don't see a need to have you surrender them both to me this turn - with my fleet-heavy force, I am unlikely to benefit from your early destruction beyond those two SCs, anyway.<br/><br/>How about I take Rum with my current Sev Fleet? The only unit you then lose is the fleet that makes me keep such a force against your borders in the first place. That would free up either one or both of your armies for defense against the western incursion.<br/><br/>You have an alternative of trying to keep both Rum and Sev somehow, but, really, that's only a stopgap solution, and it'd only tie up both of our forces while our common neighbours grow.<br/><br/>I am worried about Austria, obviously. You probably aren't, yet, as you need to deal with the German and the English before Austria's current growth becomes a problem. Mind though - if you're planning on gaining any new SCs now that the way to Turkey is mostly blocked, you probably won't find SCs more accessible than Vienna or Budapest while the Austrian is dealing with the italian. I myself would be quite content jostling in the Mediterranean, with the help of the italian fleet, if Paul's willing.<br/><br/>So, basically, I exercise restraint right now, and you either defend, or commit a token force to, say, Galicia.<br/><br/><br/>Bill, you brilliant bastard! I'm stuck here watching all your carnage and growth and I can't do a thing about it! I am shaking my fist at you vigorously!<br/><br/><br/>Oh, and a random thought: somebody in the West should think about building some fleets soon, or at least support the Russian's.

I don't claim to be all that great a player--I've never won a solo victory, for example--but I have some experience and I pay attention whenever Eero talks.<br/><br/>So my problem at the end of 1901 is that I see Italian troops lined up on my borders, and I don't want them there. As I'm thinking about what to build, it occurs to me that an aggressive Italian player could conceivably mount a credible attack on Trieste in Fall 1902 by ordering Ion-Adr in the spring, standing fast in Tyrolia and Venice, and then using those three units to pound on my city. It would be a gamble for Italy, sure, but if Italy doubled down on Trieste while I marched off to the east, I'd be sunk. I didn't think that was very likely, to be sure, but it was a <i>possibility</i>, and building a fleet was the only way to have the resources to prevent it. By the same token, it occurred to me that if <i>I</i> wanted to have a shot at Venice in 1902, I needed a fleet in the Adriatic, plus armies in Tyrolia and Trieste--because I knew I'd be facing two defending armies. So as long as I built a fleet, I'd have the option of Tri-Adr, either as a defensive or an offensive move.<br/><br/>But the attack on Venice couldn't happen if Tyrolia was still occupied by the Italians. I couldn't force him out (not if I wanted a fleet, which I did), but I knew Paul already felt like Ven-Tyr in Spring 01 was a little over-aggressive, and so might re-deploy west or south if it felt to him like that was a safe move. So I posted a message that (a) emphasized the belligerence of the Italian posture, (b) appealed to Germany for support for evacuating Tyrolia, and (c) mentioned the Key Lepanto acrostic directed at Paul in my first message, which I thought would be a little disarming. And if I decided not to maneuver against Venice, all of those things would go some distance toward de-escalating the conflict with Italy, which was also a strategic possibility. I sent messages emphasizing the necessity of Italy <i>backing off</i> for any cooperation to take place, and stating definitively that I would <i>defend</i> Trieste, suggesting a static kind of holding the line rather than an aggressive counter-attack.<br/><br/>However, Paul's reply to me suggested that he was still interested in Trieste, which didn't make me happy, since I thought we'd settled that. And he started talking to Turkey and Russia about combining with them against me, so he might get an appealing offer of one kind or another. Luckily, the Russo-Turkish conflict meant that they really only had eyes on each other. Daumantas' late message to Paul was correct in spirit, although he didn't scope out the actual plan. If he'd insisted that Italy absolutely 100% needed to hold on to Tyrolia, I might have gone back to Plan B, which was Vie S Bud-Tri.<br/><br/>Once the fleet was built, there were still problems, though. If I decided to push for Tyrolia from Vienna, how would I keep Trieste safe? Conceivably, Ven-Tyr cuts Tyr S Ven-Tri, the most likely Italian attack in the spring (since it sets up Tyr-Ven, Tri S Tyr-Ven in the fall), but it would be embarrassing to charge into Tyr only to have the Italian army counter-march into Trieste. Another defense is Ser S Tri or Bud S Tri, but that means that my fleet doesn't contest the Adriatic if Italy goes that route, so now I need two armies: one to move in, and the other to support the move. All of a sudden this was turning into a big production, and didn't I need forces in the east? Hadn't I committed in a big way to helping Russia?<br/><br/>As it turns out, not so much. All I needed was one unit to cut Bul S Rum if it were ordered (and as it turned out, it wasn't--Daumantas, knowing where the hammer would fall--the perils of open communication--cleverly <i>abandoned</i> Rum to take Sev). That meant I could use everything else to push easterly, and see where it got me.<br/><br/>Wargaming the potential outcomes, the most favorable was what happened: I get Tyr and Adr, and am positioned for a 3-to-2 attack on Venice in the fall. A more aggressive Italian might have played Tyr-Tri, Ven S Tyr-Tri <i>without</i> Ion-Adr (either because Ion-Gre or because of anxiety over Tunis), in which case Tri is empty in the fall but still pretty safe. I would have forgotten about attacking Venice and concentrated on stabilizing the line in Trieste, possibly heading to Ion in the fall (expecting Ion-Tun at that point). Adding Ion-Adr to the mix keeps my fleet in port but the Adriatic remains clear, and Trieste is still safe. I'd try again for the Adr in the fall, since at that point Ion-Tun would be a necessity. So the <i>safest</i> course of action, given the enemy disposition I was looking at, was to press hard against Italy's forces with an eye toward setting up an attack on Venice but mainly in the interest of protecting Trieste.<br/><br/>So that's what happened from my perspective. I don't like revealing so much of my planning process, since obviously it provides insights into my psychology of play, but I think it's important for Paul to see how the <b>situation on the board</b> and the <b>psychology of the players</b> combine in a player's head to shape decision-making. It's not personal; it's just <i>Diplomacy</i>. The moment Army Venice moved to Tyrolia, Paul and I were tangled in a ludic psychodrama in which the moves took place on both boards: the game-board and the message board. Even now, other players' supposedly "neutral commentary" is entirely strategic, intended to highlight the elements of the situation that favor their interests rather than to truly explain what happened. And even this message has a strategic purpose, as much as I might try to disavow it--I want Paul to be open to the possibility that our war is now over, and that going forward on the basis of the reality on the ground might permit us to work together to further mutual strategic interests.

You, well, you're not so much trying to instill particular emotions as you're attempting a 'cooling' process of sorts, directing him to second order (in relation to the current game) things as general lessons about the game.<br/><br/>This is quite possibly the coolest thing ever.<br/><br/>Though, of course, we don't have to depend on psychological means alone while trying to accomplish psychological ends.

If you let me keep Rumania at least for the turn, I can try to scramble some sort of defense up north.  If you go one further and vacate Sevastopol (Arm-Ank, Sev-Arm?), it would be amazingly helpful, but it's not really a level of generosity I expect.<br/><br/>Peter-<br/><br/>So, what's it going to be?  If you go for Sweden, England keeps Norway.  Norway falls anyway, but if you leave Sweden alone, I at least have somewhere worthwhile to retreat.<br/><br/>Fortunately for you, England won't be getting any builds this turn (unless he stabs you for Belgium or Holland).  You've got what it takes to outgrow England, and secure a loyal ally in the north, who cannot effectively stab you the way England can.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305026/#Comment_305026" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-17T16:30:52+00:00" title="December 17, 2010  4:30PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, does it really matter which I leave at your disposal, Sev or Rum?

You, well, you're not so much trying to instill particular emotions as you're attempting a 'cooling' process of sorts, directing him to second order (in relation to the current game) things as general lessons about the game.<br/><br/>This is quite possibly the coolest thing ever.</blockquote>\nThat is a great insight. This is why I love playing with you, Daumantas. By the way, let me just say I loved this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted by Daumantas</cite>Don't *be* the thin veneer of politeness everyone is exhibiting here. Be the raging aggression hidden under it!</blockquote>\nNow that's a philosophy of play! Back to business:\n<blockquote>Though, of course, we don't have to depend on psychological means alone while trying to accomplish psychological ends. Take the pure strategy level, for instance.<br/><br/>Bill, tell us one good reason why you would have to stop your troops where they are and advance no further into Paul's territory.</blockquote>\nAh, now we come to it! But there's a couple of good reasons:<br/><br/>(1) A potential Turkish push into the Mediterranean. Don't deny it, D. You know you want to. You know you need to. Your navy-heavy force structure makes that the obvious next step for you. Even if you and I try to work something out, the logic of the game and your own aggressiveness means that we'll clash on that issue; to even bring you to the negotiating table means that the reality on the ground has to be such that you can't just take what you want. Notice that in the case of a successful Turkish breakout, the Italian peninsula is right in your path, and so Paul has an interest (even if he doesn't recognize it yet) in keeping you contained. <br/><br/>More importantly:<br/><br/>(2) Italy's own armies, and the geography of the Italian peninsula. You make it sound like I just march down the peninsula and grab the peninsular cities with a mere wave of my hand: "Onward, soldiers, onward!" But Rome and Naples are mutually defensible, if Paul can get troops there. It would take a huge commitment of time and force to root out a determined defender--time that I am unlikely to be given.<br/><br/>Taken together, the two create a compelling case for me to try to make common cause with Paul rather than pursuing his forces to their ultimate destruction. Note that right now what I expect Paul to do is to defend his cities as best he can. Ideally, he'd withdraw south to defend Rome and Naples; something like Ven-Apu, Pie-Tus might allow Tus-Rom, Apu S Tus-Rom in the spring.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not saying I won't push the attack--just that Paul's moves on both boards still matter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305041/#Comment_305041" name="Item_156" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-17T21:22:16+00:00" title="December 17, 2010  9:22PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting, folks.<br/><br/>It seems I was away from the boards at the wrong time.<br/><br/>I would love to hear the other players' thoughts on my situation, as well, and possible move-sets. All in the spirit of education, of course, but make a strong argument for why Italy should do something that's ultimately in your favour, and I may be quite likely to do as you say.<br/><br/>Peter, we started this game off on a friendly foot, and your position is quite secure. A powerful Austria on your borders is not particularly good for you. Would you consider getting involved on my side--say, to push Austria out of Tyrolia (not a bad thing for him, if he's really as friendly and as concerned about his Eastern war as he claims, but helpful for my defense)? Any suggestions are welcome! But I think it would be more in your favour to have two reasonably balanced powers on your Southern borders than one aggressive giant, so I'd love to hear your thoughts on this topic.

Specifically, leaving the north-eastern borders unmanned is a solid choice when Russia has plenty of enemies elsewhere and Rumania is being manned by fleets; Budapest fares quite well without a home guard, and the forces can therefore be put to use elsewhere. Building a fleet is also a very promising idea for Austria, who traditionally has a weak naval capacity.<br><br>Trying to get Germany to interfere in Italy's favour is a good idea - it's true that Germany has an interest in reining Austria in long-term, as the two Powers are natural contestants for continental supremacy from the late middle-game onwards. On the other hand, attacking Austria is a very large undertaking for Germany, in many ways much larger than attacking any of his other neighbours due to the geography involved and the lengths he has to go to to score a profit out of the war. Germany has a surplus force next year, so it could happen, and it'd go a long way towards relieving Italy; definitely the right tack for Paul to pursue.<br><br>It's true that Turkey has a naval emphasis to his force make-up, and therefore he has a natural inclination for making peace with Austria and attacking west through the Mediterranean once he's settled the current brouhaha with Russia. This is simply because the fleets would otherwise be left underused, while he doesn't really have enough armies to wage a serious continental war. Austria, on the other hand, may quite reasonably wage war over the Black Sea environs with mere armies, and one potential target for the Turkish fleets is Greece, so it's not exactly a certainty that Turkey would turn on Italy over the next few years. Basically Austria would have to relinquish claims to the Black Sea territories and Greece - then those two would have a very natural set-up for a long-term alliance.<br><br>I've been analyzing the French position, and my current thinking is that France probably can't afford to cover Marseilles on the fall move. It's a bit of a psych game, as covering the place is profitable for France only if there's nigh-certain knowledge that Italy's going to attack there. Italy, meanwhile, has only long-term concerns for the Piedmont army down south; it's a defensible choice to retreat and use the army in the hypothetical defensive land-war against Austria, but it's also a very lucrative option to attack Marseilles and hope for a gain that'd offset losing Venice. It's almost a pure prisoner's dilemma, as the tactical catastrophe for France would be considerable if he misguesses either way. Exactly the sort of situation where you need to make the choice based on the long-term tactical synergy of the resulting position, or perhaps a random roll to ensure that the opposition can't outcalculate you.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calculus" title="Calculus"><img alt="Calculus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calculus">Calculus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305052/#Comment_305052" name="Item_159" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-18T06:21:36+00:00" title="December 18, 2010  6:21AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The beauty of A MUN-TYR is that it does NOT require to start Germany in a long term fight with Austria.

Not a sure thing, but might well succeed. Could even be that you'll support me in there, yes? I do need a build from somewhere one of these days, what with the French pressure and all; leaving the entire Nordic to you isn't feasible unless I start advancing down south instead of losing ground as seems to be the case right now.<br/><br/>Regarding Sweden, no reason whatsoever to leave it to Willow. Even if you wanted to work together with Russia, at this point it'll have to be on your terms, not hers; we take the Nordic realm (which, note, traditionally includes StP insofar as the geography goes) and decimate the Russian fleet and harbors, you stab me for something perhaps if you get impatient, then Russia makes peace or crumbles, depending on her play down south. The ship already sailed as far as the Russian northern strategy goes when she opted to wrassle England and Turkey simultaneously, so the question at this point is whether you have common interests after StP falls, not whether you'd want to leave her any Nordic possessions. Considering the fleet force arrayed against her in the Nordic area, Russia's best interest at this point lies in seeking compensatory victories on the continent, which might be something Germany could help her with by running interference.<br/><br/>I don't really have a horse in the race (aside from my desire to see Germany step into action against France), but I think that Mun-Tyr is a strategically nice move, but tactically meaningless; there's no way Austria won't attack Tyr-Ven, in which case the Mun army won't cut a support, but will rather move itself into Tyrolia. This probably isn't smart unless you're planning to spare the army (and ideally a second one off your new builds, if you want to actually accomplish anything) against Austria for a bit longer term. In any case the move doesn't change the immediate Italian strategy, as Venice'll fall whether Germany interferes or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305067/#Comment_305067" name="Item_167" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-18T10:04:05+00:00" title="December 18, 2010 10:04AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: PeterBB</cite><a href="/forums/profile/Willow">@Willow</a>: Talk to me about why I'd want to forgo a build and leave you Sweden?</blockquote>\nBecause you gain the services two friendly fleets already in position up north.

Eero suggests Pie-Mar as a gamble a canny Italian player might make, which essentially grabs France by the hair from behind and slides a knife across his neck. But Eero doesn't care if Paul orders Pie-Mar or not; he just wants Daniel to <i>think it's likely,</i> and defend against it. That lets him leave Brest unsupported and order Eng-MAO to keep the French fleet bottled up in the Med and an entire French army idling in Portugal. Eero would have to think that Daniel had nerves of steel if he thought the French player wouldn't cover Marseilles in the current situation. Meanwhile, Daniel suggests Mun-Tyr to cut Tyr S Tri-Ven, thus saving Venice for Italy--as long as A Pie goes east not west! When Peter steps up to say that he's willing to order Mun-Tyr Eero steps back in, since that will <i>guarantee</i> no Pie-Mar, to show that such a move is easily countered. Ultimately, however, Daniel has to decide if Paul is the kind of a guy who'd kick a man when he's down after having been kicked himself. For Paul, the choice of Pie-Mar or not must have a greater resonance: it shows whether the moral abyss that is the game of <i>Diplomacy</i> has made inroads upon his soul. Of course, from a rational perspective, he can tell himself that a France that's still kicking against England--however feebly--is a bulwark against the English fleet, while France's death means that Italy will soon be fighting England somewhere. But the decision Pie-Mar or no Pie-Mar is more than merely the product of strategic calculations and considerations--it has moral-pragmatic/aesthetic weight as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305119/#Comment_305119" name="Item_169" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-19T07:48:18+00:00" title="December 19, 2010  7:48AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Retreats aren't in yet, but nothing can retreat to a supply center, so yearly results are in.<br/><br/>Germany is the year's big winner, pulling up to an impressive 7 centers, and projecting force west and northeast.

There's probably a limited window of time before the Mediterranean becomes an Austrian zone, and I need to counteract that.<br/><br/>Willows, that army of yours in Galicia brings me joy!<br/><br/>Aside from the actual threat to my current core rival, there's the extra fun bit of Bill having to defend his home centers, thus slowing down the pace of him building new troops if the SC gain rate is high. It will also draw a chunk of the Austrian's forces there, which might have the sideeffect of a fallout between Germany and Austria (armies tend to go the shortest route), which is probably inevitable eventually, given the good fortunes both Austria and Germany are facing. I'd be fairly happy about that!<br/><br/>We don't yet have any possibilities of troop cooperation, which is just as well, with public diplomacy... But, if possible, I'd like to request that you perform no hostilities against me in the coming year. Knowing that Bulgaria is free to give uncut support opens up various possibilities for me and puts the pressure of uncertainty on Bill.

I'm pleasantly surprised to see how well I did.  I'm willing to support you into Bulgaria again- Daumantas can't both attack me and defend the center.</blockquote>\nWillow --<br/><br/>I applaud the move for its ferocious initiative--it certainly makes me want to keep you happy. But I suspect that once you start thinking about your spring moves, you're going to wish you hadn't done it--on your own account, that is to say, rather than mine. If A Gal was still in Ukr, you could defend both StP and Sev with two units each by scuttling the Atlantic fleet and rebuilding in Moscow. That would have let you order Mos S StP, Ukr S Sev and Rum S Ser-Bul costlessly, and I would have happily ordered Bud S Rum to keep our lines intact. Still, no sense bemoaning might-have-beens.<br/><br/>Now you've promised to support an attack on Bulgaria, but if Daumantas knows it's coming, there's no reason for him not to attack Sevastopol. But if he thinks you might defend Sevastopol with Rum S Sev, he's got a knottier problem--he could order Arm-Sev, Bla S Arm-Sev, but it would fail. So he could go ahead and order Bul-Rum to cut the support and make the attack succeed, but then he's got to worry that I'll attack Bulgaria. He could be willing to trade Sevastopol for Bulgaria, but maybe he's not.<br/><br/>Another option for Turkey is Bul-Rum, Bla S Bul-Rum, but Gal S Rum prevents that. Note that Bul-Rum doesn't cut Rum S Ser-Bul unless Rum is dislodged, in which case it is possible for Bul-Rum, Bla S Bul-Rum combined with something like Aeg-Bul(sc) to both take Rumania from you and keep Bulgaria from me.<br/><br/>So maybe it's best to say that, instead of definitely ordering Rum S Ser-Bul, you'll keep Rum S Ser-Bul in your possible order mix, just like I'll keep Ser-Bul in my possible order mix. That means that Daumantas can't automatically select the optimal counter-moves to our orders while at the same time preserving the possibility of us coordinating an attack in a way that our opponent will find disconcerting.

No biggie, though, misjudgments happen to all of us in this business of Great Powers.<br><br>Speaking of Great Powers, I have to strenuously disagree with the Franco-Russian libel that's been making the rounds lately regarding the peaceful and only moderately expansive British empire. It's a fact of record that despite these vile insinuations the great peoples of England and Germany are in fact getting along famously well; we've even demilitarized North Sea, the veritable high road to the heart of our little empire, all in an effort to convince the Kaiser to keep focusing on the continental matters. I would be dearly sorry if these baseless rumours convinced our good friends - cousins, practically - to start a fleet build-up now that the need is so clearly less than ever before. We're dancing to the same tune, the Kaiser and I, and nothing would bring me pleasure than to continue our mutual disarmament by moving my fleets away from the Low Countries (rightful German allies as they are) altogether just as soon as it's practicable.<br><br>(I know that I'm harping on fleet build-ups all the time, but that's playing England, that is: I'm basically friend to all the forest animals who won't slash two trunks together to make a raft. I'd even befriend the Frenchies if the got rid of that Spanish fleet and left the Atlantic seas to whomever they rightfully belong - namely, myself.)                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305328/#Comment_305328" name="Item_190" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-21T06:54:10+00:00" title="December 21, 2010  6:54AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero: For the record, I am in fact getting a bit nervous.

In this sort of situation it's important to analyze and understand the internal forces of opposing empires: who will strive to benefit, and what sort of forces can they commit, and for how long? This logic will then reveal which objectives will have to be relinquished gracefully, which international currents encouraged and where to set the line. I often encourage an entirely desperate Italy to set up the final redoubt in the Rom-Nap SC pair, but is our Italy already there, or is something more to be done yet? At least the northern unit will probably do well to move to Tyrolia or Marseilles, becoming a rogue mercenary unit available for use by anybody willing to provide it a temporary home; the unit in question is probably too far from the home SCs to participate in the defence effectively for the time being.</li><li>Germany is now the big man of Europe, both materially and (more significantly) strategically, with ample choice of direction. The war with France seems fruitful, especially if Italy's rogue army in Piedmont is courted and a sufficient German force is detached for the purpose; Gascony is the weak point for France, as it's difficult to protect the place from attacks and retreats even while Picardy is seeing off enemy forces. Although the distance is longer, Russia provides fruitful prospects as well: a decisive two-army attack on Warsaw is a possibility right this year. Finally, interfering in the Austrian affairs down south might prove strategically very prudent, Austria being the main continental contender from the Kaiser's viewpoint; no immediate profits in terms of SCs as in the former two options, but perhaps a greater strategic fruit if an intervention succeeds in deadlocking the eastern situation altogether. Germany easily has the strength to pursue two of these three courses of action, so it'll be interesting to see which the Kaiser decides to pass on!</li><li>France built a fleet in Marseilles, which basically means that there is a hope of breaking the Atlantic bounce that's been going on for a while with England. The price, however, is heavy, as the defense of the metropolitan France is left to two armies against up to 4-5 German armies. Besides, the new fleet'll take a year to deploy, and much can happen in that time. Perhaps an excursion in Italy would be in order, instead, to garner foreign influence?</li><li>Russia is losing StP, it seems, so it's probably not as useful to contest the matter as it is to move quickly to other affairs. To me it seems that a quick, bilateral disarmament along the Turkish border would be to the benefit of the Czarina, but whether the Sultan agrees is another matter entirely. If such could be accomplished, there are options regarding the cluster of SCs neighboring Rumania; this is a traditional source of success for Russia, who can be surprisingly quick in taking control of the Rum-Bud-Vie "toppings" of the Austrian empire when the timing is right.</li><li>Turkey has come down grievously from the formerly dominant Black Sea position, and is in fact merely overbearing at the moment; still secure, but unlikely to make any progress against the Russian defense. Meanwhile Austria is more than ready to confound any assault. I might personally try a misleading Arm-Bul, Bul-Gre attack, but that's more because I believe that the corner Powers should be played with risky moves to leverage their defensive advantage than because of any great hope of success.</li><li>Finally, the Austrian position is the second-most lucrative one on the market (or rather, off the market, crowns being rarely sold), as the Italian fruit ripens and the solid continental position is bulwarked by a rare Austrian dominance of the Mediterranean; half of the fleets in the eastern parts are Austrian at the moment. New enemies are a possibility, as Germany has a strategic interest in curtailing Austria and Russia and Turkey are thawing their relations, but as long as the risks do not discourage the Emperor too much, there's every reason to expect modest gains to continue in Italy and the east.</li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305349/#Comment_305349" name="Item_196" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-21T07:48:23+00:00" title="December 21, 2010  7:48AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 21, 2010 7:52AM by PeterBB.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Deleted to think a bit more)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calculus" title="Calculus"><img alt="Calculus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calculus">Calculus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305372/#Comment_305372" name="Item_197" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-21T09:35:37+00:00" title="December 21, 2010  9:35AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, a little fortitude and a little ambiguity!<br/>\n<br/>\nAustria, though in a powerful position, is sitting on top of many dilemmas, and can't cover all of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor one thing, Turkey's fleet Aegean could take Greece with support from Bulgaria, or it could could support you into the Ionian.

An offer from any other nation would probably mean that you'd be the one offering up the rope, with no recompse forthcoming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305400/#Comment_305400" name="Item_200" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-21T11:54:20+00:00" title="December 21, 2010 11:54AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 21, 2010 11:54AM by Willow.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daumantas-<br><br>The convoy switch is much riskier than it is for me, which is why I'm asking for something in the way of insurance.  Not unreasonable, no?<br><br>Now this convoy proposal of yours, that's actually rather interesting.  Like Eero said, corner powers need to take greater risks because they have more to lose.  If I trust this crazy scheme of yours (crazy like a fox?), I have to ask myself, what do I get out of it?  You get quite a bit out of it- a eastern army redeployed to the front, wherever that may be, and a new center to boot.  I get your army off my east flank, which is valuable to me, but it's on my west flank instead (which is less threatening, since you have other places to go), but I lose a center, which is costly to me.<br><br>I'm considering the proposal, as an alternative to slow stagnation, but I'm curious if you can sweeten the pot to make it a strong strategy.<br><br>-Willow                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p3" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p3" rel="prev">3</a><a class="Highlight p-4" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p4">4</a><a class=" p-5" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p5" rel="next">5</a><a class=" p-6" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p6">6</a><a class=" p-7" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p7">7</a><span class="Ellipsis">\u2026</span><a class=" p-19 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p19">19</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p5" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F13448%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F13448%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[Diplomacy] Story Games League, Game 6 - Page 5 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p5" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="[Diplomacy] Story Games League, Game 6 - Page 5" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p5" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Eero- You do quite a bit to make me laugh.

Still allied with the German?  It's certainly possible he's still allied with you, having decided not to build fleets, but let's look at your decision matrix, shall we?  Having disbanded Picardy,  to get units to fight France and out of Scandinavia, you'd have to order<br/><br/>Spring<br/>NWG-NAO<br/>(Norway and Finland pursue some fool expedition in English adventurism)<br/>ENG-MAO (likely bounce)<br/><br/>Fall<br/>ENG S NAO-MAO<br/>NAO-MAO<br/>Nwy-NTH (breaking a DMZ, otherwise you have to go all the way around England.)<br/><br/>And for what?  Finally getting the Mid Atlantic?  France will have fallen by the time you can level an assault on Brest.

Let's not fall for that, shall we? I think both of us have bigger problems at the moment than fighting over Marseilles. A war between us at this point would most likely give Eero extra leverage over you (he has, after all, also been trying to convince Germany to head as quickly as possible in your direction!), and Austria certain victory over me. I don't see you or I coming out ahead in such a situation, but rather feeding the English and Austrian powers as they grow fat.<br/><br/>As you have seen for yourself, I do not intent to take Marseilles from you, or I would have done so earlier. So, rest easy. I'm not attacking you from the East; you can go about whatever business you have elsewhere. I don't expect you to trust me on this point immediately, but my actions will bear out what I'm saying here.

(Note that there is no further easternly ambition in this for me, and I'm planning to lease the place to the Kaiser later on, anyway - taking StP is strictly a temporary arrangement from my viewpoint, but necessary because I can't get rid of your hostile fleet in any other way.) It's true that it'll take me a little while to achieve complete shift of focus back to the south, but then I'm confident that the Franco-German war for the Burgundy plains won't be an extremely quick affair, either; I'm doing my part just by keeping the French Iberian forces committed, and the fact that I'm able to do this with just one fleet is a fortunate tactical detail, not a secret sign of my true intent. I'll be back in business against France with reneved vigour (assuming we don't achieve a peaceful understanding) in 1905 at the latest.<br/><br/>All that being said, I am of course always willing to rethink and renegotiate based on the current board position. For example, Peter probably understands quite well that if he makes a quick work of France while I conquer StP then it'll make more sense for our continuing cooperation for me to keep my Nordic possessions, perhaps even trading Sweden from him, than to do a great big shuffle just so we can stick to the original plan. It all depends on who makes the greatest progress and where, you see; while a good partnership does require somewhat equal strength ratios, nothing says that we can't be flexible about who owns what and where, exactly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305419/#Comment_305419" name="Item_205" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-21T12:54:04+00:00" title="December 21, 2010 12:54PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Willows -<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would you want, then?

An army in Tyrolia would guarantee you a "buffer", requiring Austria to give you a turn's notice, and thus show his hand, before attacking any of your central SCs. In the meantime, from there you would have access to three SCs, should your interest turn that way in the future and should any of them lie open.<br><br>If Italy survives, it is even possible that you might be able to make such a grab with my support in the future. Please consider it!

A very aggressive push by Germany towards the east, Austria loses Venice in a curious shift of focus, and the Russo-Turkish war continues unabated. Whee!<br/><br/>Let's consider the situation...<br/><br/>It occurs to me that Germany is approaching a rather overwhelming position, what with the devastating attack in the east and the handy siege of Paris; good work in that regard. I wonder if Austria might consider a surprise stab at Munich, or whether other Powers in general will see the wisdom in curbing the Kaiser's ambition somehow. For instance, were I myself member of the venerable eastern triangle, I would probably consider a peace with Russia most seriously; the English attack on StP and the German assault on Warsaw are both unblockable developments that will leave Russia in ruin, resulting in a power vacuum that Germany will fill most handily, should Willow be allowed to fall.<br/><br/>(Concerning the above, it might be prudent to note that the British crown stands, as always, solidly on the side of our dear friends in Germany. This is obviously because we lack the most elementary means of contesting the events in the east, even while the French premiership has chosen to invest in weapons that may only be used against our fair island. My hands are tied, verily, no matter how inconvenient a German solo victory would be at this juncture.)<br/><br/>France's decision of letting us into the Mid-Atlantic is most likely not a sign of interest in Tunis, one should note, but rather a declaration of intent to force their own way into the very same, strategically significant sea zone. This limits my own options considerably, as I'll be forced to seize StP for the immediate defensive capabilities it offers for the fair Albion against the superior French fleet. (Shame that Willow decided to defend the undefensible; I'd have considerably more leeway in my moves this turn if StP had fallen in the spring already.) On the other hand, France might find the price of keeping me out of Iberia too high after all in the event of an Atlantic thrust, so I guess that a Tunisian detour is not entirely out of the question. The only certainty is that any way you cut it, Daniel has his work cut out in defending the French home SCs from the Kaiser, who has a terrifying number of possible attack vectors against all three French home SCs - difficult to predict, difficult to defend, probably a smart idea to seek peace with the English.<br/><br/>The new Italian position is interesting, as the Austrian threat has receded slightly, allowing Italy some options. This is not to say that Paul's not still royally fucked if Austria chooses to take the Ionian Sea and continue along those lines, but perhaps a diplomatic solution is possible - how else to explain the Austrian withdrawal? The eastern tactical concerns are an unlikely explanation, as Turkey and Russia remain ill-positioned to wage war on the Red Emperor. With the German initiative against Russia it's more clear than ever that Austria remains a safely dominant eastern Power, at least until German attentions turn towards annexing the ethnic bits of the double monarchy.<br/><br/>I didn't like the Turkish timidity in the Black Sea affair last year, but these new developments are once again seeming interesting. The smart Sultan will probably force the Russian fleet to disband from Rumania, as that minimizes the actual damage on the Russian core provinces, enabling the Czarinna to proffer solid resistance against the encroaching western interests. Besides, the resulting position against Austria wouldn't be bad, either; for good or ill, Turkey is the wrench in any European plan for harmony, and even if the Sultan might desire peace that'd allow Austria to turn against Germany - how could such a conceit be credible when Turkey needs to grow and prosper, too, even when it may only do so at the expense of his neighbours?<br/><br/>All in all, interesting developments. We're rapidly approaching the first crux of the game, the point where Germany has a slim chance of grasping the dynamic board by the horns and forcing a quick subdual on the rest of us. Usually the first dominant Power can be restrained by the others, but who knows - the situation seems very tricky to me, especially considering the way Turkey is forced to fight against the Powers most capable of restraining this new German assault on the east. I still wouldn't bet on the Kaiser, as such quick victories are so rare - at least I wouldn't bet on a quick victory, even while a slow one is of course entirely credible, considering how the early dominant Power rarely falls entirely off the horse during the mid-game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305543/#Comment_305543" name="Item_221" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-22T07:34:17+00:00" title="December 22, 2010  7:34AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 22, 2010 8:20AM by Paul_T.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoa.

I'm sure you could use your forces more fruitfully elsewhere, and it's not like I'm actually <i>doing</i> anything harmful there, right - not anything as annoying as I'd be if I were forced to retreat. I'm sure you can see yourself how very little benefit attacking France would be for me right now, speaking of the full strategic view.<br/><br/>Peter: do consider supporting MAO-Bre if you've nothing better in mind for that army in Picardy. That's one attack that's going to be hard to block for the Frenchie, considering the positions in Paris and Marseilles that are also threatened. Also, while we're talking, perhaps the wrong ears aren't listening right now - Liv-Mos is going to be a most effective cutting move from both our viewpoints, so perhaps you'll consider that when prepping your assault on Warsaw, eh?<br/><br/>Paul: may I suggest that you not attack Bill in Trieste this time around? I know that Trieste looks good from the Italian side of the fence, but really - it is in no way a reasonable position to demand a home SC as your price of cooperation from any but the most weakened opponent. They're just too centrally placed for almost all Powers to give away like that. Instead, consider helping Bill out against the Germans, maybe, or help him get his fleets east for a delayed Lepanto movement of some sort. Basically, it seems to me with all of my strategic sight right now that the current board-position favours Austro-Italian peace over petty stabbing. Ask Bill to give you Greece in 1904 to keep you on a growth curve, forbid any movements to the Ionian Sea (encourage Apu-Adr-Alb, rather) and pull yourself together in general. I don't expect peace to last indefinitely as Austria has a second fleet in the game, but you both need it for the next year or two if I'm any judge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305560/#Comment_305560" name="Item_224" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-22T08:23:19+00:00" title="December 22, 2010  8:23AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill,<br/><br/>I've learned enough from my other game of Diplomacy not to hold a pointless grudge.

In fact, I only even added the second set of orders suggestion because I thought it was worse in every regard for you, thus having you reconsider the initial deal... But when you reacted more favourably to it, I could think of only one reason why - moving Armenia opens up a window for Army Sev to slide in and wreak havoc, while simultaneously freeing you up to make actually *lucrative* deals with the Austrian and giving that same Austrian difficulty in conquering my position, what with my two armies there.<br/><br/>If it matters at all, I would have followed through with my initial order suggestion without any incursion to your territory. Such is life!<br/><br/>I don't have much interest in replacing your Rumania fleet with a fleet of my own this year. If an arrangement is possible where I take Rumania, scuttle that fleet, and you remain free to both keep Sev and defend against the German incursion, I'll take it, and, provided Sev remains unoccupied the next year, will provide you with the promise support against Budapest.<br/><br/>Everything is crap for you now, yeah, I know, and I'm sorry for my part in it, but I never really wanted for you to be facing problems of this magnitude. Apologies!<br/><br/><br/>Paul, don't sweat it. Keeping the Ionian Austria-free is a good deal already - you see, once a fleet is there and is forced to retreat, it is almost invariably free to do so in a way that makes the opposing side sweat and curse profusely. Now you have a whole range of tactical and strategic opportunities open to you again, congratulations! You should probably try and make sure that Bill doesn't see you as one of a number of threats... And then attack him anyway. You're the weaker power here, so you can always write it off as defensive aggression - so whether or not your attack succeeds or fails, you can still salvage an alliance of sorts out of it.<br/><br/><br/>Bill... Things are changing! If Russia, as now seems likely, disappears from the map (which, well, I'm hoping it won't, but it will be no mean feat to prevent such!), Turkey becomes way too long and boring slog for Austria to really bother with. I am in no way expecting for you to accept or even acknowledge the proposal, but perhaps you would be interested in an alliance against the German? If he makes gains on a level that is only to be expected, he will certainly need cutting down a peg or two. My only (tentative) request for this to be viable is a bit of a rebalancing of the Mediterranean - specifically, I'd like either myself or the Italian (two neighbours are better than one) to own Greece. Since the Med is the only other way into Turkey, I'd like to make that route somewhat harder to take (not eliminate it!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305569/#Comment_305569" name="Item_226" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-22T09:31:33+00:00" title="December 22, 2010  9:31AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 22, 2010 9:32AM by Willow.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daumantas-<br/><br/>I'm sure you'd get over it.<br/><br/>I'm a little sad the deal didn't go through- one of my fondest Diplomacy memories is convincing England (as Germany) to convoy one of my armies onto the British Isles.

Since it's becoming rather clear, and, really, has been for some time, that Willow is uninterested in being any kind of counterweight to the west, and instead will push her forces south as much and as often as possible, I'd rather just get Russia out of the game and deal with the west personally. Even if this means that Germany will grow faster than it should, this will only act as a signal for other western powers to interfere, meaning that you and I won't be left the ones picking up the slack for no good gain.<br/><br/>Would you consider supporting my fleet into Rumania, or attacking Galicia, or both? I want this particular headache to be over with, and start working on carving may way into Russia proper, where I will most likely meet the Kaiser.<br/><br/>Austria and Turkey are destined to butt heads, this much is true - but that doesn't mean we can't have a few years of a workable alliance until Germany is less of a threat and I don't have to work double-time to get a slab of Russia for myself (and you, well, you've... various other lands you could be invading, no?).<br/><br/>I doubt either of us would want to truly demilitarize our borders, but I'd be happy to keep them the way they are - a bit of a barrier slapped together from armies and fleets, one which we will both half-heartedly try to get through once every while, but will inevitably fail.

Meanwhile Turkey could take Greece (compensating Austria by supporting him to Rumania and/or Sevastopol) and push west to Italy, while the two Austrian fleets are used as support for Turkey and as a strong bulwark against Turkish betrayal; keeping them both in the environs of the Adriatic Sea accomplishes this quite well. As long as Turkey builds fleets and Austria builds armies the pressures shouldn't become too much, and the two can go quite a long ways by simply having Turkey take everything on the coasts of the Mediterranean (excepting Venice), while Austria dominates the Russian areas and harasses Germany.<br/><br/>Then again, it sort of seems that I and Peter are the only ones with a long-term working relationship here. The public diplomacy environment is clearly taking its toll: people can't build up trust by in-depth negotiation, and the lack shows in erratic play and lightly forsaken commitments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305593/#Comment_305593" name="Item_230" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-22T13:27:58+00:00" title="December 22, 2010  1:27PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That eastern triangle situation is actually pretty interesting, let's see...<br/><br/>So, Russia - the way I see it, the only way for Russia to survive the crunch here is to defend Warsaw diligently against my good ally the Kaiser. Russia basically can't do anything about losing StP due to the political pressure of her fleet there - it has to go for us to sleep well in our island stronghold. Similarly, the Rumanian fleet is a constant burden diplomatically between the dominant Turkey and treacherous Russians. The logical play, therefore, is for Russia to trade Rumania to the Turk in exchange for keeping Sevastopol, disband the fleet on retreat and end the year with three SCs: War, Mos and Sev. These three form a relatively stable triplet, especially with three armies defending them and secure flanks; this allows the Czarinna a stable negotiation position against Germany, which can be convinced to turn south towards Austria once it becomes clear that Turkey is not helping the Kaiser penetrate deeper east. Turkey loses the immediate possession of Sevastopol, which is left empty, but gains an ally who can actually stop Germany, and does not need to commit forces into defending Sevastopol. And of course nothing prevents the Sultan from taking Sevastopol later, once the German threat has passed.<br/><br/>The Russian northern flank is pretty much automatically secure in that I can't be stopped, but I won't advance beyond StP, either. The southern situation is trickier, as Turkey might not see a successful defense of Warsaw as an entirely crucial thing, and there's already been talk of advancing Turkish land forces beyond the environs of the Black Sea. The trick in getting the Sultan to agree to trade Sev for Rum and a destroyed Russian fleet is to get the Austrian emperor to enforce the pledge: Bud S Sev-Rum, Ser S Rum H and Gre-Bul ensures that the only way for Turkey to take Rumania even while Russia defends Warsaw is to take the place by an attack from Sevastopol. Austria doesn't even need to make this move in reality as long as the promise to make it is convincing enough, and the threat of repercussions is sufficiently severe to keep the Sultan honest once in his life; the Turk will want to play along in the interest of supporting a viable buffer state against Germany, and managing to play together for once will be of great diplomatic benefit to the Powers of the eastern triangle, who can then continue on to more fruitful plans once the Russian situation stabilizes; whether this is an Austro-Turkish war or an alliance is immaterial when the current foremost concern is stymieing the western Powers by building up Russia as a buffer state. Mere show of immediate goodwill for one turn from all parties can bring peace to the Black Sea and ensure that the bickering in the east does not become a windfall in the western coffers.<br/><br/>All of the above is, of course, merely a theoretical exercise on my part - I rather enjoy seeing my good friend the Kaiser succeed so copiously in his efforts on the continent. By all means, go on fighting each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calculus" title="Calculus"><img alt="Calculus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calculus">Calculus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305598/#Comment_305598" name="Item_231" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-22T13:43:02+00:00" title="December 22, 2010  1:43PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 22, 2010 3:30PM by Calculus.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/>\n<br/>\nPeter has invaded me, ending the peace between our countries.

(Though for obvious reasons you are saying things like, "I can't be stopped" in St.Petersburg, or "I'm firmly ensconced in place" in MOA)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Peter supports the army St. Petersburg this turn (and/or breaks your support), you gain no SC's. No new fleets for either front. Your military is stuck in the boonies and you are tied for the weakest power on the map.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow on my side, if I wish, I can kick my way into MOA this turn and not suffer from your retreat (you can't go med or to any of my SC's). Even if you get a fleet build this turn, after that I'd stand a chance of taking an English home SC in the fall, or at the least tying up two of your fleets.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here's the offical offer, your fleet moves out of MOA this turn under it's own power, and one of my fleets move in. In return, I won't go to NAO, IRS, or ENG until my war Germany is over.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize that MAO is not a place you'd like to see a French fleet. But only one of us can hold it, and my word means a lot more than yours.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus, your that fleet of yours could be elsewhere being Profitable next year.<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\n<br/>\nPeter,<br/>\n<br/>\nYou've invaded me. With only two armies. And red armies to the your south.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm capable of blocking ALL your attacks this fall, should that be move the my coin lands on. And if I choose to primarily fight the English this fall, I'll still be able to block my choice of two out of three SC's. So that gives you, lets say, 1 in 6 total odds of gaining an SC. You could probably use those forces elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your armies leave France, this would remove my need to fight you. You would have a single secure flank.

In addition, if a support for an English attack on Brest is in the move-set, the probability of success is actually 2/3, as that's another move that France cannot block.<br><br>Daniel: I don't believe in words, only in board positions; your capability of waging (largely ineffective, raiding-style) war against England is moderate with your two weakly-committed fleets (fleets that have nothing better to do than wage war on me or secure Marseilles, in other words), while my best interests and current capabilities for war against France are minimal, considering the balance of my forces and the continental board dynamic. Therefore it does not make sense for me to to voluntarily relinquish the current position. I suggest that you defend your extremely vulnerable home SCs, and rearrange your forces; once I get another fleet off StP I'll be able to move out of MAO safely, at which point a demilitarized MAO becomes a real possibility. Hurrying the matter unilaterally will result in nothing but a protracted naval war with no clear goals or rewards; it will be a war that benefits the Kaiser most, but I will be there to reap my share as well when you lose units, the cohesion of your nation breaks and easy targets start to surface in the western parts.<br><br>The Russian offer of mutual assistance with Germany regarding StP is a sham, as the best Russian move in case of Liv S StP H is the same that it'd be otherwise: a full defense of Warsaw. Doesn't seem to me that Germany has better moves than attacking Warsaw: the probability is high that Willow opts to attack Sevastopol, or Turkey attacks Russia from the south, or some other variant happens where the extreme German pressure on Warsaw directly leads to a crumbling of the Russian resistance; if Warsaw doesn't fall this year, it surely will next year, as Russia is forced to remove one of its armies after losing Sevastopol. Russia simply can't defend against both Turkey and Germany at once.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calculus" title="Calculus"><img alt="Calculus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calculus">Calculus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305658/#Comment_305658" name="Item_235" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T02:32:48+00:00" title="December 23, 2010  2:32AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 23, 2010 2:48AM by Calculus.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 1/6 is total odds for Peter to acquire a Frence SC next turn.

For example, in your current situation, StP is nigh-worthless for you: literally the only function of that fleet supported by the supply center is that it motivates me to destroy it to secure my flank. Losing StP only weakens your influence in the Nordic area while leaving your core properties intact. The very opposite is the case with Warsaw: gaining it would give Germany an incontrovertible motivation for sticking around (instead of redirecting his forces south), and the tactical position to press siege on further Russian SCs; for these reasons keeping Warsaw is crucial for Russia at the moment. Similarly Rumania is not as good a SC for Russia to fight over, as the pressures on it are greater than those on the other SCs Russia might concern itself over: by giving the place up Russia can increase the martial pressure on the Austro-Turkish border, thus redirecting his neighbours towards other opponents. Meanwhile Sev-Mos-War forms a reasonably compact triplet of centers, especially with an army in Ukraine that can operate towards all directions; the geography makes these three SCs the best three for Russia to keep if it has to retreat in the face of a western attack, just like StP-Mos-War would be the best triplet against an overbearing Turkey. The most important thing in creating a trump Power for yourself is cohesion of forces and defensible properties: the geography has to be defensible so as to maintain your existence on the board long enough to allow you an opportunity to strike back once the moment your opponent has been riding passes, as they always do whenever the other players get around to acknowledging the position. Warsaw is the gate to Russia, and as such a key property to defend with all available strength for Russia.<br/><br/>Of course all that is largely academic for me, I'm just discoursing on it to explain the strategic thinking behind the maxims I throw around here. For me it's more important that I get StP now so as to win back some of my momentum; England is a slow Power by nature, but I'd still like it if I had one more unit to throw into the fray just so I can pretend to actually have some influence on the board. Basically it's fine with me whatever you guys decide to do there on the continental plain as long as it doesn't involve a hare-brained defense of StP - keep Russia alive, dismantle between Turkey and Germany, whatever. Heck, probably even Russia will benefit in the long run from the destruction of that fleet, as it'll enable me to retrench towards new challenges that don't involve scrapping with Russia.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305674/#Comment_305674" name="Item_240" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T06:53:43+00:00" title="December 23, 2010  6:53AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, Willow, while I'm at it: you really need to get Austria behind you in this time of trials.

Except you, Daniel. Oh, well, I suppose I can get out of MAO after all if it's so important to you. I'll just spend the Christmas-time in projecting anger mixed with desperation and building fleets presumably against you, if you don't mind. (Just be ready to play along later, if you know what I mean.)<br/><br/>The German position weakened considerably in that Austrian attack, as the Kaiser can't build an unit to stop the raid immediately; he'll basically have to support himself into Munich, and even then he'll have an Austrian raider indefinitely bouncing around in the German space, unless he has time at some point to dedicate 2-3 armies to driving it out decisively. Unfortunate for Austria that the Gre-Ser defensive moves were fucked up (Serbia apparently supported Gre-Ven, which is a tad optimistic for a fleet move), resulting in an actual loss of strength for Austria now that Venice is lost as well. Austria will surely need the friendship of Italy now, so it's fortunate that the two seem to be playing like pros: Venice held and Apulia did the smart thing by bouncing Venice. Prediction: Austria's going to disband the fleet in Apulia, thus laying his disagreement with Italy to rest beautifully, preparing for the hard times ahead. The German Kaiser is unlikely to leave that Munich operation unrevenged, after all.<br/><br/>Russia played a nice southern move-set that allowed her to keep three SCs, albeit in a somewhat scattered and high-pressure position. Meanwhile Turkey takes a build from Greece; this combined with the fact that there's still a Turkish army in Armenia might mean a reneval of the Turkish Black Sea policy. It is, however, also possible for these two to surprise everybody by having Turkey disband that army on retreat and then build new units in Con and Smy, resulting in a rather tidy peace. Turkey might need this, depending on whether the Sultan interprets the recent Italo-Austrian moves the same way I do.<br/><br/>Incidentally, Willow, I'm cool with a peace agreement now. Just don't build any more northern fleets and we can be the best of friends. Ta ta.<br/><br/>Assuming that Austria disbands the Apulian fleet and Italy doesn't stab Austria immediately (my recommendation, incidentally; not smart for Italy to cause Austria to die against a strong eastern Power), those two will have a very exciting position in between Turkey and Germany, who are somewhat naturally both against Austria at the moment. Russia would be foolish to go against Austria when Warsaw is in enemy hands, so we can assume that Russia joins the other two sandwhich-fillings in between the rye loaf of Germany and the unleavened Asian stuff proffered by the Sultan from the other direction. Considering their positions, Austria will naturally dedicate two armies and a fleet against Turkey, while Italy provides the rest of the force in that direction; meanwhile Italy will probably do best to help Austria against Germany by moving to Tyrolia, providing a third army to that particular endeavour. Greece probably goes to Italy's two fleets if this joint struggle is successful, I imagine.<br/><br/>I'd write more presumptuous hypotheticals, but it's time for the Christmas Goat to visit the house. Later, perhaps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calculus" title="Calculus"><img alt="Calculus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calculus">Calculus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305855/#Comment_305855" name="Item_252" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-24T08:03:17+00:00" title="December 24, 2010  8:03AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 24, 2010 8:05AM by Calculus.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, I appreciate you saving Paris for me!

If we cannot arrange for a complete pause of some sort, then it'll be really difficult for your neighbours (and everybody else, really, by extension) to decide between exploiting your absense and hampering their own play. For example, your neighbours might actually lose position if they had to not move against you to be fair to you while the rest of the board goes on.<br/><br/>If we have to do something about the holidays, I suggest that everybody (close to Italy or not) agrees to NMR for the entire year 1904; perhaps the game program doesn't end the game or some such because of that - somebody could even make some meaningless bounces just to make sure the game still goes on. It's also possible that there is some way of pausing the game that I don't know about, of course.<br/><br/>The best solution overall would be if you could get a reserve player for Italy while you're gone, Paul. You could simply give your account info to your trusted aide, in which case there wouldn't need to be any mechanical hassle with the system, even. I could probably find somebody to play Italy here, but they'd likely have to do it in strict gunboat to ensure fairness, as anybody I'd ask to do it would naturally be a friend of mine. Of course any onlooker can volunteer here - it'd just be for a week, not an onerous obligation. I don't want any of the players in the game to take on the task, it's unfair towards the others.<br/><br/>The second-best solution is that you simply play calmly, skipping the turns you can't make, without telling anybody else in advance that you'll be NMRing and how long it's going to last. This sort of thing is part of the uncertainties of war in Diplomacy, nobody is obligated to move their units by the rules. Telling about an intent to NMR in advance is deadly in this context, as everybody around you will know about it and will act accordingly. However, a NMRing Power will often survive a year of skipped plays in some shape, as the other players will take some care in case you're just pretending to be away, and still others will take the opportunity to attack anybody seeking to take advantage of you.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>To get the idea of a consentual pause out of the way quickly one way or the other, I suggest that we vote on it immediately. If there are seven AFFIRMATIVE votes before the end of the Winter phase, then nobody makes any undeclared moves through the year 1904; if there is even one NEGATIVE, then we'll play through it and Paul'll have to make other arrangements. I'd prefer to make this completely clear and consentual so nobody can claim afterwards that they didn't realize that there was a pause in the game; we can't probably recover within the game program if somebody does something clever during the agreed-upon pause out of confusion.<br/><br/>My own vote is AFFIRMATIVE, I'm not in any particular hurry about the game. I just hope the system doesn't interpret everybody NMRing as a reason to cancel the game; perhaps we'll arrange for some specific bounces here and there on the board to pretend that the game is moving forward.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305864/#Comment_305864" name="Item_257" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-24T09:50:47+00:00" title="December 24, 2010  9:50AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I vote affirmative as well.

However, assuming that this wouldn't work, my primary tactical play would be to convoy an unit into Kiel while encouraging that Austrian army to stay put for the spring. The logic here is that there is no reasonable play that'd get the Austrian entirely out of Germany in one year, but you could achieve a cordon: if you could attack the Austrian in Munich in such a manner as to encourage a retreat to Berlin, then you could plug in the hole in Munich and force the enemy to the east. The whole idea would be to prevent the supremely annoying possibility of Mun-Kie (or Mun-Ruh; the latter is unlikely, except as a result of retreat), which would lead to the Austrian raider unit getting into reach of the western German possessions in the Low Countries and Denmark. Insofar as Austrian raiding goes, Kiel acts as a sort of watershed: force, lure or convince the raid to go to Berlin instead of Kiel or Ruhr, and you'll be able to get it out of your lands in a reasonable time-frame.<br/><br/>(If the Austrian decides to opportunistically move to Ruhr, the logic is similar, except you'll need to cordon him to the west: presumably a spring move to Belgium means a fall move to either Netherlands, from which - assuming that he succeeds in the first place - your logical approach would be to occupy Ruhr and force the raider out via the coastal Hol-Bel-Pic corridor, out to France. Basically, the key is to occupy the central German territories in Kiel and Munich to prevent the raider from making a long-term hobby of swinging east and west in turns.)<br/><br/>The strategic point in the Austrian raider situation for me would be just that - to treat the army in Munich as an isolated raider unit instead of an invasion. Germany will probably be better off by having one unit bounce Munich to prevent a reinforcement from arriving to the scene (Mun-Ruh, Boh-Mun sort of thing) while a second unit secures Kiel, rather than treat the event as a wholesale invasion where Germany would need to call back all armies everywhere for a desperate homeland defense. The latter reaction make getting rid of the raider a bit quicker, but not remarkably so, and it'd relinquish the current German interests elsewhere, leading to larger trouble in the long term. The important thing is to keep a cool head, let the Austrian mess about with his little game as he would, and make sure that the Austrian emperor knows that you're not going to be provoked and that he's basically wasting his time by allotting any force to Germany when his own eastern border is under serious danger from Turkey. The fact is that a lone raider only costs a Power one unit in lost SC count, while forcing such a raider out takes at least three units for several turns; this only makes sense when you don't have interests elsewhere to defend.<br/><br/>Which units can be spared to treat the Austrian situation is a painful question for Germany, as the choice is basically between a compromise in the western line and endangering the possession of Warsaw. My own choice in this situation would likely be to risk Warsaw, as Russia has other problems to consider, while France does not: the latter can easily take benefit from any easing up of German effort, while Russia might choose to defend the obviously vulnerable Rumanian position, in which case the army in Silesia could be spared off the Warsaw situation without causing immediate losses. This is also true tactically in that one of the more effective defenses in Warsaw is a dynamic attack on Moscow, anyway. Then there is also the consideration of the third French army in Portugal, which might well be coming up to bat this year if France manages to clear Brest or Gascony for a landing; allowing that (as opposed to continuing the siege of Paris to lock down the position) is a somewhat heavy price to pay just to bounce Munich.<br/><br/>However, overall I have to recommend a diplomatic solution: Austria has a somewhat fragile position in the east, and the possibility of an Italian NMR this year causes furthern uncertainty; Turkey meanwhile has a forward-pointing fleet set-up in the Mediterranean and a quickly shaping infantry line in the southern Balkans. The moment is not very favourable for Austria to start picking a fight with the Kaiser, which might mean that the entire affair could be laid to rest by simply offering Austria a bone in exchange for a retreat from Munich. What might be offered is trickier, as there are no immediate prizes available; perhaps the best argument is that one SC is all Austria can hope to attain against Germany even with an aggressive stance, and therefore the Austrian should hold in Munich for the year, withdraw Bohemia and allow himself to be kicked out of Munich in 1906, at which point the army might find better use elsewhere, anyway. A sort of ceasefire, that. Thinking about it I wouldn't trust this sort of solution nearly enough to not put an army into Kiel, but convincing the Austrian to retreat from Bohemia might be enough to make a bounce in Munich unnecessary for the time being.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calculus" title="Calculus"><img alt="Calculus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calculus">Calculus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306209/#Comment_306209" name="Item_274" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-29T07:49:58+00:00" title="December 29, 2010  7:49AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Remember, at this joyful point in the game, England has NO other SC's they can take, other than German ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeter, if the Baltic sea fleet moves into Kiel, Sweden is lost.

Apparently there was an automatic surrender function after all. That's fortunes of war for you, I don't think I've ever played a game of Diplomacy without some sort of orders-related mistakes coming up. In hindsight it's obvious that the system skips the winter phase altogether if nobody has builds to do, which means that our skipped year lasted only two days instead of three.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-23527-9-O.png" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-23527-9-O.png"/></a>Anyway, we have new moves, and they're pretty interesting once more - after the initial opening clash everybody's gotten a breather, and that shows in all sorts of little ways, such as rethought strategies and little mistakes in orders. Italy tried to walk a ship over the peninsula from Rome to Apulia, while the French suffered an upset loss in Paris to the Germans due to the NMR; surely a peace accord is just around the corner? Russians expectedly lose Rumania and are in danger of losing Sevastopol to the Turk as well (who called it, eh?).<br/><br/>I enjoy the Austrian aggressive stance, that's the way to play this game as a central Power. It'll be interesting to see how the Russian army in Galicia reacts to that Rumanian assault, and even more interesting to see if it's an assault at all; were I the Austrian, this move would just be a bluff and prep for a suprise Rum-Bul attack against the Turk, leaving the Russian position somewhat tenable and the Turkish position in chaos. The Italian disarmament has progressed beautifully, so there's every reason to expect that Austria has a solid ally against the Turk in the naval arena as well.<br/><br/>My own position against France was improved measurably by the French NMR, as I'll now be able to cover the entire width of the Atlantic while bringing in new armaments from the north, thus securing myself against the prospect of French raids on good ol' England. It'll take a while, but I have all the time in the world, especially as the French will probably have to make a difficult disband choice in the winter, probably between the Spanish fleet and the Portuguese army. That Italian army in Piedmont can't be a happy thing, either; Germany might just conseivably gamble with Paris to proffer a support for an attack on Marseilles, which would surely spell near disaster to France. It's actually such an aggressive move at this point that I'd reconsider as Italy - a dead France is not a long-term advantage for Italy, even if it does secure the western flank temporarily.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306281/#Comment_306281" name="Item_285" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-29T17:23:45+00:00" title="December 29, 2010  5:23PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now that I've had some time to consider the map, Peter: would you support Eng-Bre from Paris?

That puts you in position to support a convoy into Trieste, or alternativelly take Vienna and support the Naples fleet into the Ionian (you generally don't want anyone else's fleet there unless you're woefully outnumbered and need any help you can get, and then only rarely).<br/><br/>This is only so you would get some SCs of your own off the bargain. To maintain non-aggressive relations with me, all you really need to do is run a policy of non-interference as far as the Balkans go.<br/><br/>Though, I would suggest going in force against either France or Austria. Just be aware of the consequences - if France disappears off the map, it means good fortunes for England, which'll likely pick off most of it, plus bits and pieces of Germany... Might leave the west part of the map with a power vacuum you'd be in no real position to fill. You moving against Austria might mean Bill is permanentelly crippled, but you getting in position to profit from that is rather easier, at least. Might also mean that Austria has to pull out of Germany to defend against you, which can be either a good thing or a bad thing depending on what fate has in store for the German the coming year...

Dramatic as all get-out. Germany gains Moscow and Munich but loses Paris, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden and presumably Berlin, for a total of loss of two SCs. England gains two, Russia stays even, Austria loses one and Turkey gains one. Total chaos in many parts of the board, with shattered lines and enemies raiding the home SCs of mighty Powers.<br><br>As can be seen, we're renegotiating the power balance up north a bit. I'm most concerned with the prosperity of the Germany Power, of course, and therefore will be happy to relinquish the Netherlands back to the Kaiser in his time of trouble here; the Nordic area, on the other hand, is probably better held by the English, as Germany lacks the attention and means to properly police the area. Peter: I suggest that you keep a good handle on Kiel, disband the fleet and see to your defenses - I will not advance against you, and will withdraw from Belgium unless your disbands are dramatically anti-English. My follow-up plan concerns the Frenchman, who is also a problem for you, and thus I am the least of your problems at the moment. The current borders (excepting Belgium, which I'll give back) are easily defensible and natural for both of us, and do not necessitate an excessive border patrol from either of us.<br><br>Willow: I'm cool with you in StP for the time being, as you don't have a fleet presence there. I suggest that you use the position to win back your core possessions, and perhaps consider demilitarizing our border areas like I've done. I will consider swinging up and coming back to StP, but if you act quickly in calming the area down, that might not be necessary at all.<br/><br/>Italy and Austria will have a fun time dealing with the Turk now, I can see that. The Bulgarian position is rather untenable, while the Austrian home SCs are almost bare to raid and conquest. Unless a concord can be made with Russia and Italy continues coordinating extremely closely, I doubt that Austria will last long in this situation. The situation's not extremely bad from an Italian viewpoint, as now Austria will definitely be a reliable ally who'll be more than happy to help him into Greece next year. The only question is whether they actually can overcome the Turk, even together. The Turkish defensive position with two fleets is, as always, extremely solid.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306353/#Comment_306353" name="Item_297" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-30T08:05:34+00:00" title="December 30, 2010  8:05AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What an entirely unexpected stab of the German!

A tidy peace with France would be an option by getting rid of the two German armies in France, but I sort of doubt that France would let the matter lie if Germany removed the specific force that's keeping him from ravaging Germany.<br/><br/>On the other hand, removing the eastern force is quite thinkable for Germany, it seems to me: it's true that a loss of Moscow and Warsaw would be imminent, and that would cause further cascading weakness in the west, but that'd happen a year later - perhaps enough time to get the situation in the homeland under control. Russia would have no particular motivation to go after Germany after regaining War and Mos, too, so it's a politically much more stable solution than removing the western flank.<br/><br/>The best solution might well be to remove F Bal (which, as I discussed earlier, has no useful function next year) and A Mos, then move A War-Sil in the spring to use that particular army against the Austrian infestation in Berlin. The armies from Warsaw, Kiel and Munich will be able to recapture Berlin without much fuzz while also taking Belgium, which'll compensate for the loss of Moscow and Warsaw to Russia, stabilizing the German realm. The Kaiser could even try for a treaty of controlled retreat with Russia, something where the Russian promises to only take Moscow next year and Warsaw only the year after, giving Germany a valuable extra year of operational time for one of those armies. Little reason for Russia to abide by such a treaty, of course, except for strategic (a wish to see Germany get his house in order) and diplomatic (proof of willingness to work together in the future) reasons, which might or might not sway Willow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306370">\n<div

Up to now, you, me and Austria have been doing our little thing in our side of the board, but from now on, everything each of us does changes the situation for the whole board, and thus, the whole game, and thus, the *endgame*, and thus, who wins this game!<br/><br/>Why? Because England just went up to 7 SCs. Normally, that wouldn't be such a big deal, as that's an advantage that can easily be countered by an alliance of two or so other powers... But in this case, that simply can't happen - Russia has no northern fleet and has years before she can possibly get one up. Germany will soon be forced to defend all of its coastal home SCs, which again will mean that he will be forced to place his armies onto Kiel and Berlin, meaning that no new German fleets shall be forthcoming either. France is the only western country with anything even close to a naval force, but Eero has enough strength in numbers to keep France in that little corner indefinitelly and jab at her while he does.<br/><br/>Because of Eero's better strategic position, he'll have a number of 'superflous' units he can throw away on any attacks he wishes - win some, lose some, he now has enough of a buffer to be able to get back up from many small defeats - not that any of those are very likely to begin with. Slowly but surely, he'll take control of the majority of the western coastal SCs, and then will start making his way deeper inland.<br/><br/>The endgame depends very much on what he'll find there then - a bunch of squabbling nations, easy to pick off one by one, or two or so countries with most of their teritorial disputes long decided, and ready to face any western threat.<br/><br/>Simply put, of the three of us - Italy, Turkey, and Austria, one has to go for the other two to grow in power and become relevant enough for the endgame.<br/><br/>You're off the table because neither Austria nor I am in good position to grab up your holdings, nor we will likely be soon, with our forces tangled at our mutual border.<br/>Turkey's on the table, but my position is defensible enough that it will take a long time for anything to crack my shell, time during which Eero will remain relativelly unopposed.<br/>Austria, however, is teethering on the edge already, and the only question is if we should give a push.<br/><br/>And yes, we should. The builds we would gain from the venture would allow us to move against Russia and Germany, respectivelly, while maintaining enough of a force to make attacking each other too costly to consider. At that point, we can shore up Moscow and Munich, effectivelly eliminating Eero's chance for a solo and going for a three or four-way draw.<br/><br/><br/>Whatever you do decide, I strongly suggest you lay off France. As long as France's fleets exist, England is barred from entering the Mediterranean, and will be forced to move over land, something she is not naturally well-equipped to do. Move against Austria, attack Turkey if you must (futile though it would be), but do leave France alone and consider demilitarizing borders with her - her units are better spent elsewhere.<br/><br/><br/>Oh, and yes. Bill, the above probably applies to you too, but our current troop placement would make a joint attack on Italy somewhat of a pipe dream... Still, if you could see your way to support Eastern Med into the Ionian, I'd suddenly get a whole bunch of things I could do that aren't attacking you, and would thus cease hostilities against you immediatelly in thanks.

My attempt to relieve some of the pressure on Russia by tackling Germany was intended to give her a chance to reclaim Warsaw, but Willow saw other opportunities and took them--at my expense, certainly, but I don't blame her for that. And it was clearly foolish to expect any kind of aggressiveness from Italy without prior arrangement, but saying "Hey, Paul, can you attack the Aegean Sea?" would have been tantamount to putting out a welcome mat on the Ionian Sea (although upon reflection that might have been better for me short term).<br/><br/>So I made some erroneous judgments and tactical blunders, and now I'm on the ropes. Daumantas, I would have liked to have given you more of a challenge, but your superior tactical play has got me flummoxed. I am worried that you will soon grow bored with toying with me, and move quickly now to administer the coup de grace.<br/><br/>Still, all is not lost! I imagine that everyone else besides Eero and Daumantas are feeling a little hard-pressed right now, so maybe we can work together to salvage something. <br/><br/>Peter, I am suing for peace. I will evacuate Berlin; you may reclaim it at your leisure. I hope that we can work together to contain the Turkish threat, and that you can reach a similar accommodation with Daniel to deal with England, and with Willow to regularize your lines.<br/><br/>Willow, I need you order Vie-Tri, Ukr S Bul-Rum in the spring, so that I can support you into Serbia in the fall. I realize that this leaves Sevastopol vulnerable, but if you can work with Peter to do something to protect it--perhaps you can trade Sev for Mos, or perhaps he will agree to support Ukr-Sev in the fall. If nothing else, agreeing to this plan will make Daumantas more likely to build a fleet, which given your current disposition of forces you can only find preferable.<br/><br/>Paul, I hope I can count on you to help me out in the Mediterranean and the Balkans. For this turn, if you move Rom-Apu, Pie-Ven, TyS S Ion, Ion S Alb-Gre, the chance of a Turkish breakout into the Med is minimized. I don't expect to actually take Greece, but the threat should be enough to keep the pressure on so that when Russian troops occupy Serbia, they'll be able to support you into Greece.<br/><br/>That's the best I've got; if it's a pipe dream, I'll still go down fighting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306462/#Comment_306462" name="Item_306" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-31T09:16:43+00:00" title="December 31, 2010  9:16AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 31, 2010 9:17AM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The corner Powers have somewhat of an advantage in the open diplomacy environment, as their diplomacy is, generally speaking, more about propaganda and less about coordinated moves.

This should prevent an English break-through to the Mediterranean, limiting the English influence strictly to the Atlantic arena. Aside from that I fail to see how anything you might do would be remotely relevant to the English situation, what with you being clearly dominant on the continent while England is utterly unwilling to engage anybody in that direction (which can be seen in the builds; a continentally focused England would have built an army, if not two).<br/><br/>Meanwhile, that power vacuum in Russia is mighty interesting now that it's on the map as a fact. Considering that Russia only has three units available, it'll be interesting to see how Willow'll manage to cover Moscow, Warsaw and the imminent threat to Sevastopol with those. Might not be a bad idea to simply leave taking Moscow back for later; in my eyes it seems utterly obvious that the Turk'll be advantaged greatly by grabbing for Sevastopol and thus securing the northern flank as part of his current expansionist attitude. After all, the alternative is to see Russia gain a build next winter, possibly with Sevastopol open - that could open the Black Sea issue all over again. I could see room for a Turko-Russian alliance, too, but those two might be too proud and prickly for that, considering the past.<br/><br/>Daniel: if you'll move away from the Atlantic Ocean altogether this turn, I'll be content with demilitarizing MAO instead of occupying it; we could even make it a perennial bounce if you have nothing better to do with your fleets. I'm sure that you'll see how it's one and the same for me, but probably wastly preferable for you to not have me sit in there, threatening half your SCs all at once. You may, of course, simply move your Atlantic fleet to Portugal at this point, which suffices for my security without being any sort of tactical loss for you, as that's where you'd be going anyway in the fall. Note that next turn'll be too late for this arrangement, as I'll already have the conquest of MAO under way then.<br/><br/>Paul: I think that you should make very certain that Austria does not fall and Turkey does not break through to the Ionian Sea; these are major priorities for Italian security. I'm affirming this evaluation again because it seems to me that you're being unnecessarily conservative about your army distribution; that army in Piedmont is unlikely to make a breakthrough to Marseilles alone, and you can't afford to send one of your fleets to help it as long as the Turk threatens the Ionian with two fleets and the Austrian fleet is in the reach of Turkish armies. Meanwhile there's a certain lack of military strength in the Balkans. It'd probably be a good idea if you moved your armies towards the front-lines with haste, moving through Austrian territories if necessary. It's more important to plug the line in an immediate sense than to respect traditional borders when the safety of the European heartlands is at stake. (Were I you I'd prepare the southern army for a convoy over the Ionian while the northern one moves through Venice to block the imminent Turkish occupation of Trieste, but that's arguable; the situation is complex and near desperate unless Russia gets its ass in gear soon.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306528/#Comment_306528" name="Item_312" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-01T09:30:36+00:00" title="January  1, 2011  9:30AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 1, 2011 9:35AM by DWeird.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill, I doubt very much that Austria's current state is a matter of a lack of skill at your part.

I'm not suddenly going to snap my fingers and win this game just because I attacked Germany and incidentally saved your ass from imminent destruction. Now you're directly threatening me with new fleet builds up in StP when I've been most clear in my intent to let you clear your house in peace, even going so far as to grant you back one of your home SCs to give you a base to work from. That's gratitude for you, apparently the next time a central Power is sweeping the board I should just let them.<br/><br/>Considering my willingness to work with you and the clear consensus the other western Powers have about allying against me, it seems pretty obvious that it's Turkey you should be arraigning against, not me. Apparently it escaped everybody else's attention aside from me and Bill, but Daumantas actually has a very strong tactical position here: he's beating both Austria and Italy all alone even as it is, as anybody can affirm for their own satisfaction by simply considering the current unit set-up. I do not understand why eastern Powers should treat the entirely common disagreements of the western triangle here as somehow more important than their own situation, when I am clearly unable to attack my western neighbours, even as the Sultan is setting up to break through into the Austrian heartlands and the Italian seas both. Of course it's not a done deal (solo victory OMG), but it's certainly of more concern to Russia than whatever happens between the western Powers.<br/><br/>Supposing I have any say in it, this apocalyptic tone of discussion would be better set aside. Solo victories and Grand Alliances are being flung about when the game has just barely entered its middle phase. All Powers are still on the board and there's not even any clearly superior contender evident for a solo victory. Everybody's writing like I'm suddenly it, but as I noted above, Daumantas is doing even better than I am, what with his actual ability to project force against opponents in disarray, while I'm faced with the single most coherent and least threatened Power on the board in France, all set up to kill me as best he can. I must be missing something tactical here, as I simply don't see why I'm suddenly such a great danger to everybody when I can't even keep hold of what little I currently possess.<br/><br/>It seems to me that Daniel's not biting on my offer of peace, but this is likely not going to be much of an issue for everybody else; mostly it just means that I'll be seizing MAO by force, after which the French forces fortify the Iberian peninsula and we'll spend a few years sitting tight while Daniel thinks about whether fighting with me is really going to accomplish anything for him. Anybody can certify for themselves as a tactical exercise what it would take for me to make any progress whatsoever against France at this juncture; perhaps considering the tactical situation against the forces I actually have at my disposal will calm any wild visions of great conquest - or maybe I'm myself just not seeing that excellent set of moves that allows me to make any progress against France.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306559/#Comment_306559" name="Item_316" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-01T21:36:08+00:00" title="January  1, 2011  9:36PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul -- FYI: I may order Alb S Ion-Gre. -- Bill                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306569/#Comment_306569" name="Item_317" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-02T01:53:41+00:00" title="January  2, 2011  1:53AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniel, Paul,<br/><br/>Regarding the Ionian - while I don't want to throw a wrench into the workings of a credible keep-Eero-out-of-the-Med plan, and recognize the importance of the Ionian to Italian home defense...<br/><br/>That place isn't only a part of a defensive line for Italy, but a prime locationg for staging an attack on Turkey.<br/><br/>Would it be enough if I promised to attack with only a single fleet, without support? In that case, Italy would only lose the Ionian if her fleet attacks me, and would, of course, be unable to succesfully support an austrian unit either.<br/><br/>Alternativelly, since Paul is known for keeping his promises, I would not make a single move towards the Ionian provided that Paul promises me the Ionian fleet makes no aggressive moves against me.<br/><br/>That doesn't leave the fleet with much to do, I know... But A Pied-Tyr, A Rome-Ven, A Ion-Adr is certainly an option. That's enough troops to take up Trieste and Vienna and keep them both.<br/><br/>That leaves the Ionian open, of course...

There is also no reprieve in sight - A Russian fleet build would perhaps destabilize the situation, but that's years away and would benefit Russia in no way whatsoever, as we'll see when I pick apart the whole-board dynamics below. I would therefore like to argue that one or both of you guys needs to start making some real efforts at peace overtures here: the only alternative is a complete deadlock until and unless the Russian Power decides for some unfathomable reason to dedicate half of her forces first to clearing StP for builds, and then to building up a significant fleet force. I do not have, and never have had, the sort of force composition that would allow me to hold and keep continental SCs such as the German Netherlandic possessions or the Baltic coast; you two are absurdly far from the sort of naval force that could hope to conquer Denmark, not to speak of more distant English colonies, as I am fully capable of blockading your building ports even if you did get some magic SCs out of nowhere for enabling those builds.<br/><br/>Now, having the situation in complete standstill is not threatening in itself for me, say, but it does have drastic long-term implications. Assuming that we three decide to resolve the western triangle by basically sitting still for the next five years (that is, not resolving anything), the only possible outcome will surely be that the <i>eastern</i> triangle resolves itself somehow sooner or later, perhaps with a dominant Turkey or perhaps something else. At that point we will be utterly unable to compose a draw-capable defense due to the undeveloped state of our own forces and the stagnant lines we'd have developed until that point. In this way the choice of simply sitting tight will ultimately lead at best to an uncertain, difficult alliance against a dominant eastern Power, and at worst with a solo victory for the same.<br/><br/>Considering the above, I find the current outspoken German policy of curtailing England foolish; it would be much better to recognize the tactical reality and consider the past events a fait accompli, mere facts to build upon for future play. Like it or not, the nature of the game is such that one of the three western Powers has to be eliminated for the other two to have a credible chance of victory (drawn or otherwise); like it or not, England is currently tactically untouchable even by a whole-board Grand Alliance (for which there is no motivation whatsoever on the parts of the eastern Powers), so we already know that <i>I</i> won't be that first western Power to be eliminated. Either we get rid of Germany or France, or we sit here until some eastern Power wins the game.<br/><br/>Looking at the current German policy of maintaining a hostile fleet and warmongering among the neighbouring nations, I'm pretty willing to switch my heretofore most rewarding German allegiance any which way as soon as there is some continental movement of forces and one of you guys takes the initiative in fucking up that pesky third wheel. Because I want the stalemate resolved, I will obviously encourage this development sooner rather than later by electing to make relatively neutral and defensive moves myself from now on; no need to feel like you need to sit around and worry about me, do make your moves whenever you're ready. I'll be happy to support any proactive moves you'd care to declare, of course, but perhaps a complete surprise attack is the better way; your call, and I'll back the one who gets the upper hand first.<br/><br/>(In case you need outspoken plans, I'll provide suggested deals for both sides: if we're going to kill Germany, I'd like to claim both Netherlands with fleets while France can have the rest, with me staying out of the Baltic Sea to ensure demarcation - France helps me disband a couple of fleets in the long term, of course, so I can switch to a northern army assault. If we're still after France, I'll have the Iberian peninsula while the Kaiser can keep the rest. Obviously I'll be glad to move in a quite conservative and secure manner to ensure that my ally doesn't need to worry about any independent thought on the part of the English admiralty, which is admittedly well-known for its adventurous initiatives. In both of these cases I'd like to request that my ally signs up for a plan of naval control: I can live with a France in perpetual stalemate at MAO with free French fleet build-up on the Mediterranean, of course, but a German ally needs to remain at the current fleet build-up, and keep the fleet in coastal Germany, out of the Baltic waters and the Nordic sphere; I trust that neither of those requests is too onerous, all things considered.)<br/><br/>If there is some other way the western situation can go, I'd love to hear the concrete schematic. I can sort of visualize some harebrained scheme where the French and German forces help each other disband so you two can build more fleets, but hey, be realistic - any French fleet build-up in Marseilles is already completely irrelevant to my defensive needs (due to the MAO bottleneck, work it out), and Germany will be quite hard-pressed to clear a SC on the Baltic coast for builds the way things are going. England is quite difficult to kill at the best of times, and it's completely fantastic now, so at this point I feel that I deserve that you at least admit that I've fought myself into a position where the ball is firmly in your court: one of you two has to go. (Another hare-brained scheme that occurs to me is that you might conquer some more SCs off the eastern half of the board to get more fleets. Good luck with that, according to my calculations you might be able to detach one whole army for the venture in 1908, once our lines completely stabilize.)<br/><br/>I will, of course, be more than glad to discuss any specific tactical scenarios if either of you has doubts about my claimed invulnerability or the chances that I might be able to take and hold continental SCs against your current total of seven armies with my three-ish fleets dedicated to coastal skirmish.

Everyone's seen how this has played out - Germany lost three supply centers. France lost Brest.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href="/forums/profile/Eero">@Eero</a>, next year with the SC loss you'll have to start working hard just to keep your current gains. You want France dead because that would give you a solo victory. It was a risky move you made last winter build, giving up on certain gain to try for the big prize. But that's passed. Now, every season you spend gaining position on France, (but not SC's!), Turkey, Germany, and Russia get stronger. I didn't expect you to build to attack MOA last winter, simply because it wasn't in your best intrest. Your best interest (outside of finishing off a stabed Germany), and what I expected you to do, is St Petersburg. Were you to fight that direction, both Germany and France have alternative profitable courses of action that don't involve fighting England. But if you are attacking us, we'll be fighting you. My trust for you is zero, so if you want to end the MOA fight, you have to be the one to make the first move. I'd be delighted to demilitarize it IF there were no English fleets able to reach it before I could.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href="/forums/profile/Peter">@Peter</a>, I'm glad to see your progress retaking your turf. I'd appreciate if Burgandy moved to Belgium this fall. It's a PITA for me to have Paris and Marseilles constantly threatened. I could have retaken or can retake it in the future, but I'd much rather leave it open (which can only happen if you move.) Open lets us both use armies elsewhere. Either of us there, means that the other has two have armies pointed back to prevent stabs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href="/forums/profile/Willow">@Willow</a>, just because I think that England "should" attack you, doesn't mean I think they "will". Currenly our interests are quite aligned. Next year an army in Finland could hand you Norway.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href="/forums/profile/Damultus">@Damultus</a> (and Paul), if Paul returns, and posts his intention to help me at least an hour before the time limit, the deal will still be on. Otherwise, the deal's off, and you can act as you see best. My preference still would be that you would not attack Italy, but I would't self-immolate over it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul">@Paul</a>, from Piedmont, get thee hence!

As I see it, that arranged bounce kept Marseilles safe from Germany while simultaneously allowing you to keep that fleet in position to support the MAO. So, I thought I was helping you--and I'm not sure why that's not the case, but that may be my inexperience talking. Was there a better way to help you against Germany? I believe Eero when he says that France's downfall is not in Italy's interests--that seems like solid sense to me.<br><br>I'm willing to support you from the Western Med, also, as you suggested, so long as Daumantas agrees not to attack the Ionian. Are you OK with that, Daumantas?<br><br>Bill, how are things looking from your end? That Turkish army in Trieste is almost certainly not making you happy. I suppose we could arrange to bounce him up Northwards or force him to disband, and I don't think Daumantas has too much reason to object to that. Do you, Daumantas? Speak up if you have a different idea.<br><br>As for Eero's situation, I for one believe his claims of invulnerability.

Russian intervention would be a spoiler, which Eero knows, which is why he's so eager to prevent it.<br/><br/>Loss of Marseilles, either to the German or the Italian, might actually be in France's best interests this turn- it allows the disbandment of an army, which then opens the door for a possibility of another fleet build when its recaptured, plus it props up an ally on another front- but it's a risky gambit, because it requires a way to safely leave Brest open- a bounce is the best choice, but France won't have the units to self-bounce and retake Marseilles all in one year.  France should probably insist on Bel-Hol, Ruh S Bel-Hol, Bur-Bel if he doesn't pursue this strategy at all, or if he chooses to favor the Italian, who could benefit from a fleet build.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306719/#Comment_306719" name="Item_330" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-03T21:53:07+00:00" title="January  3, 2011  9:53PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Bill.<br/><br/>Daniel, what do you think of Willow's analysis there?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306735/#Comment_306735" name="Item_331" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-04T00:59:05+00:00" title="January  4, 2011 12:59AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll reiterate: the only SCs that are "in play" here in the west are the continental SCs, such as Holland, where I have not pretended for a minute that I would be able to hold the place. Quite probably I will be haunted out of there this year. This does not change the fact that SCs such as all English home centers, Denmark, Sweden... those are not in the reach of the Franco-German alliance. Tough on you, no doubt, but incontrovertible as a tactical fact, too. Holland does not make or break anything here, it's the bare minimum Germany needs to take to not be forced to remove an unit (not that such a disband would matter much; it'd likely be a Bur at this point, I imagine).<br/><br/>I am not concerned about Russia in this position simply because Willow has strong interests in not interfering in a western stalemate: Turkey is a current, clear threat to Russia as an eastern Power, and any hypothetical gains Russia might make against me would be hotly contested; the very best outcome Russia might hope for would be for me to break off my current engagements against Germany, say, to turn my attentions towards her, resulting in years of warfare and (quite likely) a second loss of StP; the geography just dictates this when Russia is entirely vulnerable to complementary attacks on her southern flank while I'm relatively free to do whatever I want here in the Northern Atlantic. The net result for Russia would be to increase her vulnerability both north and south by making it impossible for herself to commit a credible force in the eastern triangle relations around Rumania, all merely to help the western Powers break out of our paralyzed situation - no sense whatsoever from a Russian viewpoint, when what Russia wants should be for us to be as ineffective as possible here while she strives to become supreme against her more immediate neighbours. Russia <i>wants</i> us to stay in just the positions we are in, no need to rock the boat insofar as she's concerned.<br/><br/>To clarify, I don't particularly expect any drastic shifts in the Franco-German politics for the next couple of turns; Diplomacy has its inertia, and I'm sure it'll take some time for you guys to be convinced about the ugly tactical reality here. I'll do my best to work towards as static position as possible to sufficiently demonstrate the futility of the current war, and you by all means choose your moment for realigning your efforts, whenever you're comfortable. Right now it doesn't seem that the eastern Powers are that interested in reaching west, either, so we're unlikely to be interrupted for a couple of turns, however you want to play this. (Russia might theoretically make temporary peace with Turkey, at which point a small expedition to eastern Germany would be an option. Not Russia's best move in my mind, though.)<br/><br/>(And of course, if you have any suggestions as to what I could do to get us out of the current static diplomatic positions, I'm all ears. I make note of Daniel's wish that I'd demilitarize NAO-Iri-Eng in exchange for peace with France, and while I don't see this as realistic or even necessary, it's good to know what you're thinking in that regard.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306739/#Comment_306739" name="Item_332" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-04T01:49:54+00:00" title="January  4, 2011  1:49AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul,<br/><br/>I do indeed have a <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=306384" rel="nofollow">different idea</a>.<br/><br/>I'm currently at war with Austria and am doing well enough so that I wouldn't stop unless someone makes me.

You can now either help perpetuate the stalemate until either Russia, or, less likely, Austria breaks through and you're left with very little for all of your good deeds... Or we can split her straight down the middle. Trieste and Vienna are natural holdings for Italy, and I'm not too interested in anything beyond Serbia... Leaving Budapest an SC who's ownership should depend on the tactical situation, and which we could eventually trade back and forth depending on how the situation plays out.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not trying to add pressure here, but if you refuse, I'll be forced to move a fleet into the Ionian. Simply put, the inevitable Russian build puts me on the defensive, stretching my forces thin and making me take risks, and thus making SC loss probable... Meaning I'll need *some* avenue of growth that's more likely than the now crowded Austrian front simply to be able to reliably keep my current forces working.<br/><br/>Yes, I am still interested in keeping Eero contained. But I can only help you do so from a position of relative strength - which fighting on three fronts isn't. Help me out here, okay?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calculus" title="Calculus"><img alt="Calculus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calculus">Calculus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306776/#Comment_306776" name="Item_337" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-04T08:28:23+00:00" title="January  4, 2011  8:28AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 4, 2011 8:31AM by Calculus.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "If the supporting unit is attacked during the turn by some other unit, its support is cut.

I'm still on the ropes. I wish I had thought it remotely plausible that Peter was going to leave Berlin alone, otherwise I'd have attacked from Budapest to open it up for a build. That would have improved my position immeasurably, even if only with a unit borrowed for another year. You see what use I was able to make of the one from this year! Of course, Paul's attack Ion-Gre was instrumental; even more critical was the move into Tyrolia to cut off your army's line of retreat into the Austrian hinterlands. <br/><br/>Paul, Daumantas's offer only makes sense in a short term context. Clearly, you're now in a position to make short work of Austria, and even though I know you're not the sort of guy who would kick a man when he's down, let me lay out the case for staying the course. Turkey's positional advantage and Mediterranean aspirations will always be a threat to Italy; once Austria is dead, Turkey's fleet-heavy force composition make Italy the logical next target. Now, you might convince Russia to help you fight Turkey, but at that point the war in the West will be that much closer to completion, and you'll have to be fighting both east and west. But if we can convince Willow to throw some support down south right now, we might be able to beat Turkey back soon enough to face the victor of the Western Triangle together.<br/><br/>Willow, Daumantas fought you to a standstill last time, but now thanks to some fortuitous circumstances (to which I like to think that I contributed) and your own intestinal fortitude, you're back on your feet. I think Paul is on my side against Turkey, and it's pretty clear that Daumantas isn't about to offer me any kind of alliance anytime soon.

It's just that the only build Willows can do is threatening my exposed backside, and I'd be forced to to take some sort of defensive measures just to keep on the safe side. I'd ask her to abstain from a build altogether, but that would be simply unwise at her part, really - while I'm not at all interested in moving there in force, I would certainly take an opportunity to retreat there if given one... And it now seems increasingly likely that I will get it.<br/><br/>Paul,<br/><br/>I'm certainly an interested party here, so be sure to use your own judgement on this. That said, I think these are the facts and the options you're facing:<br/><br/>First,<br/><br/>You are getting your builds either from France, from Turkey, or from Austria.<br/><br/>France is currently no good due to her role in the western balance.<br/><br/>I am a credible target if you want to rebalance the eastern part of the board. However, it would be a tough job for Italy to actually make any gains on Turkey, what with the Greece-Aegan-Eastern Med defensive line. If anyone is going to make gains, it's Russia (and if Russia isn't taking part in the attack at all, *no one* is making gains, period), or perhaps Austria. So yes, I can be 'contained', but it will be a difficult job, and you won't gain any benefit from it aside from a stronger Austria or Russia, which isn't exactly an advantage.<br/><br/>Austria is a good target because it is a relativelly easy one. Together, we could crack her in two years or so, making the eastern board dynamics simpler and allowing the involved parties to move on to something on the other side of the board. The trick for you here is to manage the partitioning of Austria in such a way that would allow you to receive more or faster gains and me lesser or slower gains. I doubt you would get a better position for this than your current one.<br/><br/>Second,<br/><br/>Bill is right. Sooner or later, Turkish fleets are going to attack italian waters. The only question is when - right now, or when you have enough builds to get a credible defense?<br/><br/>Currently, Italy has a certain diplomatical defense from Turkey granted to it by Italy's part in the western balance. However, if the situation is such that Italy's threat is greater to my continued existance than Italy's usefulness elsewhere (what good is a contained England to me if I'm in no position to take advantage of it?), that is very much void.<br/><br/>Knocking out the Ionian Fleet the next year is easily accomplished, it offers me both a remarkably less complicated defense and various avenues for growth, and there is no reason not to do it if Italy plans to continue her attack against me.<br/><br/>However, if Italy deems continued Turkish hostilities unnecessary and helps with the Austrian offense, the relative advantage of staying out of Italian waters becomes much greater than in them - the actual threat of Italy is temporarily removed, I get to make gains against Austria, and the western situation remains more or less stable.<br/><br/>At that point, you would be strong enough to hold your own in the Med and we'd either tossle over the Balkans or move to strike other countries separetelly, depending what the general state of the board is.<br/><br/>Not that very good a deal either way, but playing Italy pretty much forces you to make the best of a bad job. I wouldn't fault you whichever way you choose... But now you know what the consequences of your choice would be.<br/><br/><br/>Speaking of the general state of the board, by the way - as long as your fleet helps the french hold the line for a year or two, we'd likely be looking at something very different by the time Austria is gone. At least one of the western nations is bound to build at least one more fleet, which'll draw some of Eero's forces to it and make keeping coastal SCs more difficult, which will in turn decrease the pressure on the French fleets, which in turn... There's also the issue of the Russian armies - its doubtful that they'll see action soon, but they are currently free to position against just about anyone in range. So, the future shall be full of surprises!

That unit serves no practical purpose whatsoever except a threatened attack on Sweden and Denmark, the people of which voiced clear preference for immediate annexation into the Commonwealth of Nations this last year - no reason whatsoever for you to continue in an aggressive stance, and plenty of benefit for us both in scaling back the current hostilities. I don't even have any particular requirements regarding your French relations or whatever, I'm sure you'll draw your own conclusions on where to seek your lebensraum. A central Power like yours will be unlikely to win the game with a sit-and-wait attitude, and you're not gaining anything by aggravating me, so it seems to me to only make sense to listen to the voice of reason on this. You could easily free up 2-3 armies for an actually effective offensive somewhere else by taking my peace; A Bel and A Kie (bouncing in Holland) are sufficient against trivial stabs from Denmark or the North Sea in perpetuity, if that's the sort of thing that worries you.<br/><br/>Paul: I know that it's useful for you if the Turk really desists from attacking you navally due to your perceived support for the French defensive efforts, but I think you should know what Daumantas probably does: France does not need your help in reality, as I do not have a sufficient force for actually seizing any French possessions or extending my influence into Italian territory - our current war is a mummery with little meaning, and there is no strategic advantage for me in pushing fleets to the Mediterranean without credible targets and the constant danger of a French breakthrough to the Atlantic. Therefore my current stance is one of static defense, and while I would prefer to perform this defense on the Mid-Atlantic due to security reasons, the position in itself would be of no offensive advantage whatsoever against a France capable of occupying both Portugal and Spain with fleets. I don't mind you supporting Daniel at MAO, of course, but do be careful of Daumantas; I don't believe he's as interested in this purported anti-English coalition as he claims. At least, were I playing Turkey here, I would definitely pay lip service to the convenient French scheme to get the jump on Italy.<br/><br/>Again, I'd be pleased to pick apart any tactical concerns in detail if any one of you actually has irrational fears regarding the potency of the English in doing anything proactive whatsoever anywhere on the board. Personally I do not see a single supply center on the board that the English are capable of seizing in 1907 from others, so this whole idea of blockading England from an imminent victory seems extremely far-fetched.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306864/#Comment_306864" name="Item_344" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-05T01:26:38+00:00" title="January  5, 2011  1:26AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Willow,<br/><br/>Perhaps I could convince you to not build there after all, then?<br/><br/>It doesn't seem like you would need that army for any offensive manouvers. Defensive ones are also unnecessary (minus the obvious turkish fleet issue, more on which later), or at least wouldn't be helped by a build in Sev. Meaning, you are essentially free to put that build to use a year later in one of your more westward centers without much threat.<br/><br/>Now, as for defense against me... In the short term, an army in Sev does provide some measure of protection, but it might bog us both down in the long. As long as you build a unit in Sev, I will very like build one in Ankara and then order it to Armenia just in case. You would then either order your army to Armenia and we'd have a bounce (increasing tension on both our sides), or you would get both Armenia and Rumania to border you. In which case, you would probably (quite reasonably) react to this as an attack, and commit one of your other armies to Sev's defense.<br/><br/>In short, our border would get crowded again and we'd both be back to growling at each other angrily while commiting units to a frontline which won't budge in either direction.<br/><br/>If you promise to make no build in Sev, though, I'd be able to make one in Const, bolstering up my Austrian lines with no mounting threat to you.<br/><br/>And, since not having to commit two units to defense is immensely more useful to me than gaining a single build, if you would not make a build in Sev, I would make an unconditional promise (that is, no matter what the situation on my other fronts is, no matter how hurting for a build I am, and etc) to not attack Sev or otherwise try to claim it for at least a year, renewable next year, if you want it, on similar terms - no builds or armies in Sev.<br/><br/>There is a slight risk on my side - if you build something in Sev and I in Const, I might be unable to stop the Sev unit's run into Armenia and beyond... But, while that would certainly cost me momentum, I would probably be able to defend against that at a not too large cost, so I'm willing to take this as long as I get your word for it.<br/><br/>Sound okay?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306865/#Comment_306865" name="Item_345" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-05T01:51:36+00:00" title="January  5, 2011  1:51AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>You're right - I'm no longer worried about a solo victory on the part of the English, but that is precisely because of what you are currently trying to unmake - an alliance and coordinated defense efforts between Germany and France (and possibly Russia?). The situation is still such that, were those defense efforts to crumble and either of the continental powers turned on the other, you would be in position to make relativelly more gains than either of the two sides, and even more if you don't see it necessary to lay off of whoever your notional ally would then be...<br/><br/>As long as you're free from counterattack, you're not nearly as diplomatically bound as the rest of us, freeing up your hands for all sorts of shennanigans as soon as there's an opening. Turkey will immediatelly forget about the whole english issue as soon as there is a credible european fleet in the water, but as for now, a little restraint now and then to allow others to keep you neatly bottled is certainly not out of the question for Turkey.<br/><br/>And, while France would certainly be able to defend against the english right now, she would not be able to stop an english fleet from entering the Med - which would be not that important right now, but would be a very important wildcard later in the game. And hell, Iberia surrounded by the English? Sooner or later the French will slip, and England gets her inpermeable defense all over the western waters. I like all of my western powers evenly matched, thank you very much!<br/><br/><br/>That said - yes, there are issues that Turkey is more interested in, namely either reducing the total number of fronts she has to fight on or, failing that, achieving a more defensible position.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calculus" title="Calculus"><img alt="Calculus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calculus">Calculus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306888/#Comment_306888" name="Item_346" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-05T07:49:09+00:00" title="January  5, 2011  7:49AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="view_image.php?game_id=23527&amp;gdate=11&amp;current_phase=B" class="bbcode_img" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/view_image.php?game_id=23527&amp;gdate=11&amp;current_phase=B"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306890/#Comment_306890" name="Item_347" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-05T07:56:58+00:00" title="January  5, 2011  7:56AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daumantas-<br/><br/>I'm quite surprised you disbanded your army afield- I would have thought an additional unit in the Balkans would be vital.<br/><br/>I have scrabbled hard to get back up to four centers- giving up my build is completely out of the question.

And since there's not much for you to do there aside from either gunning for turkish home SCs, which probably isn't going to work, or going for Rumania, I'm assuming that that's what you're going to try and take.<br/><br/>If that's the case - be my guest, I certainly can't stop you. In fact, I certainly wouldn't be against just letting you in there - the fleet doesn't do much for me there, and a Russian army would be just dandy.<br/><br/>Of course, that leaves me short of a build, so I'd only like to ask that we coordinate an attack on Budapest/Serbia as well. You get two builds, I... well, I manage to stay afloat in the game.

The problem I see with Italy is that you cant make gains very easily because you are so stuck in the middle but on the outside.  Your best bet is to be fairly passive and supportive of your neighbors.  Be friends with everyone and look to take advantage once things start to fall apart.  You dont want to initiate war with anyone you want to help others finish someone off and take small gains that keep you secure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307167/#Comment_307167" name="Item_358" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-06T16:37:33+00:00" title="January  6, 2011  4:37PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 6, 2011 4:38PM by Bill_White.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul -- Here's my honest read on your situation. Right now you are no one's primary target: France is oriented northward, toward England, as is Germany; Austria is increasingly more rapidly being smothered by Turkey, who is content to focus on one foe at a time. England has her shields up, and Russia its eying up its near abroad for targets. That will change as things elsewhere on the board get resolved, and so you want to position yourself to (a) get builds and (b) influence the resolution of conflicts elsewhere on the board.<br><br>Now, Daumantas has suggested that he's willing for you to participate in the dismantling of Austria--that's the carrot. The stick is that he'll come charging into the Ionian sooner rather than later if you don't. However, Turkey is also worried about a newly muscular Russia edging into the Balkans, and his build of an army rather than a fleet suggests that he's interested in shoring up his northern frontier at the very least. The French "nuclear option" of stepping aside and letting England through the Straits of Gibraltar is also only going to be a dissuasion for so long.<br/><br/>So I think that you want to put your finger on the scale on the eastern side of things. You need to tap Trieste with one of those armies. The other one <i>could</i> support you in--but maybe you'd rather maneuver. A purely defensive maneuver would be Tyr-Tri, Ven-Apu (letting you defend the peninsula in case Turkey does decide to come west). Alternately, you could order Ven-Tri, Tyr-Boh, which gives you a nice central position from which to cast your eyes around. It would give you some leverage over Russia and Germany, and more leverage over me--not, frankly, that you need it. <br/><br/>The army in Trieste can either hold (at which point I'm forced to disband a fleet that you then rebuild) or attack through to reach the front lines. The other army can continue to maneuver, feint in some direction perhaps, and perhaps help out in the big showdown in the north. Meanwhile, the fleet in the Western Med is supernumerary; bring it back to Tunis so that if Daumantas wants to force the Ionian he can't be sure whether he needs two fleets or three, and if he does decide to break through this turn you're in a position to cover all your exposed SCs in the fall.<br/><br/>-- Bill                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calculus" title="Calculus"><img alt="Calculus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calculus">Calculus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307183/#Comment_307183" name="Item_359" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-06T18:44:53+00:00" title="January  6, 2011  6:44PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 6, 2011 6:45PM by Calculus.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a game of rock paper scissors in the far east. Anyone attacking in any direction opens vulnerabilities from another.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat surprise "no-retreating into the place you were attacked from" rule certainly shook things up. Turkey was poised to kill Austria, and now it's anybody's guess which way Turkey will go. The Russian build in sev was no surprise, and it's not just an anti-Turkey build. That army can move northward to fill in the gaps from Russian movings in other direction. Not building would have put Russia at a disadvantage everywhere,<br/>\n<br/>\nDepending on what Austria thinks is going to happen, Galicia could be a possible move for them. It hands them nice choices in two directions, and allows them to build if Germany does not recapture Berlin. Another possibility would be to vacate Trieste in the spring or fall, and keep it clear with a bounce from other places.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the west, Germany is working on recapturing it's own SC's, while not loosing territories. It makes it a little tricky in that there are five territories they would need covered/taken, but only four units. Also Munich is vulnerable to Italy, and would be a pain for Germany to retake with English fleets to the north.<br/>\n<br/>\n-<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul">@Paul</a>, with the unexpected events in Austria you need to get your fleet back pronto. Attacking you has suddenly become a much more attractive option for Turkey. I appreciate the help. You've saved the Mediterranean for Mediterraneaners and kept yourself in the running for winning/surviving the game. (PS: You'll also want to keep an army in Venice this spring. Losing Venice would take you out of the game now because it would be almost impossible for you to retake.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href="/forums/profile/Eero">@Eero</a> - My fleets aren't moving north.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href="/forums/profile/Peter">@Peter</a> - Your most important priority this turn is to keep the things you've got. Bel, Hol, Keil, Mun. Priority two would be to retake Berlin. Three, nice to get it if you can, would be to arrange the fall so that you can build in Keil. If you want, I could move to Burgundy in the spring which would in the fall let me be able to either support you in Bel, support you back into Munich, or mutual bounce in Munch.  Just a word from you though, and I won't make that move. Let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href="/forums/profile/Daumantas">@Daumantas</a> - I know Fleet Ionian has been a PITA, and cramps your style much. I'd appreciate your non attacking the Ionian this spring with two fleets. After the spring, I'd still not prefer it, but I wouldn't feel obligated about responding to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307184/#Comment_307184" name="Item_360" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-06T18:46:25+00:00" title="January  6, 2011  6:46PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daumantas-<br><br>Would you care for an arranged bounce in Armenia?

If Turkey gobbles me up (heh), and your units are still sitting in Italy, you are in a bad position and I'm in a worse one, with no one there to help me. On the other hand, if you're in Trieste, you have influence over what happens: you can attack out, provide support to my beleaguered inland forces, and do all sorts of other nifty stuff. The way I look at it, I'm trading a (red) fleet for a (green) army--it's all about boots on the ground, baby. That's why I'd suggest Ven-Tri. I'd also suggest Tyr-Boh, because you heard Willow talk about joining up with Turkey to do some damage to me; an army in Boh lets you contribute to that discussion. The build you're likely to get makes you more defensible both from the east and from the west. Fuck Daniel's suggestion about covering Venice; the only force that can reach that SC is mine, in your line of march, and needs to get out of the way. If we can convince Willow that cracking Austria won't actually be all that easy now that you're in the game, maybe the three of us can combine against Turkey. And then we will see what we can see. -- Bill                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307201/#Comment_307201" name="Item_364" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-07T01:19:28+00:00" title="January  7, 2011  1:19AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul,<br/><br/>To be honest, this would not be so much a collaboration as a rivalry - who gobbles up more Austria faster. This turn, you should definitelly take Trieste if Bill's just giving it to you, while simultaneously putting (or keeping) yourself in position to support yourself into Vienna next year. You should also probably pull back from the French (unless you think you can weasel into Spain and are very very eager to show everyone that you and me are in cahoots) and defend Tunisia...<br/><br/>So next turn, you are free to do just about anything you like - support Austria if you think you can't get Vienna, and get Vienna if you think you can. With Bill so eager, you are in prime position to use him to your advantage - having him pull all of his forces against me, a natural enough reaction - and get a slice of Austria to call your very own while simultaneously making it impossible for me to get any gains easily.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307205/#Comment_307205" name="Item_365" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-07T02:09:31+00:00" title="January  7, 2011  2:09AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Willow,<br/><br/>After thinking about it again, it seems doubtful that you'd be able to gain two builds this year - owning Galicia is a prerequisite and Bill can counter that very easily. So the only use you actually get from our agreement is me ceding Rumania without a fight - I'd then ask you to attack Budapest so I could attack Serbia.<br/><br/>So gaining Rumania now is of no immediate use to you and of some eventual use to me.<br/><br/>If you are fine with that, then yes, sure, no funny stuff.<br/><br/>If you are not fine with that, then a bounce in Armenia and I'll be obliged to put up some sort of futile fight (succesful only if I can convice Bill that a Russia is a bigger threat to him than Turkey is in the long run, and that he should leave Bulgaria alone) over Rumania in the fall.<br/><br/><br/>It all comes down to how good a price you're putting on an okay-ish relationship with Turkey, which, since I can't really can't seem to get a read on you, is only for you to know.<br/><br/>Everything is currently setup for a bounce, which is the safer short-term option for Turkey.

The Italian situation is something of a morality on Diplomacy in a way - to me it says that you should always worry of your own nest first, as the western situation Italy chose to get concerned over in fact never was going anywhere (I'll say this again after the game if somebody is still doubting my estimate), while Turkey was certainly waiting for the opportunity. Now it'll be fighting time in the east, as Turkey's put Italy to the defensive and Russia joins the war against the musulman threat!<br/><br/>Regarding the western situation, I should clarify that the current English policy, as explained earlier, is to disengage and allow my southern neighbours to feel like they have the freedom to truly consider the situation objectively; I'll be glad to receive word from either of those worthies when and if they've decided that I'm not that awful after all - not larger, not more powerful, and not even morally degenerate in any way a Diplomacy player shouldn't be.<br/><br/>St. Petersburg, meanwhile, continues its time-share arrangement between the Russian and English empires, which I trust won't cause any undue difficulty for the Czarinna. Willow: I'll make the claim with a fleet, so don't feel obliged to mess your southern tactics this coming turn over this; I'm just loaning the place for that bit of extra zing, not preparing for a weird Russian assault.<br/><br/>Peter: I understand that you've stopped talking to me and all, but I can't help pointing out that you're a smidge exposed on your undercarriage there, if you know what I mean. Your call as to how to react, as always.<br/><br/>Daniel: MAO-Bre, Eng-MAO, Spa-MAO, probably no need to say more.<br/><br/>That tactical situation in the Mediterranean is delightful, here's how I see it going: Italy covers the threatened SCs and therefore builds one while moving south with the Venetian army; Austria and Italy set up an infantry line against Turkey (and Russia), while Russia allies with the Turk, maybe, or opts to ally with the others for the demise of Turkey (slow, that - much faster gains against Austria, probably). In the winter Italy builds a third fleet in Rome, and then starts the slow push back: once the new fleet gets to the Tyrhenian Sea Italy can force Turkey out of the Ionian <i>without</i> allowing the unit to slip through the line to the Tyrhenian.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Turkey has many interesting options. I'm especially considering a quick convoy of the Smyrna fleet to the Balkans - an excellent move if Russia's on-board against Austria, but potentially fatal otherwise. The Ionian fleet does not need a support, really, as it's an open question whether Turkey would want it on the Adriatic or Tyrhenian anyway. Turkey is clearly stymied if the Austro-Italian alliance holds and Russia doesn't join Turkey, so we might see a simple wilting of the Turkish fortunes. Definitely lots to talk about amongst the old enemies with the Black Sea between them.<br/><br/>Ultimately I'd say that Austria and Italy have managed to stabilize their situation in a way that makes them, united, dominant in the east, capable of fighting the Turk back ever so slowly. However, their alliance might not last if Italy perceives more utility in independence, and Russia might well find reason to throw her weight on the Turkish side to prevent Austria from recovering - as it is, Austria alone is weak, which is definitely to the advantage of the Czarinna as she considers the new extend of her domain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307269/#Comment_307269" name="Item_381" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-07T08:42:26+00:00" title="January  7, 2011  8:42AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, the dance, the beautiful dance!<br/><br/>If only I didn't have two left feet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307271/#Comment_307271" name="Item_382" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-07T09:02:39+00:00" title="January  7, 2011  9:02AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Of course, however, I am aware that this:<br/><br/><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>Paul -- Notice that if you'd moved Wes-Tun, you could now retreat to Naples and then in the fall possibly order Nap-TyS, Tun-TyS to prevent a Turkish end run on Rome. -- Bill</blockquote>\n...is really not for my benefit, but rather an attempt to draw Daumantas into moving West rather than concentrating on Austria.<br/><br/>What a bizarre but interesting game this is.<br/><br/>Jesus. I practically have to twist your arm to give you one of my SCs, and this is the kind of crap I have to take? Did you think Daumantas wasn't going to think of Ion-TyS himself? I wasn't the one who told him to go after the Ionian; he came up with that on his own. And now that you've got the care and feeding of Trieste, Ion-Adr is less scary to me than it once would have been (although still a concern). Frankly, Eas-Ion is the first sign I've seen in a long time that Turkey wasn't <i>single-mindedly</i> bent on Austrian destruction; it gives me hope for some kind of (albeit admittedly temporary) <i>rapprochement</i>, which could ultimately redound to <i>both</i> our benefit.<br/><br/>What I would like Army Trieste to do is <b>either</b> (1) Tri S Ser (i.e., support Serbia to hold) or (2) Tri-Alb (i.e., attack through to Albania). Roll a d6, 1-3 Tri S Ser, 4-6 Tri-Alb. Depending on Daumantas' maneuverings, either course may find you still in Trieste in the fall, at which point my fleet essentially changes colors. If not, my fleet is at your disposal.<br/><br/>Hey, Daumantas, I have the image of one of those action-movie scenes where two guys are wrestling for the gun--if one of them gets it, he's going to shoot the other, bang. But then <i>a third guy</i> shows up with a machine gun, and he's going to shoot them both. So how about we call a truce, and I help you maneuver against Russia? Think about it: T:Rum-Bla, T:Bul-Rum, A:Ser S Bul-Rum, T: Smy-Arm, and you've got a 2-on-1 attack on Sevastopol in the spring. Meanwhile, Russia loses StP and doesn't get Rum and is down to 3 units this winter. Both of our positions are improved considerably--yours more than mine, of course, but mine too.<br/><br/>Willow: Obviously I'm just kidding with Daumantas, trying to sucker him into not attacking me for another turn. I have no interest in seeing you debilitated once again after I worked so hard to save you from Germany. Don't worry; my unit in Budapest is going to support A Sev into Rumania, which should leave you at 4 SCs after you lose StP and Daumantas either down 1 or steady depending on how things break in the Balkans. Of course, if you want to keep Rumania, you have to stay the fuck out of Galicia; that shit I do not need again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307273/#Comment_307273" name="Item_383" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-07T09:17:38+00:00" title="January  7, 2011  9:17AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill is so amusing to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307356/#Comment_307356" name="Item_384" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-07T16:00:54+00:00" title="January  7, 2011  4:00PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill-<br/><br/>The support into Rumania is well appreciated!<br/><br/>Let's suppose we agree to DMZ Galicia- I will need that support, or see you order Ser-Bul, but you might have other plans for that unit.

This game certainly makes one a little... paranoid. But whether it was intentional or not, pointing it out now, after the fact, is very much to your advantage. To wit:<br/><br/>Daumantas,<br/><br/>As I see it, sending that fleet after Italian territory puts it more or less out of action. I can defend successfully against it, at least for a short time. Unless you're planning to push through towards France, I suppose.<br/><br/>However, do consider that having your fleet in range of Italy's shores, while unlikely to gain you another SC, *does* make it much much less likely that I'll move against Austria (as that would mean exposing my backside to you). If you want to encourage me to play defensively (in which case there's little I can do except support Austria in place)... well, I'm curious why.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307362/#Comment_307362" name="Item_386" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-07T16:34:01+00:00" title="January  7, 2011  4:34PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Willow,<br/><br/>I appreciate the advice, thank you!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307372/#Comment_307372" name="Item_387" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-07T17:35:49+00:00" title="January  7, 2011  5:35PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul -- No, I'm totally being strategic, but I don't want you to misunderstand the strategy.

My thinking was that T:Ion-Adr would be a crimp in our defense, since Alb-Tri would prevent Tri S Ser. So I gambled on Alb-Adr, hoping for a bounce; additionally, if you didn't order Tri S Ser but instead ordered Tri-Alb (as per my suggestion to roll a die), then if Daumantas successfully attacked Serbia, I'd have somewhere to retreat. You have to remember, my expectation was that I'd be disbanding a unit this year, and I wanted to make sure that I ended up with three armies on the board. I didn't think I'd have a fleet in the Adriatic past the winter. You are right to be cagey, though: once bitten, twice shy. But I am clearly pointing away from you now, and in fact attacking you at this juncture would leave me open to opportunistic attacks from all directions. My hope is that you will see the wisdom of our continued alliance for the immediate future, and its benefit to you in giving you scope to maneuver. -- Bill                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p7" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6">1</a><span class="Ellipsis">\u2026</span><a class=" p-5" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p5">5</a><a class=" p-6" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p6">6</a><a class=" p-7" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p7" rel="prev">7</a><a class="Highlight p-8" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p8">8</a><a class=" p-9" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p9" rel="next">9</a><a class=" p-10" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p10">10</a><a class=" p-11" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p11">11</a><span class="Ellipsis">\u2026</span><a class=" p-19 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p19">19</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p9" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F13448%2Fx%2Fp8%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F13448%2Fx%2Fp8%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[Diplomacy] Story Games League, Game 6 - Page 9 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p9" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="[Diplomacy] Story Games League, Game 6 - Page 9" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p9" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Bill, That makes some sense.

"Defending" Trieste is a losing proposition; you need to move that army to where it can help produce more SCs for our alliance. Army Trieste needs to either move south into Albania to put pressure on Turkey or north to Tyrolia to influence things in the center. If you're just going to sit still you're as good as cutting my throat--and yours too, eventually, so I'm appealing to your enlightened self-interest as well.

Disbanding army Armenia would be much more useful politically and possibly strategically, too.<br/><br/>Similarly, whether or not you keep Trieste occupied, Bill can reclaim it - the only issue is how many units he will be forced to put up for that task.<br/><br/>The only interesting option you can give me that I see is letting me have Serbia (either in exchange for Greece or out of the goodness of your heart or because you really should cut down the number of Austrian units next to Trieste to two). That means you would be giving up alliance with Bill, though, so I'm not holding my breath.

I'm assuming a build in Warsaw, then? Would you consider A Rum-Bud in the spring? You would already have a strong enough force to take Galicia without use of that unit, and there is no way I could take advantage of that move (barring the not too likely event of knowingly receiving support to Serbia from the Italian and Austria not doing anything to cut it).<br/><br/>Paul,<br/><br/>If you were to now build a an army in Rome, you'd have a continental force capable of manouvering, keeping your current holdings, and having a shot at Vienna (take Tyrolia while covering Venice with the Rome army, basically). If you do so, I would immediatelly remove myself from the Ionian, which we would then hopefully be able to keep demilitarized.<br/><br/>My other request would be for you to not have army Trieste either move Turkey-wards or support Serbia in place. This is useful to you, but only indirectly - Bill is very likely to try to reclaim Trieste this year, and you want to lower the Austrian to Italian unit ratio.<br/><br/>These are two separate offers, mind.

If you disband an unit in the fall retreats, it doesn't count against your unit count and thus you'll often get to rebuild it elsewhere. In this case Russia has only three units on board and four SCs (three home SCs and Rumania), so it's build-time in Kreml all over again despite the overall downturn. This sort of pro-technique is good for making rabid reversals from one theater of operations to another.<br/><br/>Turkey had a similar option with the fleet, note - could've removed that on retreat so as to effectively make his disband <i>before</i> everybody else, thus potentially gaining in trust from Russia by proving his intent to disarm on that flank. Perhaps Russia wants to get rid of that army in Armenia more, or Turkey wants to move the fleet to join the Mediterraneans, or he just prefers to keep it around to keep Russia honest. I know I'd keep the fleet if I was the only Power with one on the Black Sea.<br/><br/>Daniel, yes: seems that this is working for us. Just take care to not fall behind!<br/><br/>I find that Daumantas is right about the Italian tactical situation in that a third army would be full of opportunity and sparky mayhem, indeed. It's strategically tricky, though; an Italy intent on snuffing Austria better be sure that there is no firm Russo-Turkish alliance in the offing, as otherwise he'll be pretty quick to find that those two will easily overwhelm him in a fight over the Balkans. Basically Italy has the opposite requirements from what Russia would want from Turkey as an ally: A Turkey allied with Italy shouldn't put more than two fleets on the Mediterranean, at most, and even those should ideally be kept at home port; as long as such a Turk focused on building armies and expanding around the Black Sea regions and towards Russia, Italy would have relatively safe prospects for a mid- to long-term alliance. The fundamental problem is that the alliance is not really very profitable for Italy unless he's confidently seizing the Austrian home SCs at the least, but if he's doing that, then the Turk will find very limited benefit in trading an Austrian presence on his border for an Italian one; the border is just as difficult to keep peaceful with Italy on the other side as it is with Austria, and the Balkans simply are not very feasibly divided, especially not vertically. So the long-term strategic cooperation bears thinking about, it's not nearly as obvious as it is with Austria+Italy or Russia+Turkey.<br/><br/>Mostly as a matter of curiousity, my own play with Italy in this sort of situation might be to talk the Turk into retreating in exchange for me not building a third fleet (a reasonable trade, that), after which I'd use my new-found army strength in opportunistic foreign adventures for a little while. Three armies would allow me to keep one in Trieste supporting the line with the Austrian while another goes for Munich and a third for Marseilles, to pick an arbitrary example. Or, perhaps more interesting, I could send armies on the Italian "long march" towards Warsaw, that seems to always get a surprisingly good reception. Something marginal and relatively neutral towards my main neighbours, and something that keeps my forces close enough to recall in a couple of turns so that when they do seize something and I get more builds, I'll have a tempo advantage when I attack my real target from all sides at once.<br/><br/>A third army would also be pretty solid in an anti-Turkish play, assuming I managed to convince the Turk to retreat from the Ionian: occupy Albania and the Ionian, then make a bid for Greece with Austrian support. It's not like Italy needs a third fleet for anything if the Turk is willing to retreat from the Ionian environs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307760/#Comment_307760" name="Item_417" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-11T07:46:27+00:00" title="January 11, 2011  7:46AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grover</cite>The army in StP disbanded instead of retreating.</blockquote>\nOh, yeah, I missed that!

Here's the thing about Daumantas, Paul: He'll only do what you make him do. Once you built that army, why should he just sail home? He has no reason to, since he can just wait for your fleets to attack and then slip past them into the Tyrrhenian.

A friendly Russia is more important to me than a non-dead Austria, so won't be of much help in that, but if you want some kind of action plan against Italy, that could certainly be arranged.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307897/#Comment_307897" name="Item_430" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-12T09:46:25+00:00" title="January 12, 2011  9:46AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill,<br/><br/>But only one of the retreats is actually in question, is that not so?

I never agreed to such a plan (as you will find for yourself if you review our correspondence, above), so it's pretty bad form to call my defense of the Ionian a "breach of trust".

Right now though... Hapless opportunism coupled with about 50% of deals kept to ensure there is a reason to sometimes trust me after all.<br/><br/>As for intent... Well, I certainly will try to get an SC off you this year, if just for defensive keep-at-same-unit-count. If I can get Bill on the same boat, I'd certainly try to take even more.<br/><br/>But, even if I tried, I wouldn't be able to do much damage - our forces are more or less on par, and the only unit that can effectivelly attack you is a raider, which you'll probably have to swat around a bit. Plus, I'll get other issues that need solving sooner or later, and those will have to be addressed too.<br/><br/>That is to say, yes, I'll take what I can - but that likely won't be much and you're very much in position to stop me until things change. So you're a 'target' in a weak sense, but not in the strong sense of "I am out to get you until you are gone from the game." I don't think I ever have targets in the strong sense in Diplomacy, actually... Getting any seems like it'd lead to a troublesome waste of resources.<br/><br/>So yes. Good luck, Paul!

We could even set up a bounce in Moscow with Sev-Mos so she can cover both Sevastopol and Moscow with the same unit.<br/><br/>The German NMR here is a huge development, it's a sign of flagging fighting will on the part of the German people. Might be a prelude to a peace, or a period of anarchy, or even a feeding frenzy on the parts of the neighbours looking to take advantage before others take the best parts. A very powerful sign, and one that allows me to cut Kiel from Denmark, tactically speaking.<br/><br/>Willow: if you have nothing better to do with the Silesian army, do join in here in the German party. Berlin, for instance, seems like it doesn't entice the Kaiser anymore, so you might as well have it. Munich is also an interesting option, although you might have to work it out with the Italian - were I Paul, I'd definitely consider a free gift like that. Munich is pretty much going to fall to whoever takes it in the German repartition, and while I can't promise Berlin permanently to anybody coming to claim it with just a single army, a temporary possession is also good and can be leveraged to a more permanent position by adding troops or simply moving south to Munich later.<br/><br/>Daniel, too, obviously has a stake in the German situation; you know my long-term deal, and I'm willing to listen to counter-suggestions, too. Holland won't be supporting Belgium in place this year, I think you can take that for granted. And anything you claim this year I'll be happy to respect, or trade for equal value elsewhere next year as long as you don't increase the fleet build-up on the Atlantic side. Let me know what you think.<br/><br/>The Austro-Italian situation seems tactically tricky, as the Russo-Turkish alliance has gained a lot of momentum since last year. The naval situation is improving, though; Turkey can basically choose between a raid and a total loss of home port defense (worthwhile option for the resource disparity Italy needs to dedicate to block it, note), or a passive and submissive defense with two fleets against three. Assuming that the Austro-Italian alliance can keep coordinating effectively, the naval situation will only worsen until the Turk brings a third fleet into the fray. This is theoretically balanced by the opposition's superior land-based position, although the trade-offs could get tricky: I see no reason why the Austro-Italians couldn't keep Russian gains to a minimum and Turkish gains at null level while their fleets approach Turkish homelands. This is not a happy place to be for the Sultan as Russia grows stronger and his own enemies get closer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307917/#Comment_307917" name="Item_435" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-12T12:23:03+00:00" title="January 12, 2011 12:23PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Bill,<br/><br/>But only one of the retreats is actually in question, is that not so?

Turkey has to decide between audacity and prudence--does he go behind your lines into TyS, or retreat to the Eastern Med? If he retreats, he can hope to do in the southeastern corner what Eero did in the northwestern one: sit and wait for one of his antagonists to go down, and then take advantage; but Daumantas knows that kind of strategic patience ill-suits him. On the other hand, if he goes raiding, he can't be sure of making gains, and it leaves him more vulnerable in the Med than he might care for. As a third option, he might throw the dice and head for Apulia.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307927/#Comment_307927" name="Item_436" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-12T13:12:18+00:00" title="January 12, 2011  1:12PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero-<br/><br/>I quite like your idea of a Sev-Mos bounce, although it's a bit disingenuous to suggest the move does not effect me- you could just as easily covered St. Pete with a Finland army.<br/><br/>Daumantas<br/><br/>Would you order BLA S Ukr-Rum?<br/><br/>-Willow                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calculus" title="Calculus"><img alt="Calculus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calculus">Calculus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307961/#Comment_307961" name="Item_437" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-12T18:38:07+00:00" title="January 12, 2011  6:38PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 13, 2011 5:22AM by Calculus.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Germany's NMR puts France in a tight spot.

Hopefully the prospect of a real live juggernaut will concentrate the attention of the remaining Western powers, and then you can present yourself as an integral part of a pragmatic alliance to contain the Eastern steamroller. A couple of points:<br/><br/>(1) You should move A Tyr to Vienna; I expect to stay in Trieste. Russia will probably not bounce you there, since A Gal is probably heading for Budapest. <br/><br/>(2) Knowing that you might decide to attack Greece, I won't do anything that could cut support for such an attack.

But if I do that, then if Paul wants to order Ion S Adr-Gre, I cut that support. So I won't do that unless Paul wants me to, for whatever reason. Truth be told, I wouldn't mind sailing into the Ionian; that would give me a chance of grabbing Tunis and spending the rest of the game supporting units the Ionian, like a Visigoth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308085/#Comment_308085" name="Item_450" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-13T17:42:43+00:00" title="January 13, 2011  5:42PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I suppose that's true about Greece. I discounted it myself because I'm looking at the Italian situation through conservative lenses - it's usually easier for a new player to think in terms of full defense and slow offense, after all. You're correct in that doing something else aside from Ion-Tun (the obvious defensive move) is an option for Italy as long as Turkey takes it as a given that Italy'll play it, and won't therefore go for Tunis himself. Then again, I'm uncertain as to whether Turkey has any better moves than Tyr-Tun to make.<br/><br/>All that's pretty risky, though; is your situation really so bad that you couldn't just bunker down, clear the uncertainties in the line and then start a slow counter-strike against the east? Can Turkey and Russia put together the sort of long-term, heavy-pressure front they'll need to force their way into Austrian home SCs? It's not an easy situation for them, necessarily, as Russia will seek to benefit at the expense of Turkey at some point, and Turkey is relatively weak navally against Italy as long as the army line in Austria holds.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager"

I especially like how Italy took the risk and seized Greece in trade for Tunisia, that was a bold move. Austria still keeps Berlin, meaning that it's Austria at three and Italy at five against Turkey at five and Russia at five. Grim, but tactically Italy has prospects over there in the Turkish heartlands. It's a shame the other fleet went for the unlikely bounce in Rome, but Italy can compensate by building a third fleet.<br/><br/>Germany is not faring so well, on the other hand: the loss of two SCs and the continuing failure to reoccupy Berlin mean that Germany's playing with two SCs and therefore two units for the next year. Were I playing there, I'd work hard to see if the English are still amenable to <i>any</i> sort of peace - French probably aren't, considering their prime position for annexing Germany entire.<br/><br/>England, France, Russia and Italy are building, while Austria and Germany are removing units, and Turkey is remaining the same, unless there's a disband at retreat coming. Austria'll probably disband the fleet, as the naval war is slow and not as important; Germany'll remove the fleet and one of the armies; what the others do is anybody's guess.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308166/#Comment_308166" name="Item_458" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-14T08:48:10+00:00" title="January 14, 2011  8:48AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>England, France, Russia and Italy are building</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>but Italy can compensate by building a third fleet</blockquote>\nI wish that were true!

The important thing is the forced destruction of the Russian army, which reduces the overall amount of force the enemy has available in the fall. These sorts of unit-heavy all-out slugfests are ultimately won by having more force on position more consistently than the enemy, so any moves that allow you to put more of your units into contact with the enemy line while denying the same to the enemy will result in advancement for your side. The reason for the immediate tactical advantage the Austro-Italian alliance enjoys here is that half of the Russo-Turkish army force is out of touch in internal Russia; the situation will balance out in the fall if and when Russia manages to bring more armies into touch, but right now three of Russia's five armies are up north where the only place they can touch is Galicia. From the Austro-Italian viewpoint it's important to move decisively and without trivial mistakes now that there is a window of operations available; if time is allowed to waste and Russia gets the luxury of lining up the full force in actually relevant positions, then the situation won't seem nearly as good for the western clique. Strike while the iron is hot, in other words.<br/><br/>The naval situation is fucked up in comparison now that Turkey invested so very heavily in fleets. Italy can try to seize Tunis (50% chance) by supporting himself first into Tyr and then into Tun, but then loses the Ionian in trade in the fall if the Turkish fleets are allowed to go to Aeg and Eas unopposed. Opposing them, on the other hand, only delays them - one of the fleets goes to Aeg in the spring regardless, while the other can be supported out in the fall. The long-term situation seems so problematic that I'd probably go for Tunis here, willfully losing the Ionian again; that'd allow me a build in the winter for a third fleet in Naples, which would then at least balance the naval build-up. Turkey will still probably get a pretty good shot at Greece next year, but perhaps the army line has advanced sufficiently before then to allow the armies to withstand the naval offensive for a while on their own. Basically it's going to be Turkey's game in the Mediterranean for now, though - the solution to the problem has to be found in propping up Austria, gaining builds from the continent and pressuring Turkey in Bulgaria.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308426/#Comment_308426" name="Item_480" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-16T10:20:49+00:00" title="January 16, 2011 10:20AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero --<br/><br/>What about A:Gal-Bud, A:Tri S Gal-Bud, I:Tyr-Boh, I:Vie S Tyr-Boh?

If your army were to go instead to Denmark in the spring, that could be to your long term advantage and I'd be willing to support you into Holland and Berlin in the fall if needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo need to agree or disagree, though alternative proposals are fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308447/#Comment_308447" name="Item_486" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-16T12:58:25+00:00" title="January 16, 2011 12:58PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good idea about the division of Germany, Daniel - that point about the army movements is especially well-founded, and the border you suggest truly is stable. I wonder about whether you are satisfied with minority pickings off the carcass, though. I'm trying to figure out how to have you in Berlin, but it's difficult long-term...<br><br>How about this: you take Berlin and Belgium this year, while I convoy to Denmark. Next year I'll take Berlin and prepare for an eastern offensive (Livonia, etc.), while you set up to do your thing in the Tyrolian area and the Mediterranean. This way you'll at least get a considerable tempo advantage off Berlin, which you can perhaps trade in for permanent gains in 1910 elsewhere. I could even conseivably support you into Warsaw in 1910 as a second semi-stable position, unless you found more use for that particular army down south. Having you in Berlin on a permanent basis seems like a futile gesture (too easy for me to pick off), but a visit could be arranged.<br><br>(That Liverpool fleet should be a non-issue in the long term; I'm considering vacating the English Channel and leaving that fleet in the Irish Sea or thereabouts if an eastern strategy truly flowers.)<br><br>Regarding the eastern situation, I don't have any particular secret motivations about it - I just happened to consider the tactical situation and decided to post my conclusions. Truth is that I'd like to see Austria and Italy survive their current situation, so it'll be interesting to see whether they will; the tactical situation is high-risk in that Austria does not have any room for mistakes, but the immediate position seems playable, assuming no mistakes from the Austro-Italians. It would be a great shame if the Juggernaut were to overrun their positions just because they lack coordination at this critical juncture.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308449/#Comment_308449" name="Item_487" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-16T13:36:46+00:00" title="January 16, 2011  1:36PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br><br>I hear you!

It was drizzeling and dark and cold and I was hunched behind a tree.  Steve and I were the only ones left, crouched on a ridgeline. Accross a creek and up another ridge the enemy laughing was talking, laughing, shining flashlights into the woods, and presumeably drinking hot chocolate.<br/>\n<br/>\nTAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT. A stream of paintballs impacted an inch above my head. Fragements of bark hit my hair. I hit the ground, sprayed paintballs wildly behind me, and rolled to other side of the tree.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was silence.<br/>\n<br/>\n"What do we do now?!" I hissed. Steve could hear the fear in my voice.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Relax. Think about it, he's in the dark, he's alone, and we are between him and all his friends. Let's just kill him."<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we did.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou've got two on his one. You'll take Tunisia back eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\nFleet Tunisa is a pain, but it's no mortal threat. You've just got to move fleet Rome to Tyr, but you'd be doing that regardless. He can't hurt you any more as long as you have Tyr. Just randomly send fleet Ionian moving to support Tyr or move to the Aegean - that gives Turkey failure options on both sides.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calculus" title="Calculus"><img alt="Calculus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calculus">Calculus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308508/#Comment_308508" name="Item_489" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-17T07:14:22+00:00" title="January 17, 2011  7:14AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, sounds like a plan.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll flip a coin, tails and I'll move to Berlin.

I'd say that the borders are basically manageable due to our largely unbalanced unit counts that prevent decisive action one way or the other. Therefore what mostly needs to happen is for the remnants of the German Power to die off out of the way, after which the rest should basically take care of itself as long as we don't entangle ourselves navally in risky and over-extended operations on the other party's turf. I mean, tactically there's not much in the way of stakes here, unless you start thinking that you can take and hold Kiel by force or something like that. We can just wrassle for a couple of turns, and things should slot down the same way whether we're in agreement or not.<br><br>The ultimate solution to the transient tensions we have in the German areas will naturally occur once better enemies are engaged in the east. On my part the route is pretty obvious, and ultimately you'll have a limited selection of venues as well; we'll just need to both unilaterally make plans and execute them, trusting in the basic impossibility of waging a conclusive war over our coastal border with forces that are largely unsuited to the same. Some possibilities of cooperation against east are present, even, although it's nothing major considering our respective focuses - mainly you might consider allotting the Berlin army to helping out in Poland next year, stuff like that.<br><br>In other words: get Holland out of the way, prepare for an eastern war and execute once it becomes obvious that the other guy can't make a credible war against you anyway. We're not in any hurry about opening new fronts, so let's just pick our moment and look for surprise - any seemingly belligerent action between our forces in the meantime will only enforce the suddenness once an opening is perceived.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308688/#Comment_308688" name="Item_498" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-18T17:25:21+00:00" title="January 18, 2011  5:25PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill,<br><br>Russia, until my brain understands lies?<br><br>Daniel,<br><br>I would, like to, hear your thoughts on your Southern fleet...                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calculus" title="Calculus"><img alt="Calculus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calculus">Calculus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308692/#Comment_308692" name="Item_499" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-18T17:49:41+00:00" title="January 18, 2011  5:49PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2011 5:52PM by Calculus.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Eero">@Eero</a>.

If we bounce, I'll at least be blocking the raider from getting around to TYR.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href="/forums/profile/Daumantas">@Daumantas</a> - Don't be so sad <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> - the fall looks to go the way of BearPirate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308700/#Comment_308700" name="Item_500" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-18T19:28:57+00:00" title="January 18, 2011  7:28PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul --<br><br>I hope you've noticed the tactical ironies of the naval battle around Tunis. You know that TyS-Tun, Ion S TyS-Tun probably fails, since there's nothing else for T:F Eas to do but Eas-Ion, which cuts the support for your attack. Therefore, the obvious solution is TyS S Ion-Tun, expecting to lose the Ionian but gain a build. But if I understand the rules correctly, the obvious Turkish play under those circumstances is Tun-Ion supported by Eas, which means that the equally well-supported countervailing attacks from Tun and Ion bounce. The basic principle of attacking out of a threatened province that you expect to lose applies. Note that using Aeg to support the attack from Tunisia as well turns the bounce into a rout for F Ion, but F Aeg will probably be responsible for launching a spoiling attack on Greece. Ironically, however, if you attack from TyS under those conditions, even without support, the attack from Tunis <i>succeeds</i>, F Ion is displaced as the Turkish fleet sails forth, and F TyS sails into Tunisia unopposed. In that case, Turkey is better off with T:Tun hold, T:Eas-Ion -- but then Ion-Tun, TyS S Ion-Tun is a winner, even though it gives up the Ion. Alternately, since you're going to lose Ion anyway no matter what you do, you might just go ahead and order TyS-Lyo, Ion-TyS, Tyr-Pie and fuck France for not helping you out.<br><br>My point is that what seems like the obvious move on the surface may be exactly what your opponent expects, and the move that seems sub-optimal may work better. I am emphatically not making any recommendation, however. As always, I suggest rolling a die.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p9" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6">1</a><span class="Ellipsis">\u2026</span><a class=" p-7" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p7">7</a><a class=" p-8" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p8">8</a><a class=" p-9" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p9" rel="prev">9</a><a class="Highlight p-10" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p10">10</a><a class=" p-11" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p11" rel="next">11</a><a class=" p-12" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p12">12</a><a class=" p-13" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p13">13</a><span class="Ellipsis">\u2026</span><a class=" p-19 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p19">19</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p11" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F13448%2Fx%2Fp10%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F13448%2Fx%2Fp10%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[Diplomacy] Story Games League, Game 6 - Page 11 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p11" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="[Diplomacy] Story Games League, Game 6 - Page 11" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13448/diplomacy-story-games-league-game-6/p11" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Bill, And what of my earlier question?

After all, if you always use the same heuristic in choosing your moves, then the opponent will also know what you're going to move, and thus they will have an advantage over you. On the other hand, consistently making suboptimal moves that'll only pan out in unlikely circumstances will ensure your defeat, which is why "one in six" or so is probably a pretty good ratio for indulging in foolishness. Just often enough to make the opposition doubt their predictions.<br/><br/>You might remember that Bill has referenced the similar dictum of "rolling dice" between equally valid move-sets to ensure that the opponent can't predict your moves on a psychological basis. Whether any of this is a good idea or not is a very complex and interesting question of Diplomacy strategy. I wouldn't deny any of it off-hand, but I have to say that I often feel confident enough to try to counter-predict my opponent instead of merely playing unexpected moves myself. Who predicts and who merely optimizes (or randomizes, as the case might be) their moves is a matter of psychological initiative after all, so there's no reason why I couldn't always play on the basis of what I imagine my opponent to be moving instead of merely randomizing my own moves, at least as long as my gut keeps up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308784/#Comment_308784" name="Item_510" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-19T13:10:32+00:00" title="January 19, 2011  1:10PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul --<br/><br/>I get that you expected Rum-Bul to succeed, but as a move it was <i>so obvious</i> that there was no way that anyone who had a stake in it wouldn't have bet money that that's what I was going to do, and taken pains to prevent it. I'll quote myself: "The basic principle of attacking out of a threatened province that you expect to lose applies." I'll admit that I was expecting T:Aeg-Gre to cut I:Gre S Rum-Bul rather than T:Aeg S Bul, but the effect was the same: impossible for Rum-Bul to succeed. <br/><br/>Now, I could have ordered Ser S Rum, Bud S Rum, but I expected that Willow would play the best move set at her disposal, with A Gal attacking to spoil Bud S Rum and an attack coming from the Ukraine supported by Sevastopol. So I knew I wasn't going to hold Rum, and I knew that Rum-Bul was pointless. Given that, I expected to end the turn with 3 SCs; I needed to decide whether I should allow A Rum to disband so that I could rebuild in Trieste, or attack into Galicia to be in a position to do some central European infighting. I decided it was worth it to attack back into Galicia, since that would go a long way toward protecting newly liberated Budapest. Eero sounds skeptical about the point of Rum-Gal, but I knew my opponents well enough to be sure that I wasn't going to do any better than I'd already done--I was sitting on Budapest, after all, which I'd given up temporarily in order to keep the pressure on Turkey. Once I knew that A Gre wasn't going to do anything stupid like attack Bulgaria (which would have left it vulnerable to a Turkish attack), it made sense to order Ser S Gre, preventing a Turkish attack from having a chance succeeding there. I knew Russia was going to have to disband, and there was a 50/50 chance that Turkey would lose Tunis. I would have been left with three SCs and three armies right in the middle of the fight, and an open home SC to build in if I made any gains during the next year. That was about as good as I could have hoped for, given the tenacity and cleverness of the opposition.<br/><br/>Now, in the scheme of the larger fight, I suppose you might reasonably assert that an (Italian) fleet in Naples is more valuable than an (Austrian) army in Galicia, but as an alliance move Tyr-Tri is just pointless. If you really thought that Rum-Bul was going to work, with a 4th SC I could have built a fleet in Trieste and brought it into the fight in the Med, and the army in Tyrolia could have warded off the Russian army in Bohemia and kept the door shut on France. And it would have kept me happy, under the illusion that our alliance was working to bring me back from the brink. Deprived of that illusion, I'm no longer motivated to stay on side. So even as a stab I'm not sure that Tyr-Tri was all that smart, although I could be wrong about that; it may work out fine for you.<br/><br/>Willow --<br/><br/>Don't disband A Boh! In the spring, I'll support you into Vienna. If you then could see your way clear to supporting me into Trieste in the fall, I'd consider it a favor.<br/><br/>Daumantas --<br/><br/>You can expect to be able to attack Greece successfully in the spring.<br/><br/>-- Bill                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308787/#Comment_308787" name="Item_511" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-19T13:35:40+00:00" title="January 19, 2011  1:35PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 19, 2011 1:40PM by Paul_T.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Bill,<br/><br/>Don't forget this is all pretty new to me! This is effectively my first game of Diplomacy (while I do have another one on the way, it's also still in 1908, and in that game I haven't had the opportunity to engage in any diplomacy or negotiations, since everyone I could reasonably interact with has been full-on hostile).<br/><br/>Your logic makes sense to me, now that you point it out, but I don't entirely have the experience with this game to have seen that outcome as clearly. You might have, uh, discussed some of these things sooner with me?<br/><br/>My expectation for this turn was that you would find a way to hold steady, and I figured I had a good chance of losing Greece (I didn't expect your support there), so I needed another build somehow, or I would quickly be entirely unable to support you at all (as you can see for yourself, if you look at the Southern situation, where Turkey outnumbers me in fleets). Even if you had been the one to reach a new build first, it would have been at least a year further down the road, not in time to stop a potential Turkish advance.<br/><br/>I need that fleet much more than I need Austrian territory--once I have it (which I now do), I'm happy to return Vienna and Trieste to you. Otherwise, frankly, I don't think we have a chance. From what little I know of Willow and Daumantas's tactics, they're unlikely to leave you alive for too long if you do choose to turn on me, but rather use you to take me down, and then get us both out of the way. I'm happy to keep my supporting role on the mainland now that I finally have a decent navy established, and that includes getting out of the way so as to help you rebuild Austria. I don't really think either of us has much of a chance to survive alone at this point.<br/><br/>You can also see from my moves ordered this year that I was already planning to trade Vienna for Trieste--I was picturing a potential of my army in Galicia for the same reasons you listed, if you doubt my motives here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308788/#Comment_308788" name="Item_512" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-19T14:08:01+00:00" title="January 19, 2011  2:08PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 19, 2011 2:56PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In case you two need an outside perspective, I think that Italy definitely needs Austria - the situation is very much in tactical equilibrium, the two Austrian armies are more than enough to throw the overall Balkans war any which way (except perhaps Austria's way, sadly). Italy should either think up a very clean, very quick stab, or do whatever it takes to convince Austria that there is a continuous political intent present for Austria's survival. Personally I'd definitely go for a surviving Austria here, as I can't off-hand see how even a clean stab would leave Italy with sufficient traction to oppose the Juggernaut. Only if I had secret knowledge about forthcoming political troubles between Turkey and Russia would I take the risk.<br/><br/>Tactically it might not be a bad idea to disband the Serbian army. That's a relatively easy hole for Italy to plug from Trieste. Then again, if Russia keeps the Bohemian army, Italy well might have to play to Tyrolia simply to prevent an aggravating raid into Venice. Perhaps getting rid of the Galician army makes the most sense if the Italo-Austrians are not feeling like making a complex offensive push in-land; Galicia isn't that useful without such intent, and in the current situation that sort of thing would be difficult to accomplish successfully.<br/><br/>Tactically the immediate in-land situation is a stalemate, assuming Austria and Italy can keep it together - they have four inland armies against four Russo-Turkish armies in the Bul-Rum-Gal-Boh cordon, which means that neither side is really going to make much progress, especially as the Turko-Russians have depth of defense in their fleets and support armies that ensure the maintenance of the Bul-Rum positions. What this means is that long-term the situation will either be resolved by Austria cracking (letting the Russians in, basically) or by naval operations - whichever side gets naval superiority will be able to roll up the flank and support their armies in aggression. Russo-Turks have a slight advantage in that they have more depth to take risks with, which means that they can try certain variant offensives that might work with luck, but they don't have unlimited time to experiment with, assuming that the Italian naval war starts moving and Turkey needs to start focusing on homeland defense.<br/><br/>It occurs to me that it'd be really funny if Russia retreated to Silesia from Galicia. Hilarious, and diplomatically very proactive, considering how it'd take off pressure from Austria and Italy. Could even be an immediate cause for some Italo-Austrian falling-out when the Russian threat recedes a bit, and at least Turkey would start feeling more of the pressure. Going through with it would require disbanding Warsaw, I suppose, but if Austria disbanded Galicia at the same time the board would look totally different from the current situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308794/#Comment_308794" name="Item_513" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-19T15:44:26+00:00" title="January 19, 2011  3:44PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero makes good sense, as always.

(Depends on tactics at this point.) If anything you should be trying to figure out how to prevent Daniel from overrunning Germany, which well might be the outcome if I mess up my tactics this year.<br/><br/>As for the eastern position, I concur with Bill insofar as the tactical realities go - you should be able to hold the line on the continent for the 2-3 years it'll take to regain your naval positions. Tactically the immediate naval situation is tricky due to the 50/50 choices involved, but I have confidence that the Italian position is slightly better than the Turkish one. Just don't fear losing Greece too much (trading Greece for Tunisia on the spring move is good for you, as you have a fair chance of retaking Greece in the fall, depending on the particulars), coordinate for an active continental move-set with Austria to put potential pressure on Bulgaria, and guess right on whether Turkey'll support Tun-Ion or not. Consider Tyr-Wes, Gre-Bul and other such liminal moves as well as the more obvious tacks; think over the whole opportunity space to find the moves that will have good outcomes against what you think the opposition will move.<br/><br/>Ultimately the resolution of the eastern triangle will pretty likely be down to the Turko-Russians - whichever first finds a position for a stab will likely end up splitting the east with Italy, given high-level play on both sides. My money is currently on the Turk, as Russia will have to over-extend tactically to make any progress against Austria at the moment; that makes it very easy for the Turk to make a fall convoy to an empty Sevastopol, for example (at least as long as the naval war has not progressed to the Turkish home SCs, which will in any case take years). Any stab in a trench war like this, where all forces are already most committed, will be decisive. This is problematic from the Austrian viewpoint in that many would consider the correct Italian response to be to use the confusion among enemy ranks for a big push, followed by ousting Austria from the game to run for the finish line alone (or with the Turko-Russian stabber at least, whichever it'd be). Exciting times ahead in 2-3 years, I predict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308997/#Comment_308997" name="Item_521" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-21T17:24:50+00:00" title="January 21, 2011  5:24PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daumantas,<br/><br/>I feel your angst, being a totally locked-in-the-corner Turkey in my other Diplomacy game.<br/><br/>Is there a way to make things more interesting for you?

I'd need some concrete assurance, then I'll do it--just like you rolled a 7-9.)</blockquote>\nThis type of conundrum is of fundamental interest in Diplomacy strategy: how to proceed from an aggressive posture to a cooperative one without creating undue openings for betrayal, when both sides would probably only need that one good opening for dominating the other? This is further complicated in this particular game by the fact that everybody can follow along on your negotiations, meaning that the only surprise you may have for complex ploys is in uncertainty, which also often transmits to your intended ally... tricky and delighting to figure out.<br/><br/>Were I playing the position as Italy, I wouldn't consider Gre-Tun, Ion C Gre-Tun, Nap S Ion H, Tyr S Gre-Tun an awful move, all told; Turkey could foil it by attacking Tun-Ion, but that's a danger to Turkey as well in that Italy could be playing eg. Tyr-Tun, Ser-Rum, Bud S Ser-Rum, Gre-Bul (takes Tunis and maybe Rumania) instead. Most importantly, the cooperative option here is unilateral in that Turkey doesn't actually need to make a special spring move to pull off this thing; as long as his move doesn't outright foil the convoy, he easily has many valid moves to consider. Therefore he has ample luxury for trying it out. As for Italy, the convoy is a valid 50/50 move in attacking Tunisia, and if it pulls through, the position is genuinely valid for Turkish cooperation, regardless of whether Turkey trusted Italy to really be going for the convoy a priori; thus, after the fact negotiations may proceed smoothly if the convoy goes through. So overall the convoy is not any worse as a move than a standard offensive move, except for the fact that it trades the security of Greece (which Turkey might or might not attack anyway) for the diplomatic potential gained by the disarmament move. It's only valuable if Italy wants a Turkish peace, but if he does, then an uncertain hold on Greece and Tunis might be a good trade for a firm hold on Tunis and peace.<br/><br/>From a Turkish viewpoint the plan is excellent, I don't wonder at all why Daumantas suggested it - no reason whatsoever from his viewpoint to not wait and see for one turn, considering the relatively static tactical situation. It's true that Italy might smoothly talk Turkey into some minor discomfort by moving something completely different, but there is no major stake there as long as Turkey makes a solid defensive move (Aeg-Gre, say). The advantage for Turkey is considerable as long as Italy says that it's going to go for it: either Turkey gains a drastically shifting position and a strong ally where he only had a slowly losing naval battle, or he gains the absolute certainty that Italy's going for blood - this latter is important in long and slow trench wars, as this is not a position where betrayal comes trivially: if Italy talks up the trade of Tun for Gre and then uses the goodwill for a minor tactical advantage on the Mediterranean, that'll be a massive power-up for the Russo-Turkish alliance, who can then play for years in absolute certainty that neither may trust in any Italian overtures. (In case you're wondering, diplomatic value is a real thing in this game: it influences the cross-Power tactical relations, which translates into strength or weakness caused by mutual trust or distrust. An Italy that betrays Turkey directly feeds power into the land-war in Rumania, which largely depends on the working relationship between Russia and Turkey.)<br/><br/>The strategic value of betrayal goes to the other direction as well to some degree; as discussed above, it's not obvious to Turkey that he'll have an advantage by betraying Italy here, as it's possible that Italy is betraying him <i>as well</i>, in which case trying to foil a convoy to Tunis by moving Tun-Ion could be the very move Italy is expecting. However, putting aside the strategic situation, Turkey betraying Italy would obviously affirm for Italy that no further compromise with Turkey is possible: at the moment the two (Turkey, really; Italy has other outlets) have just about as many fleets as they can have and still credibly make peace, but if Turkey betrays Italy, then it'll be obvious to all that Turkey's playing for keeps - it's Mediterranean domination or bust for him. The diplomatic significance here is not as major as it'd be the other way around, as it seems to me that the Austro-Italian working relationship is much better than the Russo-Turkish one, but it's still considerable. If nothing else, a Russia fully confident about Italian motivation in fighting against Turkey will find it much, much easier to make peace with Austria and stab Turkey.<br/><br/>Considering the above points, I'd be extremely surprised if either of you two betrayed this sort of deal once you managed to make it in a circumspect way that didn't give out too much for third parties. Of course my saying this out loud affects your judgment (for one, it makes the surprise all the greater when you actually betray each other), but it still seems such an irreversible diplomatic action to betray each other at the moment that I'd be surprised if either of you would be willing to pay the price for the minor tactical benefit available. It would only make sense if either of you has already concluded in your private analysis that the other absolutely has to die for you to win, and therefore the only reason to be talking to each other in the first place is to gain those minor tactical benefits from small betrayals. No, the much more credible way of not making the Gre-Tun trade is to outright deny the offer (or perhaps not comment at all), as that leaves open the option of negotiating later, when you do really need to be able to work together.<br/><br/>All that being said, in practice I'd probably move Ion-Tun, Nap-Ion, Gre-Alb (or Gre H) instead of that convoy, no matter what I promised to Turkey; if the Turk is trusting enough to not even support himself into Greece, that's his failure, and if he does support, then I can retreat to Albania with no harm done and have my fleets in credible positions both for western offense and eastern defense. The convoy plan is non-optimal in that the Naples fleet doesn't get to an effective position during the spring if neither the Tyrhenian or Ionian fleets move. Moving Tyr-GoL would be a heady move for Turkish alliance, but it would also mean that taking Tunis would fail horribly if Turkey <i>didn't</i> move out of Tunis voluntarily; I probably wouldn't take the risk myself unless I had a really good feel for the Turk and he explicitly said that he's going to vacate Tunis under his own power.<br/><br/>Perhaps the way I'd go if I wanted to pursue this sort of sudden turn would be to be non-committal and then just move Ion-Tun without ceremony - if Turkey is similarly enticed, he'll play along (attacks Greece, doesn't attack Ionian, perhaps vacates Tunis, etc.) without any explicit agreement. As mentioned above, it's 50/50 anyway as to which move would take Tunis and what Turkey should do, so neither side is actually objectively making a bad move by choosing the option that just happens to end up with a clean separation of forces and a chance for peace. If both choose to play along, then it'll happen without any need for talking.<br/><br/>Whether all this means that Italy and Turkey would be implicitly selling Austria and Russia up the river by teaming up is an interesting topic for some other time <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309057/#Comment_309057" name="Item_527" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-22T04:03:41+00:00" title="January 22, 2011  4:03AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 22, 2011 4:05AM by DWeird.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul,<br/><br/>T'is no secret that I go where the SCs are.

Turko-Russians now have a definite upper hand in the east; the Austro-Italians will have to guess right on defense to beat back the odds and prevent enemy progress. Italy would in fact have a lot of use for some French support now that a French army is in the vicinity - I suggest talking about it, the downfall if Italy would have extreme consequences for the entire Europe.<br/><br/>Now that the war turned so heavily to the advantage of Turkey, the strategic tension in the Turko-Russian alliance hikes up to unforeseen levels: Turkey has the very realistic, very powerful option of simply moving to claim Sevastopol, claiming two builds for the year and trusting in the chaos caused by the successful Russo-Austrian war to carry him through who knows how far; Russia is over-committed to the Austrian war at the moment, but will soon recover if Austro-Italian defense crumbles, so now is the moment. The tragic bit for the Juggernaut is that if Russia does not use the opportunity and hammer home the assault on Austrian home SCs, then she can cover himself, but not progress anywhere. It's the classic conundrum of trust for advance and betrayal for resolution.<br/><br/>Meanwhile France is riding strong here in the west, and it's up to me to prove to Daniel that a northern war is not an option. What fun.<br/><br/>Tactical notes for the Austro-Italians, you guys should definitely not fail now. (Note that I'll just ignore your recent falling-out - you can of course both lose spectacularly by fighting each other as the Juggernaut rolls over you if you want, but I fail to see a route to victory in that course of action.)<br/><br/>The junctures between Powers in the trench line are important, as those are spots where an attack cannot be realized without prior coordination. This ensures that Serbia, for example, may be cut, but cannot be taken without prior warning realistically - neither Russia nor Turkey will take the risk of attacking or supporting the attack without knowing that the other is going to help out. For this reason we can say with confidence that only Vienna and Budapest are under immediate danger. The tricky part is that the loss of Greece puts pressure on the Austro-Italians to make commensurate gains; this sort of trench war will be lost surprisingly quickly if losses are allowed to accumulate.<br/><br/>Bulgaria will practically have to support Greece in place, as it's pretty natural for the Ionian to attack Ion-Gre with Albanian support. Cutting Bulgaria with Serbia is a very natural move here, but do note that it does not guarantee success for the attack; Turkey can defend Greece by attacking Gre-Ion with fleet support, bouncing the attack with an equally strong counter-attack. The counter-attack ploy in turn is foiled by simply allowing Turkey to move out, or alternatively by having Serbia support the attack in. However, Serbian support is foiled again by cutting it from Bulgaria. The end-result is that the war for Greece will be a guessing game that connects with the Tunisian guessing game: F Ion either attacks Tunis or attacks Greece, Tunis either attacks Ion or holds, Eas either supports Tun-Ion or Gre-Ion, Serbia either cuts Bulgaria or supports Gre-Ion, Bulgaria either cuts Serbia or supports Greece. Serbia can do either of those moves and still be useful for retaking Greece, but supporting the attack is of course only useful if the Ionian actually attacks. There is no way for Italy and Austria to communicate the fact of attack in advance without spoiling it, as Turkey has a counter if he knows what's coming.<br/><br/>Meanwhile the northern defense can be broken down thusly: you can play Tri S Vie H, Vie S Bud H, Bud S Ser-Rum, Ser-Rum, and that'll defend successfully against anything but Bla-Rum, Rum-Bud, Gal S Rum-Bud, Boh-Vie. That particular move-set by Russo-Turks is somewhat unlikely, as they'd have to coordinate it; not entirely impossible if Austro-Italians are very loud about coordinating this particular defense, in which case both Willow and Daumantas might just separately use their heads and opt for the very attack I'm spelling out as the counter <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> Still, rather far-fetched.<br/><br/>The weakness of the above defense-by-cutting-Rum (aside from its passivity) is of course that it doesn't have much synergy with the southern decision matrix. If Serbia participates in the southern defense instead, then the northern situation is harder: either France needs to help out or the defense needs to outguess Russia. Basically Trieste has to support either Vienna or Budapest in place, and Russia has to make a supported attack on the same place. Note that mutual support doesn't help, as Russia will obviously cut both Vienna and Budapest anyway. A classical 50/50 defense situation. If France helps out (and he should - if I can somehow help convince Daniel, let me know), then both positions can obviously be supported.<br/><br/>(I should note that there is an external game here as well: Russia might go for Munich, France might go for Venice. Because the Venetian offensive is particularly useless for France in all ways imaginable, I'll not concern myself with these options for the moment; if France wants Italy to fall, you've already lost, and so have us western Powers.)<br/><br/>There is a black horse option here as well in that Austria can attack Rumania; it's the only position aside from Greece and Tunis down south that may be assaulted by the western alliance at the moment. (The empty spaces in Galicia and whatnot are not worthwhile targets; a war like this lives or dies on material advantage.) An attack on Rumania should probably be made by moving Bud-Rum, Ser S Bud-Rum, Tri-Bud (or perhaps Tri S Vie H if France is not playing along). The attack on Rumania has good chances of happy outcome in that it bounces Rum-Bud and breaks Rum S Gal-Bud, and of course gains a build off Rumania. The weakness of the move (aside from the fact that the Grecian attack probably is not an option if Serbia does not participate) is that Turkey's second-most likely move with F Bla is supporting Rumania on hold. (The likeliest is an attack on Sevastopol.)<br/><br/>The most favourable Russian attack on Austria at the moment is Rum S Gal-Bud, because that move allows Turkey to support Rumania in place, countering the Rumanian assault in the last paragraph. This does not obviously mean that Russia will play it, as it's much more important to out-guess the opponent in this sort of tight spot.<br/><br/>The coordination problems in the northern defense are real, as Italy needs to know what to do with the army in Trieste: either it supports a randomly chosen unit in Vienna or Budapest, or it supports Budapest because France promised to support Vienna, or it moves to Budapest to bounce Galicia as Budapest marches on Rumania. Then there is Serbia, too, which has crucially differing options as well. Perhaps Italo-Austrians can coordinate in some clever manner and not give the plan away.<br/><br/>(I don't cover one variant move-set above, the possibility of playing Ser-Rum and Alb-Ser. It's a bit problematic, and doesn't offer much advantage.)<br/><br/><b>Summary:</b><br/><br/>Italy can still carry the day down south by guessing right in Tunis and/or Greece, but it's a guessing game. Up north it's 50/50 as well, unless France can be convinced to offer a helping hand. Thus we can calculate that the current expected gain of the Turko-Russian alliance is roughly 0.5 SCs from the south (as Turkey has to outguess Italy to not lose Tunis/Greece back to Italy) and 0.5 from the north (as Russia might take either of the northern Austrian home SCs), for a total expected value of one full SC. The value of a French support here would be 0.5 SCs and a certain ill-defined diplomatic rider: if France publicly commits to supporting Vienna, then Turkey will know that Russia won't gain a build this year, and therefore he'll have an easier time playing eg. Bul-Sev.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309150/#Comment_309150" name="Item_536" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-22T17:46:44+00:00" title="January 22, 2011  5:46PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Daniel, it seems we have an opportunity for a peace plan here. Consider: Berlin is lost to you, and I can't retake Belgium, which means that we're in the initially considered peace plan positions in Germany anyway. The naval situation is sufficiently credible that I think you can be convinced about me being convinced about your ability to defend yourself, if you follow - it's not realistic for me to pursue an anti-French strategy here, at least not without major tactical upsets.<br/><br/>By making a quick turn-about we will gain many benefits, perhaps the most important of them being your ability to support our Austro-Italian brethren against the imminent disaster coming out of the east; your Tyrolian army is already in position (as is your Berlin army in its way), and it is no trouble for you to move one of your fleets back to Wes to support Italy; perhaps you could have Tunis as your reward, even, if you move before the naval situation breaks apart one way or the other there. It seems to me that tactically your participation at this juncture might be crucial to the balance of the eastern Powers; by participating constructively there you'll play time for both of us to gear up for some serious operations in the area.<br/><br/>We can, I'm sure, work out a rational fleet positioning and disarmament plan at leisure. I might have perhaps one fleet too many here for a comfortable eastern campaign, but those can be removed if the will is there - move to Picardy and force a retreat from there, stuff like that. There aren't any trust issues that I can see here, either - the fact remains that our ability to project force against one another is rather round-about.<br/><br/>(It goes without saying that following this plan seriously will necessarily result in the game moving towards some sort of Anglo-Franco-somethingsomething draw. This is a honourable ending for the game, and I'm sure you know that I'm not one to refuse a good draw when soloing proves impossible. I find it unlikely that you would disagree with me if I say that neither of us can be played off the board from these middle-game positions; I know that I'd be confident in my ability to share in a victory were I playing France at the moment.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309151/#Comment_309151" name="Item_537" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-22T18:26:44+00:00" title="January 22, 2011  6:26PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was kicking myself allday over the mis-click, and what's worse, I had to go to work right away, so I couldn't formulate a post more than four letters long.<br/><br/>Bill &amp; Daniel<br/><br/>Let's soldier on ahead- supposing you both support me into Vienna in the fall, next year we can support Austria into Trieste, and then France into Venice.

The three-way draw happens when all three sides agree that none of them can force a solo against the other two, and the four-way draw happens when all four agree that they cannot eliminate one of their number without destabilising the board to tip for a solo for one of them, and a five or six way draw results when they don't have enough intestinal fortitude to play real Diplomacy.  The two-way draw, as Eero points out, is theoretically possible, but a 17-17 balance of the board is incredibly precarious- I happen to agree with him that it's in practice a non-reality.<br/><br/>Ensuring one's place in the endgame is typically done by securing a stalemate line: a position that can be held against any assault.  Due to the invulnerability of Switzerland, the traditional stalemate line runs from the Southwest to the Northeast corner of the map.  There are essentially three key areas: Gibraltar, the German Homeland, and St. Petersburg.<br/><br/>Going around Gibraltar can be done though MAO, or Spain itself.  F NOA S F MAO, F MAO S F Spa, A Por S Spa, A Gas S Mar, F Spa S Mar can hold out forever against any Eastern attack.  Likewise, Bur/Ruh/Kie and St.P + another unit can form an unstoppable line.<br/><br/>The key in these situations is that they are invulnerable- from one side.  Getting a unit past the stalemate line, such as an Italian army in mainland France, or a Turkish or Italian fleet past MAO means that 1) some of those supports can be cut and 2) those units might have to do things other than support in place.<br/><br/>Also, really, if France and England were going to partner with a third nation, it wouldn't have to be Turkey- just whoever's left.  Turkey has an ideal position as a corner power to be in that position, but a triumphant Italy or Russia (for example) could just as easily partner with the last two units.<br/><br/>Finally, it's my opinion that it's far too early to be discussing a three-way draw: none of the powers have eclipsed 10 centers, and we still have all 7 players technically in the game.  E/F is by no means decided- France could land a raider fleet in Clyde, England stands to take Berlin, hold the Channel, and threaten convoys.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309238/#Comment_309238" name="Item_548" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-23T14:42:30+00:00" title="January 23, 2011  2:42PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Assuming that predictions of a possible three-way draw between England, France, and Turkey are correctly founded, what would the three of us need to do in order to stay in the game?</blockquote>\nWillow's summary of the draw issues is good, I like. It's true that a French/English draw pattern does not entail Turkey, it's just a very natural outcome. Assuming a long-term play situation where the eastern triangle remains relatively paralyzed, while the west starts projecting force to the east in an extremely dynamic manner, the practical losses caused by the western assault would mostly be suffered by Italy and Russia as the west-most eastern Powers. Turkey, on the other hand, would be in prime position to exploit their difficulties, forcing its neighbours to fight a two-front war. It is possible (likely?) that Turkey would not make as much of a gain in Italy and Russia as the western Powers when those worthies fall, but it wouldn't have to: the end-game logic dictates that a third Power, no matter how puny, still has as much of a chance of participating in the draw as either of the other two. Really, the only issues Turkey would have in a large-scale western assault would be if it itself had a shot at a solo victory (and thus no wish to move onto the end-game yet), or if it perceived one of the westerners to be so superior that it threatened to solo in the end-game process. Aside from those concerns Turkey is in the position that is very typical for a corner Power: hooray for anybody else who wants to fight him into a solid victory, he'll be happy to join the aggressors in the winner's table.<br/><br/>The correct Italian play for preventing this particular future, assuming that it is found credible by the Italian leadership, would be to send a small (one-unit, in practice) foray into the French lands to tip the balance ever so slightly - probably not even claim a SC, as the point would merely be in forcing France to divide its attention just enough to cause the French and English players to think that England has a shot at overcoming France, after all. This would then directly send the Anglo-French relations into another plummet that would likely take 2-3 years to sort out, thus giving the easterners more time to resolve their own differences without western interference. This same sort of logic could theoretically work for Russia as well, except perhaps that the distances are greater and at least to me it seems that England is more fragile due to the lack of depth in the defense: it would take great skill to force England to detach forces to the east without also risking a total overrun by the French as things currently stand. (The exact causes are boring, it's to do with the distance from English force concentrations to StP versus French forces to Marseilles.)<br/><br/>Speculation all, of course, mostly for Paul's benefit and academic interest. We're still solidly in the middle-game here, and will be as long as we so dictate with Daniel <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309242/#Comment_309242" name="Item_549" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-23T15:38:44+00:00" title="January 23, 2011  3:38PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting, thank you!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calculus" title="Calculus"><img alt="Calculus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calculus">Calculus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309248/#Comment_309248" name="Item_550" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-23T17:09:30+00:00" title="January 23, 2011  5:09PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 23, 2011 5:18PM by Calculus.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, yes at the last minute I changed my orders and moved there - I figured we'd have an unagranged bounce.

No need to respond and thus tell the others what to decide, but I hope you'll think about it!<br/><br/><br/>Bill,<br/><br/>It's not too easy for me to judge your intentions at this point, and you do have a history of attacking me. But I'm going to trust that throwing yourself my way at this point is more or less suicidal, especially if you know that I intend to support you (whereas, given the chaos of public negotiation, making an enemy of me, and thus everyone around you, could see both of your armies "accidentally" disbanded depending on what we all choose to do on any given turn). If you'd like to send me a message, I'm sure you can figure out how.<br/><br/>I would like to see you support me back into Greece (since Daumantas appears to be unwilling to make the trade) or attack Bulgaria, roll a die. <br/><br/>Eero's suggestion of, e.g., an attack on Rumania are also interesting. It would be possible for me to cover such an attack with an arranged, assuring that you gain a territory and are able to build immediately.<br/><br/>I am willing to coordinate further support of your forces from my end, or take a guess, as you prefer.

Otherwise I'll end up in some sort of Turko-Russian three-way draw as the game spins down. I dearly hope that Bill has some amazing plan here. Maybe he's thinking that he can paralyze the Balkans by playing Russia and Turkey against each other, considering that neither should wish for the other to just walk into the Austrian SCs.<br><br>My suggestion to Italy here is that you'll probably have to abandon the Austrian mainland - put the fleet in Adr, remove A Vie, convoy A Alb to Venice in the spring, and huddle down, supporting Austria in place in Trieste in the fall. (He foolishly betrayed you, but any number of betrayals won't change the fact that your destinies are somewhat inseparable here.) The Austrian is too unreliable as an ally, and the situation is tactically too risky; better to clean out and straighten your defensive line where you can hold it credibly with your own strength, as that puts pressure on the opposing alliance to reconsider their priorities. Once Russia and Turkey both see that the war over the Balkans is over and there's just mopping up left, the pressure between the two will again ratchet up: we all know that the one who moves first will ensure their place in any draw on this board (and might even have a shot at a solo), so when the mutual border stretches all the way to Trieste and it becomes obvious to Turkey how dominant Russian armies are in the Balkans against his fleets, then I'll be surprised if the alliance doesn't break down. Heck, I wouldn't keep to it at that point, I'd just put the knife to the other guy and see whether that's enough to take me all the way to victory.<br><br>Obviously this plan sucks if Turkey is committed to an end-game Juggernaut and by implication killing you no matter how long it takes; he might be, as his tactical position is now very dominant, and it's difficult for him to outright convert his fleets to a more fruitful use. Still, resisting <i>Russia</i> in this situation is only useful insofar as you might be able to keep hold of SCs able to support your position against the Turk; this is unlikely once the lines have broken down, as any armies you might manage to put into continental SCs this coming year will merely support themselves by those gains and no more. It's not a very attractive option, but if we view Turkey as your real nemesis for geopolitical reasons, then it makes sense to give way where Russia benefits to focus everything you have in making yourself hard to swallow for the Turk. The ideal outcome is that the Turk realizes that he can't take you quickly enough to matter, sues for peace and goes after the Russian before Willow leverages the Austrian gains into an unassailable position.<br/><br/>Hey Willow, while I'm here: don't build in Moscow; we both know why you might want to, but if you do, then that motivates me to step up in the environs as well - first something to support StP indefinitely (easiest stalemate line on the board, that), then a convoy at my convenience wherever. Building in Moscow would only make sense if I didn't have a spare unit for supporting StP, but it's easy to see that I do. By building in Sevastopol you'll keep the current situation where we both commit an unit to bouncing each other, which I think is a pretty nice situation for both parties.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309338/#Comment_309338" name="Item_560" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-24T11:26:35+00:00" title="January 24, 2011 11:26AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2011 11:30AM by Paul_T.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I expected to lose Trieste, but somehow I didn't realize that I could lose Trieste and Tunis at the same time. Not sure how I missed that: probably just haven't been paying enough attention to this game.<br/><br/>Bill, I don't know if you're just being vindictive (taking one territory as a way of supporting your own armies hardly seems like that terrible a betrayal, compared to how you kept Italy from gaining any SCs at all at the beginning of the game, despite my clearly sticking to our agreement - and you can see very well that without that third fleet, you would have been surrounded and cut out very, very quickly, with me no longer able to give you any support)... Anyway, but if not, I'll be really curious to hear your rationale for this particularly choice, even if you don't feel up to revealing it now. Just sometime, eventually.<br/><br/>It's lovely, for sure. In both games of Diplomacy I've tried so far, as far as I can tell, my neighbours have been turning on me to no apparent gain. Well, at least in this game I've done <i>something</i> to deserve it (although I still really can't see how not building that third fleet could have possibly ended up well for either Italy or Austria in this particular game, and so I think I made the right decision, even from an honest, allied perspective).]<br/><br/>I don't mind losing to superior tactical play (as is the case with Daumantas and Tunisia in this situation, no hard feelings there, all in good sport), even if betrayal is part of that strategy, but this situation where people work hard to undermine you despite no gain to themselves is just plain frustrating.<br/><br/>[Edit: This may be coming across as too strong. It's far worse in the other game; in this game play seems quite rational by comparison! If I'm complaining, it's more to do with the other game I'm playing.]<br/><br/><br/>Eero,<br/><br/>I appreciate the advice, and was considering that kind of thing anyway, but you've yet again overestimated Italy's actual strength in your analysis.

A large part of the negotiation process is about imposing your view of how the game goes and understanding how the others see it. No matter the quality of play, no matter the accord among the players, I've yet to play a game where players would actually agree about the simplest of things, including such matters of estimation as who's going to win a given war or who benefits due to a given trend. For all we know Bill might have decided that Austria has a better shot at survival with Italy clearly on the defensive and the Balkans split between Turkey and Russia; it's not impossible to survive such situations if you can use diplomacy to impose courses of action on the larger Powers surrounding you.<br/><br/>Also, yes - Italy's losing two units now. Probably the two outer armies, leaving one army and three fleets to work with. There's been worse, the important thing is to locally balance the opposition so as to not leave any easy choices for the enemy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309347/#Comment_309347" name="Item_562" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-24T11:58:19+00:00" title="January 24, 2011 11:58AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, quite right.<br/><br/>But some choices are less defensible than others. Bill's choices might be well-founded for a variety of reasons, that I can accept, and he's fighting for his dear life, so desperation can account for all kinds of actions. It's really more in the other game where I have seen odd behaviour, such as someone accepting to help with a unit and then not issuing any order to the unit at all, despite the fact that they would clearly could not have been any worse off if they had done *something* with it. <br/><br/>This is really not terribly relevant to this game going on here, where all the players at least seem concerned with *playing well*, to the extent that they are capable of it. It's in the other game where I have seen people do weird things without any explanation. I've seen a few players, for example, continue with a war even after it's been pointed out to them that continuing that war is not to their advantage. When asked, "If you see that's it's not a good idea to do that, why are you still doing it?" And the answer is, "Uh, yeah, I don't know. I guess it's not very rational, is it?" And then they continue with that course of action, as though they feel that they have no power to change their long-term plan despite changing circumstances.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, it's weird for me to play competitive games with people who do not appear to be playing rationally. (Again, I very much doubt that is the case in this game, no accusations here!) If it's a ploy, and there is rationale behind it, then I can understand that. But choosing to play against reason is... very bizarre.<br/><br/>This is all really sideline to this game going on here, feel free to ignore me!<br/><br/>I will keep on fighting, assuming no allies, and we will see what we will see.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309351/#Comment_309351" name="Item_563" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-24T12:18:39+00:00" title="January 24, 2011 12:18PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            He, ironically enough, Bill and I might have made great progress this next year if we had held our position, since I could retreat into the Aegean and thereby support Austria into Bulgaria and otherwise mess around with Turkish defense.

Heck, I've played something like a dozen newbie games around here over the last five years, and we've had all sorts of play ranging from diamond-hard gamesmanship to uncaring sloughing and beyond. Boardgames in general can be challenging socially when the players are mismatched in terms of seriousness, but Diplomacy tends to be even more savage in this regard: the game puts you on the spot and demands that you prove your worth by smart play and right choices, even as other players are clamoring in your ear about what those choices should be. It's not that uncommon for a casual gamer to partially shut down either intentionally or without realizing it themselves, resulting in play that seems like it protects their dignity above all; this is, I understand, a big reason for why people end up on revenge trips in Diplomacy, or latch onto an alliance as a crutch, or throw the game after a minor set-back: they're protective behaviours that help the person construct a narrative about this gaming experience they had, a narrative that avoids confronting the performance as it was - they can say that they were just playing for the larks, or that at least they didn't lie and cheat, or at least the other guy lost just as much as they did themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309361/#Comment_309361" name="Item_565" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-24T13:21:29+00:00" title="January 24, 2011  1:21PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2011 1:25PM by Bill_White.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, you want to feel put upon because I betrayed you more than you betrayed me, but that's just whining. When you re-took Trieste, you took away my prospects of participating in the draw. At that point, proper Diplomacy would have been to try to assuage my hurt feelings and assure me that, yes, of course there would be room in the draw for me; I was <i>essential</i> to the war effort; there was <i>no way</i> you'd even consider a game where I wasn't one of the winners, no matter what, as long as you had anything to do with it. You would have been lying, of course, but you would have been playing the psychological game the way you needed to. Instead, you offered rationalizations and excuses, saying that an Italian fleet was worth more to you than an Austrian army, and implying that I had no recourse because the Russians and the Turks would gobble me up. <br/><br/>My goal was simply to show you that you were wrong on both counts: (1) that Austrian army was <i>instrumental</i> to your well-being, because you needed my good will to sustain your position, and (2) everyone always has <i>some</i> recourse, even if it's suicidal. I also wanted to make sure that you understood the ultimately non-rational component of Diplomacy; evolutionary psychologists argue that human beings are wired to punish cheaters, even when it's costly to do so, because otherwise we wouldn't have morality. You have asserted that I "have a history" of attacking you, so I need to disabuse you of that misapprehension: I'm not the guy who ordered Ven-Tyr, Rom-Ven in Spring 01, and I'm not the guy who stabbed his putative ally in the back because I didn't think I could make and hold gains against my enemies. Sure, I tried to make gains against you when the situation on the board permitted, but when circumstances put us on the same team, I was on the team. I let you into Trieste the first time, for Chrissakes, because it was tactically the right thing to do. Frankly, your stab into Trieste wasn't even necessary: if you'd guessed right against Daumantas, you'd have been sitting in Tunisia and would have held on to Greece, putting you and our alliance one up.  As far as I'm concerned, I'm more sinned against than sinning.<br/><br/>At this point, Paul, you and I will both probably lose, but I can live with that, because otherwise you would have learned the wrong things from this game. Eero will probably accuse me of egregious meta-gaming, but I'm just playing the hand I'm dealt. I expect to take a beating next year.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calculus" title="Calculus"><img alt="Calculus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calculus">Calculus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309372/#Comment_309372" name="Item_566" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-24T14:47:09+00:00" title="January 24, 2011  2:47PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2011 2:52PM by Calculus.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I contacted Mel White a couple days ago about taking over France, and he's willing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm going to have to a looser and quiter.

This is actually an improvement for you, as then you'll have a very effective deterrent for the most obvious Turkish stab of all, a convoy to Sevastopol. As long as Sev is open the Turk can basically just choose his moment; he has a dominant position when he can strike a death blow at you at will. This isn't even a matter of trustworthy alliances or anything like that, it's just basic sense that he'll do it when he considers the time to be right, and you should take the first opportunity to cover yourself when it doesn't cost you in material.<br/><br/>(Incidentally, I do obviously recognize that our perennial bounce is more of a burden for you than it is for me. This has suited me fine ever since you got the Juggernaut going, as having to commit that one army has been slowing you down ever so slightly against Austria. This in turn is beneficial for us here in the west, as always - we want the eastern triangle to not get resolved before we manage to hash out our own neighbourhood. All very understandable, I'm sure, and not a sign of any particular malice towards Russia.)<br/><br/>Your analysis as to which units I would likely use in reinforcing StP is correct. Have no doubt that I would do this reinforcement, even as it does cost me a bit in tactical opportunities elsewhere; a secure Nordic zone is too valuable to lose if I have any way to prevent it. It is also true that Russia would currently benefit in a minor strategic way by discomfiting me for the exact same reasons I benefit from discomfiting Russia. However, in this case ramping up the forces on our border would also cost you, and you'd pay more than I would: you need that extra unit even more than I do if you desire to retain momentum and a capability for reaching further into new conquests. Furthermore, once I have two units committed to StP, it will be more effective in the long run for me to make sure that those units are making a profit - it'll be easy to justify adding a third, perhaps making peace with France, and then we'll be in a real war instead of a secure bounce. The StP situation is pretty easy to escalate, I'm saying, but it doesn't seem that either of us benefits from doing so at this time. Perhaps later.<br/><br/>Also, in case there is doubt - I will, of course, accept a draw with the Juggernaut if and when you crush Italy - taking down France is a natural follow-up at that point, England being as invincible as always. My earlier reference to trying to avoid this was a jocular reference to the better outcome: should the Italian defense succeed (thus slowing down the board enthropy and giving me more time to operate) and should my own play go well, I might be able to take a solo victory. Obviously enough, if this is not available, we'll talk draw. So there's no need to consider England some sort of implacable foe from the eastern viewpoint, I'm just like Turkey in that regard: if the west attacks east, Turkey is the natural draw partner, and England is the same when the shoe is on the other foot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309416/#Comment_309416" name="Item_571" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-24T20:14:59+00:00" title="January 24, 2011  8:14PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniel,<br/><br/>Sorry to hear you're leaving, but congratulations on the news, and whatever is coming next for you! Anyway, you will be missed. Glad you joined us.<br/><br/>(I'm borderline drop-out potential, too, due to real-life concerns, but I'm going to try to stick it through, see things to the bitter end. I suspect you're making the smarter decision!)<br/><br/>Bill,<br/><br/>I'm not really whining -- and if it comes across that way (which it probably does, I'll admit), it's something I regret. Should have reread my posts before submitting them!<br/><br/>Although I <i>do</i> disagree entirely with your rationale here: I would never choose lying (never mind making obvious lies) over telling as much of the honest truth as I can, and sticking to it (as I did). The order history bears me out here! Had I been the smarter player, I would have tried to grab as much of your territory as I could once you showed you weren't interested in maintaining our mutual interdependence. I don't see how telling predictable and empty lies would have changed the situation. (Would you really have responded differently? I doubt it.) <br/><br/>Granted, my attack on Trieste was based on a miscomprehension. I figured that you would somehow manage to maintain your position or gain another SC, as you had done so far. Eero had suggested my moving into Trieste the previous turn, and it seemed like you were in agreement with the plan at that time, so I was acting based on that as well. <br/><br/>I'm also not sure what "lesson" you're trying to teach me here, because I'm pretty sure I would do exactly the same thing again if a similar situation comes around. With my support from Trieste, you could have held your ground; without it, because you were losing your colony in Berlin, you would not have been able to build in Trieste anyway, and it would have left our common front against Turkey and Russia down an army. Hence I felt it best for the alliance to reinforce both fronts at once. <br/><br/>Not to mention that, had I been overrun in the Mediterranean, you would have been just as done for (if not more so). I could be wrong about all these things, as I'm not an experienced player, but that's how I saw it then and I don't really see it any differently now.<br/><br/>You've seen my orders, too: I've supported you every turn, before and after that point (and even this last turn, after you had already turned on me). <br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, my opening moves may have seemed threatening, sure (although you had agreed to let me into Trieste, so I'm not entirely sure why see armies on your border was all that frightening, unless you were already planning to back out of that plan), but you followed up with betrayal even when the following turn's orders clearly showed I'd been true to my word. Likewise for Trieste last year: if I'd been planning to take you down, I could have done that quite effectively at that point.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's all good sport in the spirit of a game; I'm not holding it as a personal issue or any sort of grudge. This is what I signed on for, and it's at least an interesting experience! I'll be curious to see how the rest of this game goes down, especially once France is run by a different player (which, as France is my only ally, might be certainly shorten my participation in the game).<br/><br/>I'm not continuing this in order to argue. That would be quite pointless here! As Eero says, in this game it makes most sense to agree to disagree: our views on the game are clearly different, and that's to be expected. In many ways, that's what this game's about. Rather, I'm really just responding to say: I hear you, but I don't agree. (Then again, maybe you're painting a certain picture for the sake of Diplomacy, rather than for the sake of truthfulness: and that's fine, too! We all have our own ways of playing this sucker.)<br/><br/>However, if you do feel that I'm making some basic misunderstanding of how Diplomacy is best played (as you imply above), I'd love to hear about it in a more neutral context.<br/><br/>Game on!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309460/#Comment_309460" name="Item_572" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T04:53:43+00:00" title="January 25, 2011  4:53AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh!

Can't push inland to Russia with fleets, can't easily move his second army (doesn't matter all that much even if he would, I'd think), can't negotiate peace with France at a moment's notice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, I'd probably like a French endgame than an English one - France isn't as untouchable to Turkey as England would be.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, of course, I would certainly like another pathway for you to open up that isn't turkey-wards...

I can't believe that you're actually chiding me for <i>ingratitude</i> for taking one of my SCs away from me because you were getting outfought by Turkey. From my perspective, you were shoring up your own position at my expense, plain and simple, and then expecting me to smile and say I liked it. Fuck that noise. If you didn't have the stones to fight your own goddamn war and win it, then sneaking in to my city to make sure that you didn't disband and then expecting me to soldier on as if nothing had happened is just bad play. Don't get me wrong: taking Trieste was a <i>good stab</i>. But it was a <i>bad alliance move</i>. And you knew that it was a bad alliance move, regardless of your disingenuous pleas to the contrary, because <i>you didn't warn me</i>, or discuss it--you just did it. Having done it, you need to be prepared to live with the consequences.<br><br>Now, I'm honestly not all that worked up about it. I enjoy the psychological and emotional part of the game--the uncertainty, the treachery, the fear. It's true that I would have lasted longer in the game by sucking it up and fighting on in the line in the Balkans, but what Eero says about narratives is true. I'd even say it goes further than that: it's <i>all</i> narratives--the only thing you take away from the game is the narrative of your participation in it. Now, some narratives are more technically grounded than others, but even Eero's highly technical understanding of the game is mixed in with curious notions of machismo and intellectual worthiness. Ultimately, what that means is that I can play any way I want, and so can you, even if we're both kidding ourselves. <br><br>-- Bill                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309494/#Comment_309494" name="Item_574" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T08:16:15+00:00" title="January 25, 2011  8:16AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill,<br><br>Agreed!

It doesn't help that the year in question was one where we hardly communicated: I remember waiting for a reply from you, and deciding to hedge my bets rather than risk ruin. I was fully expecting you to turn back my way at any moment at the time, so I was trying to play it safe and hoped you would play on towards your own survival rather than vindication.

If you're interested, Paul, we can talk about the play-through after the game; I think that's where your problem lies, as these openings are not weak. Probably the core issue is the open diplomacy environment, it changes the diplomatic land-scape in rather weird ways. Also, Daumantas is cunning like a diseased prairie dog after this series of SG Diplomacy games, so it's not really a wonder that he's leading the dance in the Med.

Here's the situation: I have a too fleet-heavy force and you have an extra fleet flagrantly in English space after a long dance that we started with Daniel ten years back, so it'll take some work to sort out the situation. However, sort it we must, for as the situation stands, England is virtually impregnable, and France is not realistically going to face critical losses, either. Neither of those are quite absolute, but it's a given that I currently hold a slight tactical edge, and substantial losses to either party will only come about due to tactical luck or a long, awkward war that takes too much time considering the eastern situation.<br><br>This being the case, we need bold new initiatives to get ourselves in gear against the east! I suggest that the peace settlement outlined by the ancient regime is essentially valid: I keep the coastal German provinces, including Holland, while you keep Munich and Belgium (over which we might struggle a bit, but which you'll be able to keep if you focus on it). You retreat to MAO and Brest, I retreat from the Irish Sea, leaving only the English Channel occupied. I get my army out of France.<br><br>It takes concrete will at this point to realize the above settlement, but the alternative is that we fight against each other while the Juggernaut finishes Austria and Italy. This is not a deal-breaker for me, I can go with that play, as it happens to be the case that Russia will not be realistically able to challenge me up north, and therefore any real assault on the west will come continentally and over the Mediterranean, overrunning your core positions long before I will be seriously threatened. As described earlier in the discussion, the default outcome of us continuing to fight is that Turkey and Russia come knocking on <i>your</i> back-door. Therefore it only makes sense for you to continue the war against me for two reasons: either you have to think that I'll overrun you immediately if you do not defend aggressively, or you have to think that you can actually overcome me before the Berber pirates get into Spain. My own tactical estimate on both of these points is negative - perhaps you'll agree?<br><br>Speaking tactically for a moment, notice how well your eastern army group lines up with the Italian defense if you'll accept for the moment that Berlin's going to belong to me: you'll find it easy to join Italy in holding the Ven-Tyr-Boh area against Russia with A Mun and A Pru, even pushing back the assault; I have no doubt that Italy and the Austrian remnant will be happy to reward your efforts with gains in those wild Balkans fleshpots where every Power can carve out their piece. This opportunity to stymie the Juggernaut comes pretty cheap, it seems to me - the marginal utility of those two units against me is in making some futile assaults on Berlin or bouncing me in Kiel, neither of which is going to amount to much in comparison, especially as I'll be defending against those moves whether you're making them or not. Might as well seek new directions and find out whether you might replace Austria as Italy's partner against the east. I'm sure that Paul will be happy to develop this train of thought further considering his desperate position and the imminent dominance of the Juggernaut alliance.<br/><br/>Obviously enough my army in Piedmont is both a great motivator in these peace talks as well as their main problem. If you're interested in peace, we can figure out a suitably spectacular means of getting rid of the army; simply convoying it back to England seems unlikely, I confess, but it's also an entirely serious option if we're really wanting to have a peace here. Depending on the Russian moves it might make sense for me to convoy the army directly to Norway, too.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309510/#Comment_309510" name="Item_579" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T09:48:13+00:00" title="January 25, 2011  9:48AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, it's somewhat less true now, but England has all the time in the world with the position it has carved out for itself -- something you point out rather gleefully from time to time, actually!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not so much that France isn;t bigger and badder, it's more that steps can be taken to stop her and push her back if it comes to it... Significantly less so in the case of England, which can go in bursts of stalemate line after stalemate line...

Why put more strain on your Austrian relationship while simultaneously giving up a raid on Turkey (which may or may not be fruitful, but definitelly ties up two of my units at least)? Unless... Hee! That's neat. And effective, quite possibly! Ignores control of Tyrolia, perhaps, but neat.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan't promise you hard security, Paul - any common moveset we have will have you open up to me somewhat. Best I could do is promise, say, a year of non-aggression assuming a similar commitment at your part, as well as a common moveset toward Iberia. Not the best thing ever, sure. In all honesty, I am currently trying to keep the diplomatic channel open, so to speak, rather than engaging in long-term alliance building. We don't have much common interests in this situation, but, well, situations change, and I wouldn't like you to think that I have some deep personal purpose in seeking Italy's downfall.

The attraction of French cities must be there--I feel it, too!  The beaches, the cafes, the girls, ooh la la, as we say.  But certainly your attention is better spent on the exotic spices to the east, if you know what I mean.  The extra forces you will soon have will assist you in your current war, and would be misused starting a new one.  <br><br>Eero,<br>While I appreciate the implicit offer of the British Expeditionary Force in defending Paris against Germany, I must decline.  French pride prohibits accepting such aid.  Feel free to withdraw your force with the same speed and audacity that marked its arrival.  <br>To a large extent, the French naval presence in the North Atlantic was borne of a desire to show it could be done.  Having done it, we can now look for other challenges in other directions.  There really is not much up there.  <br><br>Peter,<br>As the saying goes, 'try, try again'.  Anything is possible.  <br/><br/>Willow,<br/>I am sure you will agree that having French and British armies on your borders is disconcerting.  You almost have to build that Army in Moscow now, I would think.  <br/><br/>Daumantas,<br/>I am impressed by your recovery and handling of the early Russian attack on Turkey.  It's good that you are keeping a close watch on your erstwhile enemy.  It is true chivalry for you to hold open the door to the Balkans for Willow, holding off the Italian fleets while the inexorable Russian movement into the Balkans continues.  Luckily, there are a few centers in coastal areas, so perhaps you can maintain growth with Russia.  <br/><br/>Bill,<br/>My Austrian brother!  I enjoy the narrative you're writing--plucky Austrian defenders, beset on all sides, valiant to the end.  We'll see how well we can extend the ending.

From the fall onwards, that is. We both have sufficient fleets for a persistent bounce, and that'll be easier for the people of London to stomach. Perhaps start with a supported bounce (two units each) and then scale back once the intentions have been affirmed. Another approach would be for you to support yourself into the Channel in the fall forcibly so as to help me rebuild the unit as an army; building in London would help me make sure that there's no temptation for you to stay in the Channel - a retreat in the spring of 1912 would then leave the Channel empty altogether and me with an extra army to use in the east.<br/><br/>As you say, though, this is all predicated on the spring disarmament being successful; messing about with the disposition of the Channel would be the death of me as long as that NAO fleet remains. You retreat south, I retreat to Denmark, everybody is happy and the west does not fall prey to Turkish hordes.<br/><br/>Regarding Belgium, that being the actual substantial issue if we set aside that expeditionary army in Picardy - I'm willing to keep my fingers out of the place this year provided you do not offer succour to the German trump government in Holland; I get Holland and you keep Belgium. If the Channel maneuvers go well I won't be in position to threaten the place too badly afterwards, although I'd like to discuss a trade for the place later; I'll help you get another SC somewhere and you give me Belgium, thus enabling us to have a complete separation of interests in western Europe. But that's a concern for later on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309749/#Comment_309749" name="Item_593" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-26T11:23:42+00:00" title="January 26, 2011 11:23AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 26, 2011 11:24AM by DWeird.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Willows...<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, you could have taken into account that *I* am not trusting at all! Instead of happily skipping about on the road to further growth, I now have to worry about my ally slipping into the back the second I suffer a setback on another front? What the hell? You tell an ally about this sort of thing *before* you punch the orders in, not after. Geez.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess this could be just a result of a naturally growing mutual mistrust now that a common external threat is gone and we are both free to consider other options. It's still more useful for both of us to keep to this alliance rather than break it, so that's exactly what I'm planning to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I don't feel the need to hide that what you did and the way you did it - without prior consultation or warning, with no obvious need for secrecy in sight - makes me feel angry and frustrated.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd edgy. I also want to make clear that, while I value the alliance, I don't particularly want to end up the one footing the bill. An army in Sevastopol is exactly as much as I'm willing to take. Anything more - the obvious army movement, wrong orders (be sure to double check!), and I'm done.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here is us, on the raggedy edge. Don't push me, and I won't push you.<br/>\n(One does not always get to end a missive with a Firefly quote!)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and as an extra request... It dawns to me that part of the tension could be relieved if we divulged our long-ish-term plans to each other. That way, we can exchange "You lying cheating bastard! That's HARMFUL to me! How dare you not think of that!" for "Hey, are you doing what you said you'd be doing? Doesn't at all look like it!"<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my own case, I am basically planning to crunch down on Italy and then, depending on what the situation on the board is, either send out lone raiders and build up a long chain of convoys, solidifying control of the Med, or prop up a solid defense line against whatever incursion comes my way. There's also a plan in case of Russian attack, which involves... Supporting the italian/austrian armies, hunkering down in the turkish mainland, and waiting for Eero to wade in once your back is turned.<br/>\n<br/>\nSound reasonable?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAside:<br/>\n<br/>\nHeh! If France sorts out the situation with Eero, one way or another, she will be sending a fleet italianwards indeed. Sure, there's some goodwill between - neither side has really made any 'sudden moves' so to speak. But personally, I don't see the current situation as anything more than a mutual "more important things to deal with." Once that's no longer true...<br/>\n<br/>\nDoesn't mean France won't help out in various italian struggles until England's done with, one way or another, though... S'called keeping your meal fresh.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309757/#Comment_309757" name="Item_594" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-26T12:04:00+00:00" title="January 26, 2011 12:04PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Insofar as it matters, I agree with Daumantas to a degree about the Franco-Italian relations in this board set-up; obviously enough France wouldn't mind if it could bowl Italy over. However, the situation is also analogous to the one Italy has in the early game with Austria: your primary victim is also your best protection against the Turko-Russian threat. Attacking your buffer state is tricky in this game because much of the defensive effectiveness of a given front comes from the cohesion of action among the participating forces; an attack to the back has to go perfectly, or otherwise it merely causes the fall of your buffer state that allows the opposition on the other side to push through, resulting in a roughly even split on the buffer. Thus it's only smart to attack your buffer state if the situation is so reduced that you can basically just slip in your own troops in lieu of the buffer's, or when you're basically fine with splitting the buffer state's possessions with the guy on the other side. Famously the Italo-Austrian conundrum on the Calhamer board is that even as decades of play have favoured early stabs between them, Italy actually has <i>two</i> strong Powers waiting for their opportunity east of Austria - who's going to benefit in that situation if Austria crumbles?<br><br>Comparing to the analogue, the French situation in Italy is not quite as grim, as France only needs to handle Turkey as competition when it comes to splitting Italy. For example, if France can slip three fleets to the Med and get one of them to the Tyrhenian Sea, I'd say that the tactical realities are pretty favourable for France, assuming he can make the stab thorough enough to not leave a couple of Italian fleets floating about; the Tyrhenian position backed by sufficient fleets provides strong claims on Tunis and Rome, as well as an equal claim on Naples, which is already slightly more than half of the entire Italian sphere of things. Venice might of course be contested with armies at the same time, so overall it's not at all impossible for France to consider a savage split of Italy followed immediately by a trench war with Turkey coming from the other side. It's not like Turkey alone is any more overwhelming than France, so it's possible for the latter to think that they'll gain the upper hand by betraying Italy.<br><br>On the other hand, reducing Powers is always risky business strategically in that it reduces the options and brings the game closer to the finish line. There is always a price when you go from possibilities to realities, in other words. In this case the concrete dynamic consequence is that if France attacks Italy, then he's basically admitting that he's not going to remove England and make a solo out of the game; without Italy in the middle the Turkish pressure will become a constant as both sides pile up their fleets on the Tyr-Ion area, which will tie up the French forces and basically become an end-game position. The favourable part is that France with Italian possessions and a strong position in continental Europe is a shoo-in as a draw partner, while the negative part is that France might or might not want to keep the game in the middle-game phase to seek for soloing openings.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309819/#Comment_309819" name="Item_595" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-26T19:48:57+00:00" title="January 26, 2011  7:48PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daumantas-<br><br>You're right, I should have notified you- one of the challenges for me in this game is knowing how much to say- too little, and you leave your allies in the dark, too much, and your enemies can establish a perfect defense.

In short, I've had a "no PBP except for rare exception" policy from the beginning, and in fact shut others down from playtesting PBP stuff actively here. I think the first game got a pass due to it being a hot conversation piece at the time, and basically from time to time I meant to stop by (like game 3, game 5, etc) and say "this is the last one, folks!" but forgot until now.<br><br>It's a teensy distracting, these huge super-active threads. Also, I've been seeing spikes in the DB grinding recently: Most of it was due to Game Chef activity, but I'm trying to keep performance up etc.<br><br>Anyway, for this game: <b>Please carry it out in its entirety here, no problem with this one</b>. But let's make it the last one for now.<br><br>Looks like Snail's Pace ( <a href="http://snailspace.forgreatjustice.net/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://snailspace.forgreatjustice.net/</a> ) is perfect for this sort of thing, and also RPGNet has a PBP forum as well. Keep it up and going and all, just on a forum more geared for PBP stuff.<br><br>Thanks guys. If I ever move over towards a more traditional/vBulletin-style forum replacement for S-G, PBP may one day return, but in its current form the community can't handle the load.<br/><br/>Thanks! And I apologize for nor mentioning it sooner. Again, I was trying to catch y'all during a downtime between games to say it, but often the next game would start up before I could catch it.

lives. I guess it was just our thing, then. How embarrassing, I never would've opted for this course had I known that you were serious.<br/><br/>Also, Austria and Italy totally need to get back to cooperating. The positions are consistently such that they could get more out of them by playing together rather than against each other. Perhaps the French intervention force can turn things around.<br/><br/>It occurs to me that the Russian army in Warsaw is boned unless Willow attacks War-Sil to bounce Sil-War. However, this has a good chance of leaving Vienna in Italian hands for one more year. Most tricky, Mel just about single-handedly brought the eastern situation much closer to an equilibrium. Heck, there's nothing for the Turk to do about Tunis, either. Italy, Austria and France could fuck up the Turk beyond recognition by forcing both Tunis and Ionia at the same time, in fact, by cutting Alb-Gre on the fall move, although that'd probably be too much of a tactical sacrifice elsewhere.<br/><br/>Oh, oh! I almost missed the Russian "misorder". Just adorable!

Aside from that it's an excellent move, of course; note how Italy doesn't need to fear that Austria stabs and goes to Venice, as protecting Venice would have a heavy opportunity cost for Italy, ranging from not claiming Trieste (Tri-Ven that goes through) to taking the fleet out of the Mediterranean war just to cover Venice. Unless Italy is totally certain that Austria's going for a vicious stab, it's not worth it to cover Venice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309888/#Comment_309888" name="Item_605" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-27T10:35:01+00:00" title="January 27, 2011 10:35AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy,<br>Being the one who started this game and thread I appreciate your patience and will take future games elsewhere!<br>Mel                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309893/#Comment_309893" name="Item_606" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-27T10:46:12+00:00" title="January 27, 2011 10:46AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite> Damn Mel, I totally misread you here - I thought you'd continue Daniel's regime of chatting amiably while we fight for our lives.

It is well known in Diplomacy circles that France-Italian combinations are the dominant duopoly in Story Game League games.  <br/>Second, you need to prevent further Russian expansion.  The problem with continued entreaties (in an open diplomatic environment) to all parties seeking suggestions on how to work together means its hard for anyone to trust you,  Ambiguity is ok.  Lack of trust is not.  <br/>Third, you must begin to roll back Turkey.  You can start now with Tunis and the Ionian.  Sure, it's likely that Turkey and Russia will come to some kind of accord in the face of broad pressure. But they hate each other, and don't trust each other.  Nor should they, considering how each has betrayed the other time and time again. It is the nature of the geography.

I think I remember something about it being a ploy, but I'm not 100% convinced. Difficult to deal with, anyway, as my first instinct with a broken player is to get all empathetic and console the poor guy.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, the choice of dealing with Austria or not basically amounts to the danger of a stab vs. giving the enemy a two-unit advantage. Such an advantage is pretty decisive, but the stab might be even worse, potentially. Difficult to say off-hand. Perhaps the critical issue is how you see the board dynamics on a 3-4 year time-scale: if your counter-offense stalls due to not being able to cooperate with Austria, are there any trends on the board that will shift the situation to your advantage in the future? If nothing is going to save you, then you have to work with Austria simply because without him your counter-offense is a pipe-dream - Russia'll start besieging Venice long before your naval force can start making gains against Turkey.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309927/#Comment_309927" name="Item_622" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-27T12:36:04+00:00" title="January 27, 2011 12:36PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree, Eero!<br/><br/>But I could go all madman myself instead, couldn't I?

At that point, I can order Tyr-Mun, Tyr-Ven, Tyr-Tri, or Tyr-Vie. Tyr-Mun probably bounces, since Russia and France are eying each other up over it. Tyr-Ven potentially bounces vs. Tri-Ven, and makes me look like an idiot. Tyr-Tri similarly potentially bounces, and also possibly cuts Tri S Ser or Tri S Ser-Bud, also making me look like an idiot. So all that's left is Tyr-Vie. <br/><br/>Consider Russia's options. She can take Serbia with Bud-Ser, Rum S Bud-Ser or vice versa, but doing so leaves a hole in her lines, so she probably won't unless she really trusts Turkey or really thinks she's going to lose Warsaw and is willing to antagonize Turkey even more than she has already. She can support Boh-Vie with Bud, but she has to expect an attack from Serbia, so she could order Boh S Bud-Vie, not expecting anyone to want to attack Boh. But that leaves Bud open unless she slides Rum-Bud, expecting to bounce in Bud with army Serbia.<br/><br/>In any case, Army Trieste is dispositive. Tri S Tyr-Vie either bounces with Bud-Vie or wins against Boh-Vie. Tri S Ser-Bud puts Austria in Budapest unless Rum S Bud, and potentially causes Tyr-Vie to bounce with Boh-Vie. <br/><br/>So, the worst thing I can do leaves you no worse than you were before, while the best thing (from your perspective) puts you +1. So it seems like a reasonable gamble for you, from my perspective.<br/><br/>From my perspective, I'm just looking to end the year with 1 SC instead of no SCs, so I'm not in a position to be playing any cute tricks anymore.<br/><br/>-- Bill                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309979/#Comment_309979" name="Item_625" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-27T18:32:15+00:00" title="January 27, 2011  6:32PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill-<br/><br/>If you move to Tyrolia, I am willing to commit to ordering Boh S Tyr-Mun: for France to stop the attack, he'd have to give up an opportunity to attack Warsaw, which is just as well for me.<br/><br/>-Willow                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309980/#Comment_309980" name="Item_626" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-27T18:33:54+00:00" title="January 27, 2011  6:33PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DWeird</cite>Willows,<br/><br/>A shameful display.</blockquote>\nNot quite as shameful as my Spring '10 misorder, but I have to quite agree.

Consider though what use France could be to you if England continues its aggression on French soil.  In this critical moment. weakening France simply strengthens your great enemy, England.  The loss of Warsaw, which you were prepared to sacrifice earlier, plus French retention of Munich, simply ensures that England will not be able to roll over France in its continued conquest of the continent.  Should English attacks continue, you can be sure France will be willing to sue for peace, at generous terms.  Allied French armies in the vicinity of St Petersberg must certainly be an attractive feature for you.  Weaken France and those armies go away.  <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310043/#Comment_310043" name="Item_629" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-28T08:14:58+00:00" title="January 28, 2011  8:14AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Willow</cite>Bill-<br/><br/>If you move to Tyrolia, I am willing to commit to ordering Boh S Tyr-Mun: for France to stop the attack, he'd have to give up an opportunity to attack Warsaw, which is just as well for me.<br/><br/>-Willow</blockquote>\nBill,<br/>What of the narrative?

For the game to reach a conclusion, some countries must be eliminated.  The best time and best way to do that is when allies are certain.

Russia has to worry about losing Warsaw (and if Warsaw falls, Eero and Mel might make common cause over Moscow).<br/><br/>Turkey doesn't have the leverage to attack your territory unless you decide to stab me in Italy, because then I'd have to disband and Daumantas can get through into the Adriatic--then you're done, I'm pretty sure. <br/><br/>Overall, I think there's a good chance that Turk/Russian pressure on your "area" could really diminish in the coming year or two, and if you're ready and in position to take advantage of it, you could reclaim your former strength.<br/><br/>I hope you'll consider this course of action: I'm willing to support you, but at the moment I'm still looking to balance helping you with some set of orders that prevents various possible ways you could try to screw me over (after all that "I'll teach you a lesson!" talk, earlier). That's not exactly 100% efficient, as far as our cause (survival) is concerned: if you show you're willing to work with me, I think we could get establish something a little more lasting.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend the attack on Munich, personally: how are you going to do anything useful with both your armies so far apart? You'd be reliant on other people's support to accomplish anything, and that's sometimes... unreliable in this open negotiation climate.<br/><br/>Mel,<br/><br/>You have my support for Tunis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310061/#Comment_310061" name="Item_632" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-28T09:51:09+00:00" title="January 28, 2011  9:51AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul --<br/><br/>I've retreated to Albania with the intent of defending Serbia.

However, if Italy attacks with French support, then Turkey cannot deny the attack, assuming Naples cuts Ionian. Now, in this situation the Sultan should be all but certain that you won't be playing Tyr-Tun, as France is under a lot of pressure and probably won't be supporting you right now, as  he has his own problems to consider and anything that doesn't net him SCs is not worthwhile for him. Therefore Turkey will either play Ion-Tyr, Tun S Ion-Tyr, or potentially something completely unrelated such as Ion S Gre-Alb (thinking that you can't get a quorum with the Frenchman about Tunis anyway). This all makes your chances of success in capturing Tunis rather dim, and I don't quite understand what Mel's playing at with you - it'd be good for him to take the place, but even trying to do it has a bad expected value for him when it's so likely that Turkey will play a counter-move; thus his best play is to ignore the whole situation, which makes talking you into supporting him useless for anything but confusing you into playing some suboptimal moves.<br><br>Alternatively, France is naive and really wants to try a simple Wes-Tun. Who knows. Either way, I recommend that you not count on a miracle French rescue at this point; rather, try to outguess the Turk - ideally you could push your Naples fleet to the Ionian at some point, as that's the only credible three-fleet position for you to hold and develop once you achieve it. Be patient and don't let either your naval position or the Austrian Balkans position crumble quickly, and often enough your opponent makes the mistakes for you.<br><br>Clever insight about the pre-deadline communications, by the way; risky, though, as the most serious players will likely be watching the communications before the deadline.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310134/#Comment_310134" name="Item_639" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-29T08:53:51+00:00" title="January 29, 2011  8:53AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2011 8:56AM by Mel_White.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fall 1911, prior to retreats<br><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-small-23527-21-R.png"/> </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310135/#Comment_310135" name="Item_640" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-29T09:50:30+00:00" title="January 29, 2011  9:50AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A bad start for the new France.

The current Turkish force is sufficient for a stabbing attack despite the Russian home guard in Sevastopol, but only if the assault can come as a surprise; if Russia is ready, Turkey doesn't really have a very attractive war at hand, except perhaps in mid-length projection - Turkey could support Austria and Italian forces in a land war in Vienna and Budapest easily enough, as those positions are much more critical for the westerners than the Turkish land holdings, which could in 2-3 years result in Russia slowly buckling under the overpowering enemy force.<br><br>On the other hand, assuming that the two can continue cooperating (a view that I personally doubt, but that surely will have to be the official truth now more than ever), the Russian position on the Balkans is now absolutely dominant as the Czarinna reaches the coveted Rum-Bud-Vie front-line; this position is easy to use both for advancing the Turk quickly through Serbia and Trieste as well as advancing Russia's own forces, at least if additional armies can be brought to bear. As the tactical situation stands, Russia needs a fourth army for the frontlines if she is to make a smart advance into eg. Trieste; it remains to be seen if she can spare one. Meanwhile the Turk is relatively stuck and dependant on Russian largesse - an assault on Serbia won't succeed without Russian aid, and Paul has proven a conscientious defender in Italy, belying any hopes of quick naval victory. Overall very interesting times for the Juggernaut as Russia is clearly the more vulnerable of the two in a surprise attack situation while Turkey is near completely dependent on the Czarinna for any progress he might hope to make!<br><br/>The Austrian situation is grim, but Serbia is a good position to wait for an opportunity: all three Powers surrounding the position have certain motivation for keeping the place out of enemy hands, and only Russia has a force that can actually make a supported attack without foreign support - and even that requires nigh-suicidal over-extension of the Russian line, so it's not likely to happen on the spring move. Austria is, I think, in a fine position to wait out the current troop congestion on the Balkans; once any of the external flanks of the Italo-Russo-Turkish trio erupts with new disturbances and forces start moving towards more critical positions, the Serbian army might conseivably make a comeback. Even in my typical optimism regarding the chances of minor Powers I do have to admit that the open diplomacy environment does make for an awful handicap for the small fish; were I playing the Austrian position in a normal game I would have no hesitation about arranging for a fall attack on Budapest or Trieste (against the stronger Power, obviously) with appropriate support from the other party, but this is of course much more difficult to achieve in an open environment. From the Austrian viewpoint the ideal year 1912 will be such that the neighbours of Serbia make offers and unilaterally commit to supporting Serbian movements so that he can make a supported maneuver without having to reveal his intentions in advance.<br/><br/>The Italian situation is clearing up consistently, which might or might not be to Paul's advantage: with Austria weakening and the Balkans falling to Italy, Russia and Turkey the natural moment for a Turko-Russian stab approaches rapidly. However, if the stab doesn't come and the two decide to kill off Italy instead in preparation for facing the west, then Italy's in deep trouble with the Russian armies that are beginning to be in positions that enable them to project force against Trieste and Venice. The continental front is clearly on the defense, so Italy needs to move fast: if France supports Italy into Tunisia in 1912 and Italy manages to keep hold of Trieste, then the position is still mid-term defensible, thus putting pressure on the Turko-Russian alliance. On the other hand, if Italy fails to make gains this coming year and the Turko-Russian war does not begin, then it might be that we've seen the last viable Italian position as a Great Power.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310172/#Comment_310172" name="Item_643" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-29T19:45:57+00:00" title="January 29, 2011  7:45PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm about as satisfied with the results as I can be- it's a shame Daumantas didn't follow up on the Serbian attack, and also a shame that our border relations seem to be stressed- but I'm certain that even with the Ionian falling, you'll be able to give Paul a valuable lesson in just how one retreats behind enemy lines, and proceed to kick much butt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310175/#Comment_310175" name="Item_644" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-29T20:41:26+00:00" title="January 29, 2011  8:41PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, now I see!<br/><br/>Mel's "support me into Tunis" move was just the same thing Daniel pulled earlier: an attempt to disguise a move into the Western Med as something entirely other than playing for position towards a move on the MAO.<br/><br/>Don't worry, Mel; I won't hold it against you.

A little helpful nudging never hurts when it's about moving forces away from a defensive position, I suppose!<br/><br/>Daumantas, <br/><br/>Do we really want to bounce back and forth for a while longer here?

France is at war with England, and calls upon all Liberty loving nations to come to our aid!<br/><br/>The move to Western Med was exactly as it was presented, an effort to de-escalate the conflict with England.  The situation at the end of Spring was correctly interpreted by Daumantas--a situation where the Wes Med fleet would have to 'rush back' to the West to defend France.  All since then, including discussion regarding Warsaw, has been a deception aimed at England--certainly not at Italy.  Wes Med's attention is now entirely on the Atlantic.  <br/><br/>Paul and Daumantas,<br/>If you are both truly interested in looking for another path forward, let me mediate an Armistice and future plan to counter England's dominance.  <br/>The prize is a split of the Iberian peninsula between you.  <br/>The mechanics involve Turkey's retreat from the Ionian to the Eastern Med--not Apulia.  This is a sign of good faith.  Subsequently, I invite Tunis to move to NAf.  Italy must abstain from seeking Tunis.  As Mediterranean powers, we will need four fleets to defend the Straits of Gibraltar, once England masses its forces south.  <br/>The movement to Iberia will be accomplished via convoys conducted by fleets not involved in defending the Straits.  <br/>I accept that this will weaken France in the near term.  In return, Brest will be liberated, France will be awarded all of Great Britain, as well as all contemporary English possessions at the time of the fall of London, other than St Petersburg were that still to be in English hands.  St Petersburg will be returned to Russia, if Russia has not already reclaimed it.    <br/><br/>In the event Italy does take Tunis following a Turkish move to NAf, France will assist Turkey reclaim Tunis regardless of other demands on French forces.  <br/><br/>Daumantas and Willow,<br/>Although England would much prefer the resolution of the 'Western Triangle' remain separate from resolution of the 'Eastern Triangle', there is no reason that this need be the case.  It is actually not true that the path to England runs through French possessions.  That path actually runs through English continental and Scandinavian possessions.  I, therefore, have no qualms about encouraging an accommodation between you that frees Russian armies to shift north and west.  The only exception with regards to French possessions is Munich, which will be pivotal in Russian offensives aimed at Berlin and Kiel and, as long as it is in French hands, will assist in such offensives.  <br/><br/>Come to some decision on Serbia; whether as an adjunct or possession.  Initiate a discussion on equity, to balance Russia's gains in central Europe with compensation for Turkey.  For Russia, Note that Italian and Turkish fleets will be necessary in any efforts to counter England, and are well suited to complement Russian armies.  Most important, recognize that English forces are growing at a rate neither of you--none of us--can match alone.  United, however, there is still time to prevent a Europe dominated by Britain.<br/><br/>Bill,  You and I are in desperate times.  Live or die, we will never surrender!  <br/><br/>Viva le France!<br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310181/#Comment_310181" name="Item_646" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-29T22:45:37+00:00" title="January 29, 2011 10:45PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All:<br/>I had been ignoring Jason Morningstar's thread about ignoring threads but I have stopped ignoring it because you never know what might be interesting.

Even if I uphold my end of the bargain, it is contingent on Italy not being dead - something that Russia can work forwards semi-effectively now, too, provided fleet cover for Italy is sparse - which it would be under this plan. iii) France has no free units to help me retake Tunis if it's lost - West Med is pegged for English defense. iv) Precarious gains away from anywhere I can defend them, instead of finally getting the italian issue done with, which nets me a lot more probable SC gain.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm certainly willing to consider a "Stop the english at MAO" strategy, but there are too many variables here that are completelly out of my control for me to support this plan.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo.<br/>\n<br/>\nWillows,<br/>\n<br/>\nTrieste and Serbia next year?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310187/#Comment_310187" name="Item_648" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-30T07:01:06+00:00" title="January 30, 2011  7:01AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The move to Western Med was exactly as it was presented, an effort to de-escalate the conflict with England.

finish the game here as is, so let's do just that and look for alternatives for the next game, should that become pertinent.<br/><br/>As for the Mediterranean situation, it doesn't seem like a bad idea for the French fleet to support Italy into Tunis, actually - I'm willing to do a short armistice with France to bring this about, no problem. A moratorium on the naval war in MAO, say? The dividents of this action seem pretty good, as Italy likely won't need any more help after the one push, assuming he can keep the position for the fall and thus force Turkey the disband an unit.<br/><br/>Willow, now that I'm here: once you build in Moscow this winter, I suggest that we work carefully to disengage; I think that you'll agree with me in that escalating our relationship at this juncture would mostly just encourage Turkey to take liberties in the Balkans. To achieve a secure disengagement I'm willing to forego the usual StP-Mos move this spring, thus allowing you to move south from Moscow without having to bounce me; you know that I'm to be trusted in this matter by looking at the map and projecting your own response to a foolhardy StP-Mos stab - I could not hold Moscow in the fall no matter how much force I'd move east in the spring, so it is completely unrealistic to expect me to flagrantly provoke you in this. I will, of course, move to defend StP in the spring, but the move in question will not have offensive capability (you know the move I'm discussing here); once you move Moscow away and we return to status quo, I'll be able to disengage my extra safeguards as well. As always, it benefits us both to keep the price of security low on our mutual border by limiting the amount of force we station in the area.<br/><br/>All that being said, let me add that I'm happy for the success of our Russian allies in the Balkans, and we look forward to sharing the European mainland with the Romanov family.

We all like seeing Turkey bottled up and impotent in the corner, you see, and there's not one among us who'd benefit of a Turkey that combines the Italian SCs into his might, lurking in his corner potent, invincible and absolute master of all that is Mediterranean. Much better for us if Italy prospers, pushes back the Turk and refutes resolution of the eastern triangle.<br/><br/>I'm only too happy to negotiate with France to help transfer some aid to Italy; the Italian situation is in balance, even a small amount of foreign aid could decisively tip the scales against the Turk. I'm sure that Mel would also much rather see a surviving Italy proffering him prospective aid in Iberia rather than a massive, expansionist Turkey with too many fleets to spare, and of course he is as concerned as I am with the Russo-Turkish expansionism on the continent - Italy is in ideal position to constrain such developments, offering constant pressure on the Balkans. I'm only too happy to push strongly for detente with the French over this matter, as a strong Turkey is no more to my benefit than anybody else's at the moment.

To achieve a secure disengagement I'm willing to forego the usual StP-Mos move this spring, thus allowing you to move south from Moscow without having to bounce me; you know that I'm to be trusted in this matter by looking at the map and projecting your own response to a foolhardy StP-Mos stab - I could not hold Moscow in the fall no matter how much force I'd move east in the spring, so it is completely unrealistic to expect me to flagrantly provoke you in this. I will, of course, move to defend StP in the spring, but the move in question will not have offensive capability (you know the move I'm discussing here); once you move Moscow away and we return to status quo, I'll be able to disengage my extra safeguards as well. As always, it benefits us both to keep the price of security low on our mutual border by limiting the amount of force we station in the area.</blockquote>\nI am looking into this extremely skeptically- you seem to be garnering quite a bit of utility from that unit in my corner of the map.

The tactical issue is that while you have an army in StP and another in Warsaw, you could conceivably try a blitz to Livonia and a supported attack on StP in the fall, routing my stalwart home defense. For this reason I am suggesting, constructively, that we would both benefit if you move away from Moscow, trusting in my promise to hold this spring. You do not need to be certain about my fidelity here as long as you're going to keep two of your armies in the vicinity anyway: if I betray my promise, you can just support yourself into Moscow in the fall, foiling my (stupid) stab. Meanwhile, I will play a defensive move <i>with my fleet</i> in Livonia to ensure that you do not make that attempt at StP, after all. (I'll say it because I'm trying to be as explicit as possible here: my fleet in Livonia has no offensive potential whatsoever against you, but it does guarantee that no amount of force coming from the south is able to threaten StP.)<br/><br/>I think that our arranged bounce in an empty Moscow serves us both reasonably well, as it ties down only one unit on each side in defense. Moving your side of the defensive line to Moscow unilaterally is not acceptable to me, as it allows the aforementioned quick assault on StP, thus obliviating the point of keeping only a limited force on position. It is true that in the short term your defense is just as effective with an army in Moscow as it is with the bounce we've been practicing, but this is an unstable situation: once you have the army in Moscow, I'm forced to commit a second unit to the defense, and although this unit will be a fleet this year, <i>it won't be that for long</i>: I have no motivation whatsoever to not replace a fleet in Livonia with a second army ASAP if our border situation spirals out of control - if I'm going to commit two units to the StP defense, they might as well be the most appropriate units for local needs, and that means a second army that can threaten Moscow effectively. This in turn means that you need to commit a second army yourself to counteract, and then we are both the poorer for it; we'd have doubled our military commitment to our mutual border for no good reason.<br/><br/>Note that insofar as the immediate tactical situation goes I'm already committing that second unit to StP this year, as there's no way I'm going to risk the Livonian blitz. This pretty much takes my fleet out of any useful action for a full year, meaning that I won't be losing anything materially by bringing that second army in via Norway next year, should that prove necessary - I can't get my fleet back without bringing in the army, so why not. Thus this potentially irreversible decrement in border relations can be realized in a perhaps surprising short time-frame; I won't be sitting in Livonia with that fleet until some vague future time, it'll be in 1913 when the second army lands and in 1914 you'll have a supported attack on Moscow to contend with. The decision-point for you is not whenever you feel like retreating from Moscow, it's right now: if Moscow's not empty in the fall, I'll be moving my fleets into position for convoy in 1913 and keeping my Livonian fleet in position, which all is just more reason for me to go through with the second army landing.<br/><br/>In comparison, going with the initiative I'm offering here means that we'll continue as we've done so far: we bounce in Moscow with two armies while the majority of our respective forces concern themselves with other matters. For great Powers of our stature this is basically a peaceful, rational relationship that I see no reason to change; it is, in fact, a perfect set-up for a segue to a clean end-game three-way draw with whoever those Mediterraneans pick as winner in their southern wars. Meanwhile we both have active borders to the south, with plenty of opportunities; further progress in the Balkans or a simple Sev-Arm are moves full of potential for you in comparison to either a futile assault on the impregnable StP position or an aggressive fortification in Moscow.<br/><br/>I'll add that if the above seems too histrionic to you and you find it incredible that I would go to these lengths over the StP border, consider again: my French relations are well under control, and I am basically guaranteed a position in any draw on this table, but only as long as I keep the StP position well in hand, preventing you from enroaching into the Nordic area or building fleets up there. StP is a geopolitical treasure for England in this position. There is no tactical price I would not pay to preserve my position in StP, and making peace with France is just one of the things I'll be willing to commit if that's what it takes to secure my position.<br/><br/>I trust that the above detailed argument answers all questions as to why I'm suggesting the course of action I am. If there are any questions, I'll be happy to elucidate. Also note that vacating Moscow is not the only tactical security you can offer here: if you'll move the Warsaw army to Galicia, thus ensuring that you don't have a second army next to Livonia, that works for me just as well. I don't think that it's as good for you as emptying Moscow, as a Sev-Mos bounce is a more effective defensive move in many ways, but it's your call as long as the threat of a blitz on StP evaporates.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310329/#Comment_310329" name="Item_660" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-31T18:00:43+00:00" title="January 31, 2011  6:00PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Willow --<br/><br/>Since you're the only one who can unilaterally kick me out of Serbia, it's clear that my continued existence in the game depends upon your forbearance.

You may have given up on reclaiming St Petersburg through attacks from the south.  That means you will need to retake it through Scandinavia.  I will accept the loss of Munich as the price for England's defeat.  <br/>As you move west, consider your timing and your target carefully.  Defeating England will require fleets in the Atlantic.  Three English fleets bottle up the Mediterranean.  A handful of units hold St Petersburg indefinitely if attacked from the south.  Until and unless you reclaim St. Petersburg, you will need France to face England.  And France will need you!  One hundred years ago, in this setting, we French learned a hard lesson about making war on Russia.  It is time for the English to learn that same lesson! <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310804/#Comment_310804" name="Item_679" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-03T09:37:45+00:00" title="February  3, 2011  9:37AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310805/#Comment_310805" name="Item_680" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-03T09:38:21+00:00" title="February  3, 2011  9:38AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The devil you know is better than the devil you don't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310814/#Comment_310814" name="Item_681" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-03T10:25:58+00:00" title="February  3, 2011 10:25AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul,<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, I wanted to arrange a bounce in West Med between our two fleets, to deny England access to the Med.

And even if it had worked, it only would have spared Trieste for one more turn. I thought at first that maybe A:Ser-Bud, I:Tri S Ser-Bud might have bounced R:Bud-Tri, R:Vie S Bud-Tri, since that's two equally well supported attacks wrangling over the same territory. But then I realized that they're not actually directly countervailing (head-to-head), so I guess actually Bud-Tri would have succeeded, dislodging A Tri and cutting its support, which means that Gal-Bud and Ser-Bud would then have bounced, still leaving me nowhere to go but Albania. So I was doomed no matter what I did, and it looks like so was Trieste. Sorry about that.<br/><br/>I suppose if you had been resigned to losing Trieste you could have ordered Tri-Ven, Adr-Ven, bouncing yourself and keeping Apu out if he had gone for it. Alternately, if your main interest was to get an army into Venice, you could have ordered Tri-Ven, Adr S Tri-Ven, since T:Apu-Adr or T:Apu-Ven would both have had the same effect: letting your army make it in.<br/><br/>But now you've got to disband and it's a tough choice, since anything you do leaves you highly vulnerable. Were it me, I'd retreat A Tri-Tyr now and disband F Ven in the winter, for reasons that should be obvious upon reflection.<br/><br/>Anyway, enjoy the exquisite torment of being slowly ground into paste by the twin clubs of the Juggernaut.

I know, Willow knows and you also know that it was the spring move when I wrote that piece - and it is easy to confirm that I did not move to Moscow on that turn, just like I promised. On the fall move I continued our bounce, just like we'd discussed earlier. I'm sure Willow will correct me if I actually did something against our negotiation this year.<br/><br/>This is again pertinent this coming spring, in fact, as Willow's going to be building again in Warsaw. Willow: let's do the same play again, that seems to be keeping the peace between us. Note that I will <i>not</i> move to Moscow in the spring so as to enable you to move out of Moscow then if you want. In the long run it'd be easier for me if you got out of both Moscow and Warsaw (or Sev, presumably) at once, so that you could build new units without me having to commit that fleet into Livonia just because you happen to have units in both Moscow and Warsaw at the same time. Also, vacating Moscow would give you an extra unit down south, effectively; unless you're expecting a Turkish attack, Sevastopol is sufficient both for bouncing me and for preventing a trivial Turkish convoy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311028/#Comment_311028" name="Item_693" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-04T00:53:30+00:00" title="February  4, 2011 12:53AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>Paul --<br/><br/>Anyway, enjoy the exquisite torment of being slowly ground into paste by the twin clubs of the Juggernaut.

As long as BLA is held by Turkey, I have no need to fear a full-fledged russian assault, which in turn frees me up (more than once this already happened!) to do things with Russia I'd otherwise consider way too risky. Admit it - it kept you honest more than once too, right?<br/><br/>Obviously, I don't particularly need that fleet right there right now, but nor do I urgently need it anywhere else. How about I phase out the infantry part of the equation, moving my ground troops to the Greece-Serbia-Bulgaria triangle? Eventually, if all goes well, parts of that will go to Tunisia or some other exotic place.<br/><br/><br/>I don't have any secret plan to stab Russia in the back, if that's what's worrying you - I see no way I could get a solo win, as that would mean getting units either to StP or beyond MAO, both of which seem equally impossible... And if I am to take part in a draw, Russia's continued existance is my best bet - I certainly don't have the means to stop a western land-based incursion, and your capacity to do so alone, without even having to enact it, is very important in stopping from huge strides being made in that front.<br/><br/>I'm comfy with the current arrangment, as I said earlier.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311161/#Comment_311161" name="Item_699" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-04T15:01:25+00:00" title="February  4, 2011  3:01PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoops.<br/><br/>Looks like I forgot to order a retreat.

Turkey will still want Naples soonest, but might agree to spare Rome for a year or two, depending on how useful the Italian fleet would be.  It would be an unhappy time for Italy, as a Turkish adjunct, but anything might happen as long as a unit is on the board.   I certainly would like to see Italy survive, with a fleet in the Western Med, ready to help defend or liberate Spain.  And Turkish fleets in the Atlantic in order to defeat English aggression.<br/><br/>The selling point for Italy is that Turkey has only a limited amount of time to break out into the Atlantic before England seals off the Straits of Gibraltar.  A French collapse would allow England to bottle up the Mediterranean in 18 months or less.  It would be a Pyrrhic victory for Turkey to completely defeat Italy, only to be trapped in the Med.   <br/><br/>Others would suggest abandoning the Italian peninsula and grabbing Marseilles.  This would at least leave Italy with a supply center and a unit, which could then be a mercenary to the highest bidder.  Not a particularly noble act, but all's fair...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311273/#Comment_311273" name="Item_705" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-05T15:21:00+00:00" title="February  5, 2011  3:21PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All eyes are on the Baltic Sea fleet.

Any delays in Italy's defeat gives England more time to further weaken France.  So England would be in support of Franco-Italian cooperation, but only so long as the support was from France to Italy.  Italian occupation of Marseilles would, of course, be this one-way sort of cooperation.  <br/><br/>Russia will need a strong France in order to push back English conquests in central Europe, en route to gaining Scandinavia and liberating St Petersburg.  Therefore Russia would oppose an Italian move to Marseilles.  (I discount entirely the possibility of Russo-English cooperation against France.  How could it be that Russia would cooperate with the occupiers of St Petersburg?  It simply is inconceivable.)  <br/><br/>Turkey's reaction would depend on whether or not he is concerned with being blockaded in the Mediterranean.  Cooperation with Italy and France now could see Turkey in the Atlantic this year.  After that, Italy's survival depends on how useful the Italian fleet is to Turkey.  But it's a future.  If Turkey is not concerned about England blockading the exit from the Med, then Italy's survival at French expense is immaterial.      <br/><br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311311/#Comment_311311" name="Item_709" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-05T22:48:34+00:00" title="February  5, 2011 10:48PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>For what it's worth, I concur with Paul: once Italy falls, France'll be an obvious choice for the last victim before a three-way draw.</blockquote>\nFortunately, none of the participants in this struggle are satisfied with the obvious.  An alternative, yet strangely enticing  scenario, would see Russia, Turkey, and France cooperating to make England the last victim before a three way draw--or even the second to last victim before a two-way Juggernaut victory. <br/><br/>The scenario would unfold generally along the lines of France's role as a pivot point around which Turkey and Russia would apply force against the English defenses.  Turkish fleets, supported by France, swing west and north first into the Mid Atlantic and then beyond, so long as Turkey moves before England has a chance to establish a defense of the western approaches.  France, Italy, and Turkey can mass five fleets against the Mid Atlantic this year--versus England's three.  Unless England moves now to cover exits from the MAO, further exploitation from MAO will be possible next year.  <br/>Simultaneously, Russian forces shift north and west.  Russian armies certainly threaten Berlin, and may take it with French support from Munich.  In any case the fleets England needs to block exploitation from the MAO are also the forces England needs to use to hold the central European possessions.  He can't do both.  From the German heartland, Russian forces--in light of a weakened England, who must disband some forces after losing Berlin and Kiel, and who faces continued pressure from Turkish fleets in the west--eventually breakthrough into Scandinavia to finally liberate the staunch citizens of St Petersburg who are tired of fish &amp; chips and being forced to learn English in school.  <br/><br/>France is key to this scenario.

As you know, we all need to be able to put commensurate pressure on each other to achieve a three-way draw, and we need to use that capability to restrict and contain each other's capability for expansion so as to prevent any one player from overwhelming the other two. Willow's not in overbearing position yet, but her aggressive thrust at Germany just now means that she soon will be, and the moment is now good for you to take your share: you can easily claim Rumania for yourself this fall, thus balancing Russia's 1-2 SC gains of the year and ensuring that she doesn't achieve total domination against you. You'll still have some capability for pressuring her later even if she grows clearly stronger than you, but if you establish the pressure now, you'll be able to take a concrete SC gain as well, thus making it easier for yourself to keep the border no matter what Russia does. After all, the real remaining issues of the board are Italy and France, neither of which is a Russian concern, so there's no reason for Willow to make too much gain while we have to struggle with the remaining excess Powers with only our own strength. Left to her own Willow might theoretically grow strong fast enough to make an attack on yourself a realistic option as she calls her option on a solo victory (which Russia could theoretically claim by overpowering both Turkey and France) - by acting early enough you'll pre-empt this option and reduce your own grief down the line considerably.<br/><br/>To clarify, I'm not suggesting that you go any further than claiming what SCs naturally fall to your sphere of influence; there's no need to make a serious thrust at Russian vitals unless you have ambitions beyond a RTE-draw. Just stay aware of the need for balance, and act proactively to preserve it. Besides, any builds gained this way can be leveraged against Italy, thus bringing you to our mutual borderline in Gibraltar quicker.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311379/#Comment_311379" name="Item_717" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-06T21:02:54+00:00" title="February  6, 2011  9:02PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>I've been looking at the board a bit, Daumantas, and I think it's time you start putting a bit of pressure on Russia. </blockquote>\nSee, Willow, this is how it begins.

I won't hesitate to say that I would doubt the honesty of any player who manages a two-way draw in a DIAS game; the last few turns of such a game would be so complex and unlikely to orchestrate that the third player would have to be somehow defective to be unable to force a victory for one party or the other - and that's what he should do, as an early thrown (or seemingly thrown, anyway) game for either side should by all rights trigger a war between the two dominant parties, forcing them to acknowledge the third minor Power as a forced party to the draw simply because neither has the strength to remove the third player while simultaneously preventing the victory of the other dominant Power. Remember that a two-way draw would necessarily end in an SC count of 17-17 between the two players, and if either even momentarily ends at 18 SCs, they win the game. I am aware that two-way draws happen now and then, but I've yet to witness it in a DIAS game without metagame collusion: playing towards that draw only makes sense if you've agreed outside the frame of the game to do it with the other guy, not caring about your duty of fighting for victory. Utterly dishonorable, if you ask me.<br/><br/>The above is not to say that a player might not conseivably use a "two-way draw" as a diplomatic argument in an effort to sneak into a solo victory. That requires a very naive board, though, as the prospective two-player ally is likely to understand the endgame logic just as I've outlined it above - they would never agree to eliminating the third player if they themselves weren't in an even better position to seize a forced solo at some point in the proceedings. In our particular game, assuming that Turkey conquers Italy and I conquer most of France, Turkey will in fact be in a better position to take himself over the solo line by attacking Russia: his home SCs are closer to Russia than mine, and he has a better army-fleet mix in a better initial position. Engaging in that sort of two-way draw plot, even assuming that Daumantas wasn't familiar with the impossibility of the same, wouldn't be smart for me in this situation.<br/><br/>Mel, I have to say that I appreciate your active diplomatic efforts at finding a roadmap to a future that doesn't involve everybody else killing off France. However, it seems to me that most permutations that involve joint attacks at England are sadly incredible. Would you be willing to consider a peace with England, instead? A future play where we resupply Italy and stop the Russian assault over the Ber-Mun line seems wraught with potential, and where a draw arrangement without England seems like pure fantasy, I could just about see a France-Turkey-England draw as a tenable end to the game. In practical terms I might suggest that you give up Belgium, I give up Brest and while I would have to insist on keeping MAO, I could do it by moving a portion of my fleet to the Med to reduce my overall force concentration in the immediate environs of France. The fact still remains that my ability to project force mostly concerns the coastal regions, which means that relinquishing the Netherlands to me already reduces the tensions between us to negligible levels, and your core army strength will be a valuable resource for our alliance in the end-game when combined with my fleets.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311457/#Comment_311457" name="Item_719" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-07T09:24:04+00:00" title="February  7, 2011  9:24AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Daumantas-<br/><br/>I'm concerned about your movement of armies into the Balkans- that's kind of the opposite of what we talked about.<br/><br/>How about you support my Tyrolia army into Venice, and move Serbia to Trieste, move Gre-Alb and Bul-Gre.

He can easily take Venice and Rumania, plus the rest of Italy a little further down the road. In addition, in order to free up space to build new units, he can only move those armies in Ser-Bul-Con into your current possessions: Trieste, Rumania, and/or Budapest.<br/><br/>That sort of position is certainly desirable to Turkey, and likely would cement his position in a possible draw even further. <br/><br/>In any case, once he takes more territory (which he will, either from you or from me), he will be building more units back in his home centres. With four fleets already in the water, chances are good many of those will be armies. So, you can expect to see a stronger and stronger Turkish army on your Southern flank as this game progresses. This will only increase the temptation for him to grab some more territory, and increase your dedication of forces to that front. (And Daumantas is very openly opportunistic, as he has stated many times in this game: he goes to where the SCs are, not where honour or allegiance suggests is most "proper".)<br/><br/>If you agree with my logic, you might consider that keeping Italy alive a little longer may be very much to your benefit. It doesn't do much to slow you down, but very much helps you stay ahead of Turkey in any possible arms race/escalation race.<br/><br/>Just a thought. I hope you'll think about it too. It may have important ramifications further down the road when the Great Powers are choosing which of the four of you will be the first to fall...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311464/#Comment_311464" name="Item_721" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-07T09:54:28+00:00" title="February  7, 2011  9:54AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Two-way draws are an illusion of fetid play,  .</blockquote>\nExactly!

My hands are tied however, with an obligation to free French soil of foreign occupation.  Everything else is negotiable.  You will no doubt agree that my actions have been entirely defensive (with regards to England) in an effort to avoid exactly the circumstances in which we are now.  The next steps towards Anglo-French de-escalation must come from your side of the Channel.  I am unlikely to hold Belgium; having offered it before as a token of friendship I will defend it as best I can now but not miss it once gone.You are unlikely to hold Brest but we will destroy that British Army before allowing Brest to fully fall under its sway.  The Mid-Atlantic must be French or vacant--at some point--for exactly the reasons you point out.  Three French coastal centers border the Mid Atlantic and would have to be garrisoned so long as England could both occupy those coastal centers, particularly as you have demonstrated with convoyed armies, and follow-up with a supporting fleet.  But it is all a simple matter of establishing some confidence building measures.

However, it's equally true that your fleet entire is an issue for England - it's large enough to be threatening, and it's all positioned on the Atlantic coast now. I wouldn't have an issue with it were it positioned in the Med, but getting it there right now is a bit tricky. A demilitarized MAO is not impossible by itself, provided I get at least one fleet down south quickly to aid the struggling Italy.<br/><br/>I'm sure that you'll find my next set of moves pretty conciliatory, if not outright trusting, so perhaps you'll take the opportunity to disarm some of that fleet strength. I could see myself moving down into the Med with my MAO fleet at the next opportunity once I come to believe that the possibility for inter-occidental cooperation exists, provided that my moves go well and remove much of the current negotiation pressure.<br/><br/>(You probably don't want to take tactical advice, but if you'd attack strongly at MAO this turn, followed by a disband of the fleet that makes the attack in the winter, that might be the most secure and quick disarmament plan available.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311589/#Comment_311589" name="Item_724" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-07T23:41:24+00:00" title="February  7, 2011 11:41PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Willow</cite>I'm concerned about your movement of armies into the Balkans- that's kind of the opposite of what we talked about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DWeird</cite>How about I phase out the infantry part of the equation, moving my ground troops to the Greece-Serbia-Bulgaria triangle?

To be explicit, I'll be expecting you to disband F MAO (and a second fleet, ideally), leaving MAO demilitarized and your army strong (read: able to push Russia back), just as discussed. After that you'll have a genuine chance at retaking Munich, building a Marseilles fleet perhaps, and pushing west through the Med (perhaps aiding Italy) while I do my thing up north. This play has the potential to turn out as a EF(T/R) three-way draw, which is nothing to sneeze at in your current, otherwise doomed position.<br/><br/>In case anybody has any illusions about why I would do the above, the obvious reasoning is that mixing up an otherwise very comfortable three-way draw might open up new options for a solo victory further down the road. Because my own position is supremely secure, draw-wise, I can afford to shake things a bit. For example, the leeway I provide for France now is not enough for him to kill me even should he choose to betray my trust, considering the geopolitical logic of Turkey's moves once Italy falls in a year or two. (Again, to be explicit: Turkey's attack on France's back finishes him off and provides the three-way draw if France opts to take my opening and try a futile counter-attack on me.) The effective default ending for the game, should we all continue playing conservatively, is a ERT draw, but at least I'm feeling good enough about my chances to try and see if that can be changed at this late date. Perhaps this just results in the same draw anyway, or a different draw, or maybe I'll get that solo through some convoluted path that is as yet unforeseen.<br/><br/>(The above is just the sort of thing that doesn't get said in public without a weird variant like this one. Should be educational.)<br/><br/>Anyway, let's see what Mel does in the winter - I bet it'll be interesting. It'll also be interesting if he beats the odds and foils my own, supremely peaceful yet efficient play in the fall, thus causing peace to become a non-issue. The irony would be dense enough for a pudding.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311663/#Comment_311663" name="Item_726" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T09:10:56+00:00" title="February  8, 2011  9:10AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *sigh*<br/><br/>If you must.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311691/#Comment_311691" name="Item_727" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T10:42:10+00:00" title="February  8, 2011 10:42AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well well, seems like Russia's making a weak sort of bid here - I wouldn't characterize this as a solo rush, as despite the activity on all fronts, follow-through and focusing of force is lacking.

Paul, here's what I'd do in your stead: offer to support Adr-Tri with your F Ven in exchange for Turkey moving Tun-Ion in the spring. The carrot is that Turkey gets Trieste, the stick is that England will support you into Tunis if Turkey doesn't find it smarter to cooperate. Note how the Turkish fleet in Trieste serves to stabilize your relations, as it's not any more offensive in that position towards you, while it certainly does offer you some protection against Russia merely by being present. Also, if Turkey should lose the position later, disbanding the fleet would be an excellent peace overture towards Italy. The English part there is a given, I'd be happy to help you haunt the Turk insofar as you find it tactically fruitful.<br/><br/>The mid-term outcome of the above could well be a stabilization of the Italo-Turkish relations, at least assuming that the Turk finds it better to focus on his Russian troubles for the time being. (It's notable that one of the most effective Turkish moves for dealing with the Armenian army involves going Gre-Aeg-Smy, which only works if he leaves off the Italian war.) Turkey might also find a stable Italy a better bulwark against the west if he perceives himself unable to take full benefit of the Italian weakness while also worrying about the Balkans situation. Turkey might still prefer to keep one fleet in the Ionian Sea, but even that's a considerable improvement from the Italian viewpoint.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311704/#Comment_311704" name="Item_729" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T11:29:43+00:00" title="February  8, 2011 11:29AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fall 1913, prior to retreats:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-small-23527-25-R.png"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311716/#Comment_311716" name="Item_730" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T12:06:17+00:00" title="February  8, 2011 12:06PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 8, 2011 12:10PM by Mel_White.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Mel, as you can see, I made a play for the partition I suggested earlier, complete with a relinquished MAO.

We have reached a point I had hoped to be at two years earlier, albeit with a slightly stronger France then.  No matter.  A French fleet will disband, but at this point it is unlikely to be MAO.  I intend to move a fleet to the Mediterranean in order to have influence in that region, to possibly cooperate with your fleet, and to provide additional options with regards to the defense of Marseilles.  MAO provides the quickest means of doing so.  This separation of naval power violates one of my own principles not to split the fleet, for the portions could then be defeated in detail.  But two French fleets in the Atlantic is, indeed, a threat to England by its simple existence.  One season of caution for you is outweighed by the benefit of the quick separation of the French 'fleet entire'.  I think you can judge my intent, at least in some small part, by Army's Ruhr's refocus away from Belgium.  To be sure, I expected to lose Belgium but if I intended to disregard the English offer for peace I would have made no efforts to protect Munich from Russia in order to strengthen and further embolden Russia. <br/>I am not about to question good fortune.    Belgium is a small price to pay for French survival, and I have no doubts that Belgium has bought that exactly.  The loss of Belgium will soon be countered with growth elsewhere.  <br/>As I have said, everything is negotiable.  Except one thing--we will not be dictated to.   If Mid Atlantic's presence at the start of Spring before it moves south is too much for you to bear then by all means resume your offensive.  As you said, in a three-way draw it is immaterial who your partners are.  Conversely, in a loss all that matters is the nature of the struggle.  We will be destroyed before we submit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311728/#Comment_311728" name="Item_731" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T12:48:20+00:00" title="February  8, 2011 12:48PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill,<br/>You are the key.

It is also true that I can withstand a turn's worth of extra excitement, considering my extremely stable strategic position - the very worst you could do is basically a thrust at the Irish Sea, followed by my bouncing you in Liverpool with my new army while I'd continue crunching my way inwards to France.<br/><br/>I suppose I'll have to move to give way in Wes, but that's not a problem: it'll be more effective to support the Italian to Tunis in the fall, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311859/#Comment_311859" name="Item_735" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-09T09:42:47+00:00" title="February  9, 2011  9:42AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2011 9:01AM by Mel_White.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            CBHZQEBFKSISELGAHZKZEUEFFEUMDPDZHOUMLBQKUMMBWNVIPSXCMTCHPH                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312033/#Comment_312033" name="Item_736" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-10T09:06:59+00:00" title="February 10, 2011  9:06AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, folks, I've been away on a trip for a little while, but it seems I didn't miss any action, due to all the retreating and building and other things that do not concern Italy.<br/><br/>Interesting negotiations going on here. My take:<br/><br/>Italian sailors cheer at the English explorers in the Mediterranean! Will Tunisia finally be liberated? Or is there some sense to English occupation of Tunis, while French fleets enter the Western Med?<br/><br/>Daumantas,<br/><br/>Eero's proposal to support your fleet into Trieste is an appealing one to me. Willow has other things to worry about at the moment (I'm sure she's looking at gaining either Munich or StP this year), so she is unlikely to support you into Venice until at least the Fall. A Turkish fleet in Trieste, on the other hand, would place all three of us in a fairly safe position in regards to each other. Russia's territory will be bordered by fleets, and thus safe; you and I will not be in any position to mount much of an attack on each other, either.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, you can take easily take Trieste and Rumania. Since Russia is likely to gain an SC this year elsewhere, this will leave Willow with one disband. It shouldn't be too hard at that point to convince her to disband Army Armenia, leaving everyone happy and you in a much stronger position, as well as without a Russian army in your backside. It's not a terribly unreasonable response to such a move, and would stabilize all your borders while allowing you to build simultaneously.<br/><br/>From your perspective, a relatively peaceful situation between you and I makes it more likely that France and/or England will sooner or later help you finish off Italy, as opposed to trying to keep me alive against your attacks in the goal of limiting your growth.<br/><br/>Let me know if you'd like me to order the support.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312035/#Comment_312035" name="Item_737" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-10T09:10:17+00:00" title="February 10, 2011  9:10AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm looking forward to Bill's mysterious underground (or underwater?) maneuvers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312040/#Comment_312040" name="Item_738" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-10T09:30:47+00:00" title="February 10, 2011  9:30AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Spring, 1914 (start)<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-small-23527-26-O.png"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312042/#Comment_312042" name="Item_739" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-10T09:34:37+00:00" title="February 10, 2011  9:34AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2011 10:03AM by Mel_White.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>I'm looking forward to Bill's mysterious underground (or underwater?) maneuvers.</blockquote>\nIt's more consultations with the former Emperor, now penning his memoirs.<br/><br/>And, as an aside, all the clues necessary to break the code are included in the clear text.

It may be the calm before the storm, for more English armies are on the continent than ever before--with reserves in England ready ready to embark.  Will the British Army finally reach Piedmont?  Or reinforce St Petersburg for a drive on Moscow?  Or resume war on France in the greatest deception since the Trojan Horse? Only the English know.<br/><br/>The Royal Navy's entry into the Mediterranean demonstrates English power.  It signals possible reprieve for Italy in the short term.  The long-term picture is more cloudy.<br/><br/>Russia's 1913 surge west and south, whether an aggressive defense or a probe to identify weak points puts Russia well in place to act independently in the West or to cooperate with other powers.  Like water, Russia will likely seek growth through the path of least resistance.  <br/><br/>For Turkey and Russia, the diplomatic chatter has to be of concern.  England, the leading power on the map, is contemplating a draw that discounts one of them.  Which one?  England and Russia are more likely to come to blows than England and Turkey.  But England is already promising help to Italy against Turkey, and making placating noises at Russia with regards to Livonia and St Petersburg.

Presumably Russia won't contest this, but it's still best to not take any risks. I also suggest maneuvering an army towards the Mar-Pie area - you'll note that I built to prevent myself from convoying from Lon, making your northern coast somewhat safer. Finally, let me know if you're willing to move MAO-NAf, which is better in that Turkey can't bounce it (due to my support) the way he can block Wes-NAf; I'll assume that you're moving MAO-Wes unless you say otherwise, and we can fix any Turkish interference in the fall if it comes to that.<br/><br/>EDIT: Also, Mel, we can bounce in MAO with your Spa fleet if you want.

Is it 1984 at England already?<br/><br/>Gentlemen, and I adress this to everyone - my only interest now is getting Eero out of the Med. I don't particularly care which way this gets done, but I do think that it has to.<br/><br/>Mel,<br/><br/>I'm sure you're aware that Eero can now get four fleets to your two in the area around MAO, provided he gets another build. Might be in your best interest to make sure he doesn't. How are you planning to cover Marseilles, by the way?<br/><br/>Paul,<br/><br/>I know when I'm licked - you can expect me to retreat from Tunisia on my own volition. I'm not a big believer in peace through disarmament, however - a fleet in Trieste is lonely, surrounded, and useless. I would not accept anything less than you supporting Serbia into that location if we are to talk terms of peace - which, incidentally, would not mean a big happy family in the East part of the map, but rather you assuming control over the West Med, me retreating my fleets and making some ways inlands against Russia.<br/><br/>That's a backup plan, though - I'd rather see you out of the game and Italy's lands under control by Turkey and Russia.<br/><br/>(Oh, and by the way - the day that England "helps" Turkey to conquer Italy is the day that I know the game's gone to Eero.)<br/><br/>Willows,<br/><br/>You're last because I have the most to say to you.<br/><br/>I don't much care about your current actions and see the reasoning behind them. Aside from the fact that this fucked up both our growth curves and made conquering Italy fast enough to be able to effectivelly push Eero out of the Med, of course. That part is a bit frustrating.<br/><br/>Now, the way I see it, we have two routes - an all-out attack on Italy, thus achieving Turkish control over the Med, or I retreat to a minimal position and do my best to help Italy push Eero out, cross my fingers and pray. Understandably, I'd much rather control Italy myself than hope that Paul is willing and able to perform the task. Whatever you're doing in the west can wait - simply put, it's either turkish control of the Med or english control of the Med, and which of these two happens will be decided very soon... On the other hand, you already have more than enough troops to guarantee your own security and provide a bulwark against the any western onslaught (provided you trust me enough to retreat all those armies at my borders), which is really all that's needed of Russia to secure a three-way draw.<br/><br/>In short, I want support Russia into Venice right now and get access to Trieste for Serbia for joint operations later (or just to keep my own forces afloat after the loss of Tunisia - nothing that Italy could do to stop Russia from losing Venice once it's there, so you'd be at no SC disadvantage either). Not going to accept anything less. Might accept other variations that allow for swift joint control of Italy, though (convoying A Arm is cute, sure. But it ties up my fleet and is uncertain and... just get it back to Sev and out of my hair).<br/><br/>Oh, please oh please just stop reading that chaos-mongering in tactical advice dressing Eero's spewing out (so basically, everything that Eero is writing at this phase of the game) altogether. Your relationship with England is purely tactics and guesswork now, and reading it seems to make you too jumpy for me to be able to work with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312078/#Comment_312078" name="Item_746" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-10T12:25:32+00:00" title="February 10, 2011 12:25PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/>Good copy on the naval maneuvers, north and south.  <br/>I appreciate English efforts to retain Munich for France.  Regretfully, the French sympathizers in the city are heading west--both complicating French military maneuvers and signaling some lack of confidence that even the English can liberate the city if it falls into Russian hands in Spring.  Should Russia overcome French resistance and take Munich, even combined Anglo-French forces could not take it back immediately...do you agree?  Assuming that Russia is willing to risk Warsaw, or give up a chance at St Petersburg.  I would not think Warsaw for St Petersburg is such a good deal. Why shouldn't Russia use those three western armies to attack Munich now?  I would...but then again, I have been losing units since I started, so perhaps I am missing the obvious.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312079/#Comment_312079" name="Item_747" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-10T12:29:35+00:00" title="February 10, 2011 12:29PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DWeird</cite>How are you planning to cover Marseilles, by the way?</blockquote>\nWe have changed all signs in Marseilles to read 'Piedmont'.

While the difference for me is minor (a fleet or an army there, it's still threatening Venice, same to me), I'm sure Daumantas would be very happy to have an <i>army</i> bordering on Vienna AND Budapest while you...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DWeird</cite>retreat all those armies at my borders</blockquote>\nYour border will certainly be in an interesting position then. Surely, I am but pointing out the obvious, but I wanted to let you know why I will not be supporting a Turkish army into Trieste. I hope you will appreciate the gesture.<br/><br/>Daumantas,<br/><br/>Tell me more about the threat of Eero in the Mediterranean. You seem to think he could suddenly take over in force. Do you suppose he can do that with one fleet? How? If not, how will maneuver more forces into our part of the world? What should we be concerned about here? You sound like you're worried about a hypothetical scenario: what is it?<br/><br/>(And, yes, my "happy" view could certainly take the shape of you sorting out your business with Russia while I turn West and do whatever is necessary for world peace, whether it's keeping England or France out of the Atlantic, or something entirely different. Indeed, if I thought you were down with that sort of plan, I would consider supporting your army into Trieste. At the moment, however, I have no reason to believe that you're trustworthy in that sense.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312084/#Comment_312084" name="Item_749" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-10T12:45:52+00:00" title="February 10, 2011 12:45PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mel,<br/><br/>I suspect Eero may have a plan that includes you holding on to Munich. I can see one or two possibilities for that, and if I'm guessing right about his short-term plans, it could work out quite nicely for you (certainly better than the position you're in now). Look at his movements: they suggest he's serious about an attempt to make sure France is not the first of the four powers to fall, but rather survives to a three-way draw. <br/><br/>We'll see what happens, but the fears you're outlining above... well, I think Eero has at least one trick he can play that will be in your favour.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312087/#Comment_312087" name="Item_750" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-10T12:50:21+00:00" title="February 10, 2011 12:50PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>well, I think Eero has at least one trick he can play that will be in your favour.</blockquote>\nLike what, teleportation?

I do have to clarify for his Majesty's government, though: we do not harbour any intentions towards the Mediterranean Sea, and in fact have great hopes that the French and Italian governments will find a peaceful resolution to the current troubles in the area. Our own fleet is there merely as a peace-keeping force. An end-game push at the Mediterranean (which has been predicted by the musulman for the last five years or so, note) is not in the cards in the foreseeable future, assuming our working relationship with the French government continues improving.<br/><br/>Mel, regarding Munich: my read concurs about the tactical realities, but it's too expensive for Russia to commit the troops - she'll lose Trieste and potentially Warsaw (who knows what those wacky English generals will do so far from home, eh) if she goes for it. Also note that we can force her out next year even if she goes for it (can't stop me from setting up in Kie-Ber), and she knows that as well. Much more sensible to cover Trieste and maybe Warsaw, as those are SCs she can hold. At the same time letting you get into Mun is not an immediate threat to her - not a threat at all necessarily, in fact - as you don't quite yet have positioning for any sort of eastern adventure. The best Russian play of the moment is not to start a western adventure against a seemingly united western front, but rather to establish herself in the Balkans and wait to see if we have a real western alliance going; if we do, it becomes pretty important for her to ensure that the draw is FER and not FET, and the best way to do that is to consolidate the Balkans, keep me out of Moscow and keep pressure on the Turk to help you cross the Med. Basically, if an Anglo-French alliance exists and is not just a cruel lie, then T &amp; R are in a pinch: the one that survives longest wins the eastern slot in the draw.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312092/#Comment_312092" name="Item_753" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-10T13:28:11+00:00" title="February 10, 2011  1:28PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>if an Anglo-French alliance exists and is not just a cruel lie</blockquote>\nI hate cruel lies.

Your forces can turn to where they can do the most good--securing and expanding Russian holdings in the Balkans.

Bulgaria will do one of those things. I assume that Budapest will be moving out as well, then?<br/><br/>Paul,<br/><br/>Nice attempt to use my words against me, but there is no secret plan here. Laid my cards quite bare - if I can't conquer Italy, I'm retreating to a minimal position, which also means I don't have much else to do but fight with Russia - given that that would mean France remains in the game, I'd then have to whittle down Russia as good as I can. That's a backup plan, though, in case I don't get requisite russian support in the endeavour.<br/><br/>You seem to have my plan A and B jumbled up into one!<br/><br/>Be prepared to lose Venice now though, mwahaha and etcetera.<br/><br/>Eero,<br/><br/>If you didn't get into the Med before, it's not for lack of trying, no? And it's not so much that I'm worried that you will be able to pull off a spectacular coup that will crush the whole western coastline in one blow - that's out of the cards, right.<br/><br/>Instead... When I think about what fleets are available to control the english fleet's movements? The answer is "none" - there are fleets in the water, sure, but all of those are preoccupied with other matters (and you are making sure that remains the case for the forseeable future! Fancy that!). That fleet is essentially free to do whatever it damned well pleases.

It <i>is</i> true that not only is Daumantas a rather bloodthirsty individual, but he also has a pretty strong interest in rolling over Italy. Then again, I don't even know if there would be a point doing such a support, as Mr. D might be only too happy to attack Tri-Ven with fleet support just to improve his Russian relations. Insofar as the Turk is concerned, killing off Italy and keeping Russia reasonably controlled is pretty much the Turkish dream scenario, insofar as draw arrangements are concerned. So it might be that you should actually encourage that Turkish army to stick around in Trieste so as to keep the Russo-Turkish relations from improving.<br/><br/>Either way, as long as you get Tunis this turn, Turkey will have food for thought: his strategy has for a while centered on annexing Italy, but the strong Tyrhenian SC triplet with two fleets and an army in Rome is such a tought nut to crack that he might have to back off entirely and escalate his on-off martial affair with Russia, instead. This is especially true when you consider the western commitment to an independent Italy. Even taking Venice successfully might not be enough if France moves up via Piedmont to help you maintain the line against the Juggernaut.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312227/#Comment_312227" name="Item_769" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-11T11:12:26+00:00" title="February 11, 2011 11:12AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daumantas,<br/>Studying the map, it occurs to me that I would not need Tunis if I could recover Munich.

However, take Venice with the fleet and you're up two SCs at the end of the year.

At least one or two out of the four attacks would probably go through.

However, Daumantas is holding the position of strength here, whereas Italy's existence hangs by a thread. If I were to act on any such plan, I would be opening myself up far more than Daumantas, who would at most be risking one SC.<br/><br/>Therefore, I simply cannot afford to be the one to make the first move in any such coordinated assault. If you want my help to push into the Atlantic (say), you'll need to be the first to make a gesture of peace: I simply cannot afford to do so.<br/><br/>(And, frankly, having you two barge into Venice instead of, say, trying to hold on to Munich and/or Berlin does not inspire confidence.

I'll have to hash this fiasco out with Mel, but ideally we'll think up something to allow the Italian to survive the baseless aggression of the Turkish horde. Perhaps support Ion-Tun in the spring as a late attempt at something or other, while also moving Mar-Pie to threaten Venice... grim, really grim from an Italian viewpoint.<br/><br/>Meanwhile the French lose an unit and Russia gains one; considering the last year's moves, I wouldn't be surprised by a fleet in Sevastopol. In fact, building in Sevastopol is something I warmly recommend to our sister the Czarinna: as we've explained before, building in Warsaw when there is already an army in Moscow is a clear and immediate threat to our position in the free city of StP. As hostilities between our Powers would prove both pointless and dangerous to the Russian responsibilities in central Europe, it is surely wiser to follow the old ways that have served us so well in preserving the peace to this day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312303/#Comment_312303" name="Item_780" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-12T09:58:08+00:00" title="February 12, 2011  9:58AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm...<br/><br/>To build a fleet where it has near no tactical use while simultaneously aggravating a thankful ally...<br/><br/>Or to build an army that would be in position to counter the rather obvious future landing of army Denmark?<br/><br/><br/>Indeed a dilemma!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312306/#Comment_312306" name="Item_781" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-12T10:10:22+00:00" title="February 12, 2011 10:10AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Willow and I are playing on a higher level, Daumantas.

Turkey and Russia are building this turn, at Italy and France's cost.<br/><br/>Any recommendations for a disband? Adriatic seems like an obvious choice, but maybe it's better to disband elsewhere and let Mel and Eero handle Tunis on their own?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DWeird</cite>In other news... Keeping Tunis is just luck, and I certainly don't expect it to last... But I do certainly welcome any favours the magnificient lady luck deems to grant me.</blockquote>\nSo, I've been wondering about this:<br/><br/>The Italian situation throughout this game has been rife with 50/50-type decisions, where one way would work out and the other would not. (The most obvious being, of course, the continuous assault of Tunis that has gone on now for five full years, with usually a 50/50 chance of success almost every turn of orders. Another example is Venice this turn: Willow made an error in her orders, and so attacking Trieste instead of Adriatic would have left Venice in my hands this turn.)<br/><br/>However, it seems that I have guessed wrong, every single time. Now, there have been a couple of cases where I can see, in retrospect, that I picked a moveset that was easily countered (like my silly attempt to convoy into Tunis a few years back), but overall it seems to me that the situation has been more or less even in the Mediterranean. Yet somehow Italy has lost out almost every time. At first I chalked it up to simple bad luck, but maybe I'm operating on some tactically-flawed reasoning? I've had great success guessing my opponents' moves in my other Diplomacy game, but here... seem to have missed every time. <br/><br/>What do you think: bad luck, or am I making some kind of tactical errors I'm not aware of?<br/><br/>Since I'm just learning to play Diplomacy, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this, more experienced folks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312309/#Comment_312309" name="Item_783" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-12T10:17:09+00:00" title="February 12, 2011 10:17AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>I believed that by pretending ignorance of the threat to Berlin I might encourage the Russians to attack there, allowing the French to seize Munich.

Unfortunately the enemy presence around Venice is pretty dense, which makes it difficult for you to retake the place even with French support if neither Russia nor Turkey decides to support you.<br/><br/>The problem in preserving Adr is that Naples and Rome are under dire threat here. With Tyr and Ion you can make taking those two an issue, at least, while with just one fleet you're making further attacking an obvious Turkish move. You should probably hold onto both fleets to preserve at least a semi-credible defense in the hopes that Turkey chooses this turn to finally turn on the Russian; if overrunning you does not represent a significant investment for Turkey, then it's an easy choice to hurry up with that, establish a defensive perimeter against France in the Tyr-Ion area and only then reconsider the situation.<br/><br/>Looking at the tactical landscape in the central Mediterranean area, the first and foremost Turkish concern is decimating Italy quickly so as to build up a coherent defense against the Franco-English fleet before we make it to the scene and turn the tables on him. While our own fleet merely meets parity against the Turk, we can support Italy and together have a majority against the Sultan. For this reason taking Italy down before we can combine forces is so important to Turkey - and this is also why the failure of the Tunis operation this year was so unfortunate, possibly game-changingly so.<br/><br/>It well might be the case that we'll have to go with NAf-Tun next spring as Italy bounces in Rom and Nap, then follow up with appropriately depending on whether Turkey plays Tun-Ion or not in the spring; his choice is basically whether to allow the Ion fleet to retreat east or leave it where it is. Probably Turkey opts for Tun-Ion, as his new build allows him to constrain the Italian fleet effectively even in an eastern retreat. In this case Nap falls in the fall, while the western fleets progress to the Tyrhenian Sea; 1916 begins with Turkish fleets in Nap and Ion, an Italian fleet in Tus and western fleets in Tyr and Tun. This position is unstable even with an army in Piedmont, so Rome falls in 1916, resulting in a typical end-game Mediterranean pattern with Turkey in control of Italian home SCs and France in Tunis.<br/><br/>(What I said here is not quite the whole truth, but I won't lay out the entire strategic field for Turkey - it's sufficient to say that something like the above has more than 50% likelyhood, although we might sucker him nicely if he didn't read every tactical suggestion I might make.)<br/><br/>The above prediction is pretty grim, but better outcomes are difficult to predict here. The main reason for a better result would be a real disagreement within the Juggernaut; this is not as unlikely as it sounds, as Russia is already at the greatest extent of her capabilities within the Juggernaut paradigm, and she'll start actually losing ground from next year onwards. Meanwhile Turkey and Russia both can project like above to pinpoint when the frontlines stabilize, which means that they know when the relative pressure on Turkish lines vs. Turkish gains in Italy leave him at his weakest, just like they can project the defensive requirements a hypothetical English attack on Russia would cause. Once that knowledge is on the table, either player might opt to refuse the simplification of the play-space that destroying Italy represents, instead choosing to turn on their partner in the hopes of affirming their own position in the draw (or in Russia's case, as a bid for a solo victory). They might admittedly choose to race towards the very outcome I'm outlining, but only at the risk that this means their own defeat: assuming a board where Italy is conquered by Turkey and Russia is pushed out of Munich, which of France, Russia and Turkey is the odd man out, considering that a four-way draw is not an option? (The reason for why four-way is not on the table is that even if everybody else is too chicken to play for a three-way, I'm in position to insist on it.) If either Russia or Turkey decides that it's most likely that we'll be pushing <i>them</i> out of the draw, then it is absolutely imperative for them to take steps against their current partner to ensure that the balance changes before the trenches stabilize so much that nothing more can be done.<br/><br/>Finally, let it be said that I'm all for an in-Juggernaut falling-out, myself. In fact, I'd be only too happy to ally with my good friend the Czarinna immediately, pacifying our mutual borders and allowing her to put all of her strength on the matter of the Turk, if she only took the first step. As we all remember, when massive forces are on the move and Powers are equally strong, the one who moves first wins the war. Turkey is admittedly the second-most difficult of our four Great Powers (after England, that is) to remove from the board due to his corner position, but I'm all for a Franco-Russian attempt at just that if only Czarinna could be made to see how dangerous it is for her to assume that the Juggernaut will bring her the draw. For all we know that crazy Englishman might go through with the French alliance, paralyzing Turkey and pushing at the northern Russian border until Turkey has no choice but to put her out of her misery.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312319/#Comment_312319" name="Item_791" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-12T11:06:15+00:00" title="February 12, 2011 11:06AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I can't pinpoint it perfectly, but I think there were a few instances where you could have moved or retreated to the Aegan, threating my largely unprotected home centers... And instead either stayed put or moved closer to home?<br/><br/>If you're on a roll and can gain a bunch of SCs quickly, losing a single home center isn't that big a deal - you can build right next to the invader and thus repel him, *and* most of your forces will be at the enemy front already - so it's rather useful to keep your home SCs empty and have every unit you can positioned to strike (a strategy not without diplomatic difficulties).<br/><br/><br/>Sudden insight/disclaimer: I am not sure why I am talking as if I was a Diplomacy expert. This is my third game, and my track record of success is actually not that great. It's perfectly possible that you did, indeed, just get a run of bad luck, compounded by having to play Italy, compounded by the handicap of the first poor years.

Without referencing the archive my own impression is that it's basically a bit of bad luck and some bad choices combined with good play from Daumantas - he's been fucking with you from day one both diplomatically and tactically as Turkey should if he's to dominate the Mediterranean, after all. It's true that most choices that Italy's been doing have been 50/50 or some variant thereof, but this is <i>always</i> the case with tactical choices: the thing that changes as power relationships change is the stakes of the moves, not their uncertain nature. This is because the certain elements are not a focus of tactical consideration. Basically, while at first the 50/50 might have been about eg. whether Turkey loses a SC to Italy or not, and later on the issue might have been whether Italy loses Ion to Turkey or not, or which one of the two loses a SC to the other, now the situation is increasingly about whether italy loses a SC to Turkey, every turn. It's still a guessing-game on the particulars, but the stakes are constantly more favourable to Turkey.<br/><br/>There's no way around the fact that Italy's been getting a consistently bad deal from the open diplomacy environment: most other players have ignored the diplomatic elements to a much greater degree than Italy, which is understandable when we remember that Italy is always naturally under constant pressure, and therefore much more receptable to influence. (In fact, this is probably the biggest Italian lesson I have to offer: Italy absolutely has to lead in diplomacy even if he doesn't lead strategically, as otherwise he has no choice but to hang onto any sorry excuse of a plan that anybody else deigns to offer him.) This has made it easier for others to cause upsets where Italy moves according to the publicly agreed-upon plan only to find out that hey, not only is the other guy not following the plan, but Turkey's also specifically playing to counter that move. Fucking up the Austrian relationship was also a major, major hindrance to Italy - I can't emphasize enough the size of trouble Italy gets to by allowing Austria to die against the Juggernaut, leaving Italy with two strong Powers that have many good reasons for working together until the end-game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312321/#Comment_312321" name="Item_793" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-12T11:23:48+00:00" title="February 12, 2011 11:23AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On the other hand, D, your tactical play has always been sharp, and you've clearly learned a lot between your first game and today.

Doubtful. Can anything be done to remove him from the endgame? Doubtful.<br/><br/>Meaning, anything he does say and do now is with intent to solo.<br/><br/>Already, he can essentially remove France from the map - but not so quickly that Russia and Turkey would not be able to slide in and prop up a defense. Apparently, he will be keeping France alive (and using her as an ally and an asset to contain Turkey! Brilliant!) until he can either cordon France off from russian armies and/or turkish fleets... Or Russia and Turkey come to blows, allowing him to maybe pick a center or two off Russia. Both Turkey and Russia would be alive, of course, but in no shape to stop the map from turning orange.<br/><br/>The possibility of a russian solo is predicated on Russia breaking through StP and me completelly forgetting to mount a defense. One of those *might* happen, sure, but both of those together? Russia steamrolling not one but two fairly secure fronts? Longshot squared.<br/><br/><br/>In fact, I don't think there are actually any three way draw variations left - it's either Russia-England-Turkey, or an English solo. France could make a miracle recovery, of course, but I'm not betting on it. (Sorry, Mel... Tell me how I'm wrong if you can, please!)<br/><br/>Which in turn might mean that very soon we'll be in for a patience game - Eero has no reason to attack France in force, and France won't disappear until Eero chooses to do so... Meaning, yes, Russia and Turkey are contained, and yes, plenty of time for tensions to build, especially with England egging one or the other side on, and mistakes to happen.<br/><br/>I'm not sure Willow is the best partner for a waiting game for me, but I don't feel like I have a reasonable alternative to a Russia-England-Turkey draw (France can't even hold her own against England now, I think?), so I'll be sticking with that...

This returns France to its competitive stature relative to the other powers.  Why does England do this?  Simply because a French collapse in the Mediterranean creates a vacuum that will suck in Turkish forces while most of England's combat power is oriented north.  A French collapse in Central Europe puts England on the defensive leading soon after, no doubt, to a three way Rus-Tur-Eng draw.  So, France's survival is important to England in order to maintain the possibility of an English solo.  The possibility of an English solo is both real enough and tempting enough to Eero that England will spend a couple of years to see if the stars are right.  If not, England either falls back on the original three-way draw of Rus-Tur-Eng, or swaps France for one of the eastern powers.  It really would be unsatisfying for England to settle for a draw with the Juggernaut, considering Turkish struggles to get past the Ionian, Russia's passive acceptance of English demands, and the incoherent nature of the Russo-Turkish relationship.  It would mean, really, that England defeats France on behalf of Russia and Turkey--who couldn't do it themselves.  Eero's not going to do that for you, I'm afraid.   There is no doubt that included within England's planned 18 centers are 4 or even 5 of the current French centers--I think Marseilles would fall to Turkey.  But also included in the 18 are Moscow, Warsaw, and Munich--and England needs a neutral or even friendly France to get those centers.  England's route to a solo victory is much easier and simpler through Russia than through Turkey.  <br/>The policy implications for Turkey in all this are clear--shift the thrust of offensive actions north to take advantage of the potential for a double envelopment of Russia, conduct economy of force measures to limit options for the Russian probe in vicinity Armenia, eliminate Italy as quickly as possible in order to convert Italian units to Turkish armies, and shift to the defense on the maritime front to prevent English and French advances past Tunis in the Med.<br/>By that point, France will be expecting an English attack aimed at a solo, and so both preparing defenses and welcoming Turkish movements west.  Faced with resolute Turkish and French defenses--or even the risk of French self-sacrifice, England good-naturedly accepts the France-Turkey-England draw.  It is all very clear in my head.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312327/#Comment_312327" name="Item_798" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-12T12:39:22+00:00" title="February 12, 2011 12:39PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just between us, Daumantas, I rather like your game analysis - you project to the end-game with clarity, just like one should in Diplomacy, and you don't bullshit when it's not to advantage, but rather choose to deal with facts. Don't tell the others I said that, though. It is the utmost irony if I end up drawing this game because I've taught you too well as regards the end-game logic of Diplomacy, grasshopper <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Mel has good points, too - I can see that happening, definitely.<br/><br/>I've heard that there are people in the Diplomacy world who play the waiting game mulishly, refusing the obvious game-ending and thus forcing the other players to abandon the game out of boredom. This is, of course, unsportsmanlike, and not the policy of the English crown; should we find ourselves in a situation where our only choices are between ending the game in a draw or prolonging it in the hope of our opposition quitting in disgust, we will definitely take the draw. If and when Daumantas proves his thesis to my satisfaction I'll be only too happy to act on the conclusion. Meanwhile, we will see what happens.<br/><br/>One consideration Daumantas does not address is this: assuming that the Turkish analysis holds water, why would France not attack east most aggressively, inviting English forces into France? France and England together hold 16 SCs, which means that France is perilously close to being able to force a solo for England with minimal new conquests. A defeat is after all a defeat, and losing to a drawing coalition is no better than losing to a soloist, so these choices are equal for France. By threatening this action or even beginning to execute it the French can force the Juggernaut to break: either they make any concessions the French require, or France ensures that Turkey and Russia follow him to defeat. It's a grim strategy, but were the French premier to find himself convinced that the only alternative is a Turko-English assault on him from both sides, it is perhaps his last, best hope.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, I find that I disagree somewhat on the tactical realities of who has a chance in the draw. Specifically, France totally has some chance of getting in on the expense of Russia, assuming the Juggernaut doesn't manage to rearrange forces against the logical full-front assault the joint Franco-English HQ can manage over the Pru-Sil-Boh-Tyr corridor. Materially the situation is somewhat even (8 Juggernaut armies vs. 7 westerners with superior fleet support, basically), but I find myself suspicious of whether the Juggernaut is truly able to counter this move due to geographical realities: while the Franco-English forces have no trouble maneuvering in safe and efficient manner, the Juggernaut army force is split in a way that would require Turkish troops to travel over Russian terrain to reach relevant defensive positions. Will Russia be able to allow this when both know that for Turkey the quickest way into the draw is to stab Russia and allow a EFT draw? From Russia's viewpoint, the only way of preventing Russia itself from becoming the battleground is to either imbue an English assault on France or take the initiative against Turkey himself, thus removing the substantial motivation for the joint western assault at the root. The only issues here are timing and the danger of EFT draw considered against the danger of English solo should the Juggernaut break. The former will become clearer and clearer as the battlelines converge, while the latter will become more unlikely as English forces are committed in Russia. However, at the same time the Russian capability for even stabbing Turkey will drop sharply as all his forces are required in defense against the French armies pushing at him in the corridor; the timing is critical, but if Russia doesn't move within a year or two at most, we might reach a point of no return where the only alternatives are a dead Russia or a successful eastern defense that truly leaves us no other choice but to eliminate France to achieve a three-way draw. Of the two I find dead Russia massively more likely; Turkey might say right now that he has no intent to stab Russia once battle is joined, but when the moment is upon us the fact will be that Turkey cares of nothing but forcing a three-way draw with himself in it - should Russia allow a situation where Turkey can achieve this with a couple of turns of maneuvering against Russia, the choice will be easy.<br/><br/>But aside from those points (and a few other that I'll keep to myself for now), a most cogent analysis. I'd really like to be able to argue for Italy here, but unfortunately I find myself sceptical of the Italian ability to maintain himself despite any western aid at this point. We will do our best, but joint operations with multiple Powers are really rather horridly hampered by the open diplomacy environment, so I fear that Turkey will have a considerable tactical edge in the Italian peninsula for the next couple of years.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312341/#Comment_312341" name="Item_799" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-12T19:02:57+00:00" title="February 12, 2011  7:02PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>In fact, building in Sevastopol is something I warmly recommend to our sister the Czarinna: as we've explained before, building in Warsaw when there is already an army in Moscow is a clear and immediate threat to our position in the free city of StP.

It will be especially interesting to see how much of this logic will have its effect and how much is misdirection.<br/><br/>Does anyone see a possibility for Italy to throw the balance over in one direction or another? I am looking for options, and since my survival doesn't seem too likely, I could potentially be talked into some kind of interesting suicide gambit...<br/><br/><br/>Daumantas,<br/><br/>Your logic is sound, and makes sense tactically. However, in this game, I never felt like I had the luxury to be able to risk that kind of maneuver. There were two chances for me to retreat into the Turkish backside: Spring 1907 and Fall 1910. I considered it both times, but it didn't seem wise. In 1907, you had an army which would easily have kept my fleet from making any gains, whereas the same move would leave two of my SCs open to you, so I chose to retreat, not really seeing any possible gains. The Fall of 1910 was a more tempting moment, in some ways, and I still hold that had Bill and I maintained our alliance and had I retreated there, Turkey would have been in serious trouble. Unfortunately, at that very same moment, Bill abandoned his own territory to strike in my direction, and gave me the impression that he would not stop until I was dead, even if it cost him the game. [Edited to add: Not trying to blame Bill here. I did piss him off, so the aggression was entirely justified. I'm just saying that I had to worry about an attack from that side as well as from the sea that turn.]<br/><br/>I *could* have chosen to retreat into the Aegean at that point, threatening you. However, I chose not to: first of all, you had a build coming your way, which would allow you to easily block any grab I could make from that position (e.g. build an army in Smyrna and then self-bounce in Constantinople). Second, I had just lost two SCs and was surrounded by hostile forces (again, Bill was clearly not an ally at that point), with hardly enough forces to defend what territory I had left.<br/><br/>So, curious: Do you really think you would have retreated to the Aegean instead of moving in to defense, in my place? Take a look at Fall 1910. <br/><br/>(My retreat to the Adriatic was aimed fully at regaining Trieste, since I knew I would be losing Vienna the very next turn. I figured (and rightly so) that having that fleet in position would allow me to maneuver into position for another attack on Tunis--and I figured that had to work sooner or later, right?)<br/><br/>I'm honestly curious! I agree with Bill: what you're saying makes a ton of sense, even if it's skewed to a personal play-style (which is clearly quite effective).<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Still, by my count Tunis has survived <i>seven</i> consecutive 50/50 attacks, denying Italy a unified front and an additional build for many long years. That has been unfortunate luck, then!

By my count, four of the recent Italian attacks on Tunis were done unsupported, and in three of those there was no possible supporting unit (a French fleet could have supported in one attack--but was unlikely for various reasons).  The Fall 09/Spring 10/Fall 10 sequence is interesting.  You were just outguessed.  To recap the situation:  Italian fleets in Tyr and Ion, and Turkish fleets in Eas and Tun (and Aeg--but concerned with Greece).  While it may look like Italy has a numerical advantage relating to Tunis, the Turkish Eas fleet plays a big role.  So, in both Fall 09 and Spr 10, Turkey saved Tunis with Tun to Ion, Eas S Tun to Ion; which bounced Ion to Tun, Tyr S Ion to Tun.  Fall 10 is interesting.  (This is when Italy attempted the convoy from Albania to Tunis).  The Italian effort failed because Turkey now attacked and gained control of the Ionian.  The Turkish fleet from Aegean had moved to Greece in Spr 10 , in fact forcing the retreat of the Italian army to Albania.  It is ironic in that an Italian attack on Tunis the same as in the previous two attempts would have succeeded!  Having gained Greece, Turkey was likely 'willing' to lose Tunis in exchange for the Ionian, and retreating to Wes or NAf.  I would say this turn's results was less bad luck and more the result of a risky plan.  It does remind me that convoy rules in conjunction with attacks hurt my head a little.  The bottom line is that the convoy has to be successful before worrying about the effects of the convoyed army.  So, in this case, the Ionian convoy supported by Naples was displaced by the Turkish attack of Eas, supported by Gre and Tunis itself!  <br/>In this last turn, Fall 1914, an attack from Ionian supported by Tyr would have worked...exactly the attacks that failed in 09/10.  So...Daumantas is going to have to explain what 'tells' you are displaying that he is so successfully reading.  <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312369/#Comment_312369" name="Item_803" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-13T07:40:08+00:00" title="February 13, 2011  7:40AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Your logic is sound, and makes sense tactically.

But in 1910, I certainly would have; getting a unit past your attackers line is of considerable worth, since you have freedom to attack centers, forcing a defense, you could have supported attacks against Greece, and done everything considering the Ionian (attacking, cutting supports) that you could do from Apulia or the Adriatic.<br/><br/>For some examples of the worth of a unit next to the enemy's centers, consider the impact England's A St. Petersburg has had: Russia has had to commit an order every single turn to nullifying its influence (sometimes two).  The conflict of England and France has largely been over the strategic advantage of MAO, and you certainly know from experience what a thorn in your side Turkey's presence in Tunis has been.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312373/#Comment_312373" name="Item_804" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-13T09:41:14+00:00" title="February 13, 2011  9:41AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mel,<br/><br/>Quite correct. My multiple attempts at an unsupported attack on Tunis were exactly that: if Daumantas had ordered an attack on the Ionian (which he was likely to do, and had already tried multiple times), any one of them would have succeeded. But otherwise your analysis is right on. Daumantas, if there <i>is</i> some kind of secret or tell in play here, I hope you'll tell me (perhaps afterwards, if not now)!<br/><br/><br/>Willow,<br/><br/>Interesting, thanks! Just for kicks, can you outline what a tactical plan for Italy in 1910 might have looked like with a unit in the Aegean? The reason I was hesitant to do so is because I knew I needed to gain an SC somewhere just in order to maintain the strength needed to survive. I would be disbanding two units after that retreat (Fall 1910), and had every reason to expect to disband yet another in the following year (1911: there wasn't any way I was going to hold Vienna, after all).<br/><br/>I certainly do see the value of a unit behind enemy lines in theory, but in that particular situation? The only unit I could count on supporting was Army Albania, and Daumantas could easily have countered anything I could do with those units by ordering a very sensible and predictable set of moves like this:<br/><br/>Build Army Smyrna;<br/>Bul S Gre<br/>A Smy -&gt; Con<br/>F BLA -&gt; Con<br/><br/>...and then just wait until I'm forced to disband that fleet at the end of the following year (when I lose Vienna).<br/><br/>So, the possible gains? I don't really see any likely gains. The risks? To mount any kind of potential offensive from my Fleet Aegean, I would have had to disband either Venice or one of my other fleets. Either way, I would be very likely to lose yet another SC in very short order. (Remember that Bill was clearly not on my side at that time, and even if he had agreed to support me into Greece, I would still likely lose Venice and Vienna that very same term, and Daumantas had a number of possible defenses against that maneuver, as well.)<br/><br/>So, that's why I decided to retreat to the Adriatic: it allowed me to take Trieste (gaining an SC) and thereby stay alive a little longer. <br/><br/>Daumantas and Willow, if you don't mind humouring me for the sake of education, can you see a different scenario in that situation? What does it look like?<br/><br/>(Also, since this is the Internet, after all: I'm not trying to be argumentative, just looking to learn, and curious how you might have dealt with that situation from your end!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312375/#Comment_312375" name="Item_805" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-13T10:11:44+00:00" title="February 13, 2011 10:11AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heading into Spring 1915:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-small-23527-28-O.png"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312376/#Comment_312376" name="Item_806" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-13T10:18:12+00:00" title="February 13, 2011 10:18AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Russia builds an army in Warsaw, signaling both a possible de-escalation in Turkish relations and the intent to go head to head with the British ground forces building strength on the continent.<br/>Turkey builds a fleet in Smyrna, a similarly conciliatory act relative to Russia.  <br/>Italy disbands the Adriatic fleet, thus maintaining the ability to defend Rome and Naples, at least for a while.<br/>French troops in Marseilles mutiny over lack of pay, 14 years of war, and a desire to lay on the beach.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312377/#Comment_312377" name="Item_807" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-13T10:27:27+00:00" title="February 13, 2011 10:27AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 13, 2011 10:27AM by Mel_White.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For France, the loss of the Marseilles army leaves southern France open to a possible Turkish or Russian invasion.

As has been discussed, should the west fail in an attack on the east, the default outcome is pretty much that England and Turkey are forced to split France between themselves at their convenience. With these stakes the security offered by a single army in Brest is negligible.<br/><br/>Following that train of thought, the English forces will support the retaking of Munich and liberation of Tunis, and I'd also like to bring more fleets to the Mediterranean from the Atlantic. Ideally the French fleet in Spain will also move Spa-GoL quickly; we need at least material parity in the Mediterranean, or the Turk simply runs over us no matter what we do. As discussed earlier, I gave it a 87% likelyhood that both Rome and Naples fall to Turkey even with A Mar - without it we'll need to take the southern situation seriously indeed. Take note of the possibility of Tyr-Pie-Mar this year; France needs to bring an army south to Marseilles in the fall, at which point there's ideally a fleet in GoL to support the advance.<br/><br/>As for Italy, it's a difficult situation. The best play I can think of is to convince Turkey that it's in his best interests to allow Italy to retreat to Rom-Nap and hold there indefinitely; should Turkey choose to prevent this and seize the positions himself, there's not much Italy can do to confound him. This might make sense from a Turkish viewpoint simply because he can calculate the tactical situation as well as anybody else, and thus see how the area in question is going to be the furthest extent of his line anyway. By leaving Italy alive in a conclave between the Great Powers he can mobilize marginally quicker on some secondary objectives without really compromising his defensive arrangement, as Italy can be counted on to simply hold in Rom-Nap as long as it takes for the storm to pass. Besides, Italy in those positions with fleets only does not have a credible assault on Venice or other Turkish SCs, anyway. The difficult part is to convince Turkey that Ven-Pie or Apu S Tun-Ion are truly so much more useful moves for him that this arrangement is worthwhile. Speaking for myself, I would consider Ven-Pie seriously as the Turk, but I'd have to look at the map with care to figure out whether I would take it or not - basically depends on what I'd expect to happen in the naval war in 2-3 years, as well as the utility of having Russia take Piedmont, instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312387/#Comment_312387" name="Item_809" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-13T13:31:53+00:00" title="February 13, 2011  1:31PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The French are most welcome in Tunis, whose locals are smarting under Turkish pirate oppression.<br/><br/>Surely your troops have some relatives on vacation there, in any case?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312404/#Comment_312404" name="Item_810" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-14T03:07:57+00:00" title="February 14, 2011  3:07AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Willow,<br/><br/>Two things.<br/><br/>Firstly, the endgame is nigh, and as such, I probably won't be needing that fleet in the Bla - mostly there to make you not even think about building fleets, and I don't think you'll be doing that either way now. It's removal would allow you to retreat all those armies at my borders, correct? Seems like you might need vast land power superiority sooner rather than later, thus disallowing England to establish a foothold on the coasts of Russia.<br/><br/>Second - upon review, you botched the orders last time. A Tyrolia S A Trieste- Adriatic? Normally, I'd be more than happy to suspect foul play, but in this case, if the orders fell through, you'd be on the receiving end of it - losing Trieste. Do you perhaps have some kind of an eyesight problem? I wouldn't even ask, but this sort of thing... might just matter in the coming years.<br/><br/>What I say to Mel below also matters to you, by the way! Give it a look.<br/><br/>Mel,<br/><br/>I thought long and hard about how to provide a more reasonable route for you than your current one - which is basically supporting and hoping to be supported by a power you know might turn on you any minute. I think there is one such way, even if it is a bit of a longshot...<br/><br/>England must fall!<br/><br/>Sure, it is a bit of a longshot, but I think it would provide everyone involved a more natural system of expectations and ways of balancing other powers.<br/><br/>The plan is basically such - France puts fleets in the western side of the map, harassing England, perhaps swiping a home SC, with the eventual goal of moving to Norway or the Barents Sea, dislodging StP. In the meantime, Russia would put pressure on England so that it would not be able to gain any more supply centers (thus giving France some room to manouver). Turkey's job would be to use the fleet at her disposal to cover French lands, and help the French fleets offensivelly when in position to do so.<br/><br/>You, of course, face a risk - what if Turkey turns on you? However, doing so would signal quite clearly to everyone on the board, including Russia, that Turkey is trying to go for a solo - I would imagine you could expect English support to counter such movements as well. Similarly, you could expect Turkish support in case of a russian breakthrough, even though it now seems rather unlikely. Plus, given the valuable service you would be providing both of the other countries, why would they choose to provide you with counterincentives to it?<br/><br/>The gains of this plan are modest, but they are there - firstly, a bit more clarity of the grand scheme of things (everyone against the most powerful player on the board!). Secondly - and this is the reason why you could expect me to commit to this endgame plan rather than another version of a three-way draw - there is a certain reputational advantage to making it to the end of a draw with Eero not in it... As well as a certain giddiness, which I'm not sure you've experienced, but I certainly do treasure, of seeing a fairly crazy plan in action. I giggle like a little girl sometimes, I kid you not!<br/><br/><br/>Paul,<br/><br/>I don't feel like I have any insight to the workings of your brain, so if it seems like I do, it's probably the results of one of these, in descending order:<br/><br/>1) Making as sure as I can that, whatever happens, my position will be at least as good as it was for all reasonable sets of moves the opponent may enter.<br/>2) Guesswork - "I did that last time, so I'll do THIS this time instead!" or "I changed what I did every season now. He won't expect it if I keep doing the same thing again!"<br/>3) You are, and I hope you do not take offense of me saying so, green - you reliably take good advice when given such (advice your opponent knows you're going to take is bad advice, in case of tactical issues at least), and make strange goofs with your orders every once in a while.<br/>4) Lady luck's kisses.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312407/#Comment_312407" name="Item_811" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-14T04:47:28+00:00" title="February 14, 2011  4:47AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DWeird</cite>Do you perhaps have some kind of an eyesight problem?

My view point has shifted somewhat since then, in light of Russia's apparent unwillingness to direct action against England.  Even now, Russian actions are directed against France rather than the English.  The recruitment of an army in Warsaw is perhaps the signal of a change in policy in Moscow.  Yet I fear it is too little, too late.  In any event, France must reclaim Munich--it is a matter of pride.  Russia's actions in support or opposition of this effort will greatly inform our own future decision-making.  Also, while I have no doubt of England's long term commitment to the current era of Franco-English unity, I am hopeful that in the short-term we are more useful as a partner than as an enemy.  Admittedly, French survival depends upon being useful. <br/>Finally, the Sultan's plan simply exchanges one problem set for another.  It is just as dangerous a course of action to leave French territory at the mercy of Turkish forbearance as it is to leave similar territory at English mercy.  I strongly urged you to reach an accord with Italy to allow your combined forces to move west.  In France's hour of need, you rejected our broken arrow.  Paradoxically, it is the English who both brought France to the brink and pulled us back.  <br/>As an alternative to your course of action I suggest another.  Take advantage of Russia's vulnerable position between England and your own territory in order to weaken Russia's position. To fight England, Turkey must go through France; similarly, to fight Turkey, England must do so as well.  We are all in contact with Russian forces now and therefore can apply incessant pressure at all points.  In the long run, with balanced ground and naval strength, Turkey and France can counterweigh any future English attempts at European hegemony.  Thus will peace be established again in Europe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312429/#Comment_312429" name="Item_814" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-14T07:36:19+00:00" title="February 14, 2011  7:36AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Surely your troops have some relatives on vacation there, in any case?</blockquote>\nI believe the former Marseilles army can now be found in Tunisian bars, brothels, and beaches.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312442/#Comment_312442" name="Item_815" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-14T09:34:59+00:00" title="February 14, 2011  9:34AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 14, 2011 9:35AM by Mel_White.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Spring 1915, pending retreats<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-small-23527-28-R.png"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312444/#Comment_312444" name="Item_816" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-14T09:37:21+00:00" title="February 14, 2011  9:37AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A stunning turnabout in Anglo-French relations!

I admit that I might attack France if it were tactically likely for me to accomplish total dominance in the west without losing any position against the Juggernaut, but this is not tactically realistic: I can't hold the Turk back without your fleet support in the Mediterranean, and I can't hold the Russian back in Central Europe without French aid. I say with no second thoughts that the best, most straightforward French victory plan at the moment is to not try to get cute, but to rather crush Russia decisively - Turkey will join in once our commitment is tactically obvious, and Russia hardly can defend against all three of us at once.<br/><br/>Speaking of next turns tactics: I'd have liked to see you in GoL at this point, as we could've attacked the Tyrhenian Sea. As it is, we have little to do but to shore up positions; I'll support Tunisia in place and move a second fleet to NAf, while I hope you'll move to Mar and GoL to complete the southern line for us. Up north, meanwhile, we should push against Russia a bit; it's difficult to coordinate without giving away the exact plan, so perhaps we'll try a blind play in the hopes of second-guessing Russia?<br/><br/>Willow: as you can see, the western alliance is working reasonably well, and while Turkey is more or less impregnable against us (except in the very longest term of carefully conducted trench warfare), the same is not true of Russia. I suggest that you consider carefully the advantages of turning against your ally in a decisive lightning attack that'll provide you with both a superior position and material advantage. It is the well-known long-term commitment of his majesty's government that we will, upon seeing evidence of resumed hostilities between Russia and Turkey, withdraw any offensive elements of our own army from Russian borders to support our eastern friends in their time of trial. Consider this well, for the stakes at the moment are as yet relatively minor: if the wind shifts this coming turn and we normalize our relations next spring, then no major hazard to Russian lands has occurred; the situation in just a year or two will be completely different as the amount of pressure on Warsaw and other outlying Russian SCs increases - in that situation the Czarinna will surely find it difficult to relax her defense against the west at all to conduct the necessary southern operations, which effectively means that this current option will be out of your hands, possibly permanently. I personally find the risk of an entrenched war against Russia and France justified for Russia only if you are certain that you are tactically capable of stopping us; a diplomatic solution is unlikely once everybody's forces have advanced over the point of no return, especially when you consider that the easiest draw of the game still excludes France: whatever else happens, I find it unlikely that the French leaders will desist from this war when they know that Russia's death - and only Russia's death - will automatically bring about their own victory on this board.<br/><br/>Daumantas: I do not scorn your diplomatic stance, as it remains a fact that the safest and most straightforward Turkish draw involves decimating France, ideally by engaging French and English forces in a war amongst themselves. I promise you that should the French prove faithless I will join you in dealing a quick and decisive three-player draw on the board. Meanwhile, however, tread carefully: your position is second-strongest, it's true, but should the Russian and French forces find concord and decide to turn on you, I will not interfere, and I fully expect that the two will be capable of reducing your lines to chaos with a mere couple of years of warfare. Should you be caught unawares, the situation will be possibly the most favourable of all for myself while being the most perilous for you. I'm sure you will find sticking with the Juggernaut your safest choice, and the one that least requires any initiative, but it also remains a fact that a quick and decisive attack on the Russian would all but guarantee your position on the board: gaining the tactical upper hand could give you a position comparative to mine insofar as tactical invulnerability goes. Also, the fact remains that the French will be happy to kill whoever seems the weakest among the eastern Powers, so directing him against the Russians will be much easier if you take the initiative yourself.<br/><br/>Paul: Seems like we can do little for you, especially as the French forces remain tardy about advancing. A shame.<br/><br/>Considering the above viewpoints overall, it seems that my strategy is clear: put pressure on Russia, support a French advance towards the east and see how long the Juggernaut lasts. I'm confident that our forces are better positioned and led (assuming the French tardiness in execution lessens over time), so it's only a matter of time before Russia finds her own survival dependent on serious negotiation with the western forces. After that matters depend greatly on who stabbed who first, and how much advance the western forces gain before the Juggernaut falls.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312503/#Comment_312503" name="Item_818" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-14T12:59:56+00:00" title="February 14, 2011 12:59PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah!

This is not surprising; I at least personally believe that three-way draw is the default outcome of Calhamer Diplomacy, with soloing being a glorious exception that only comes about due to cardinal mistakes by the opposition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312536/#Comment_312536" name="Item_821" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-14T16:02:15+00:00" title="February 14, 2011  4:02PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, that is what I meant by "semi-finals":<br/><br/>Once some combination of factors leads to one of the four of you being eliminated, then there is a chance for a further stage of the game leading to an attempt at a solo victory. <br/><br/>So, we may be looking at the finals, but the committe may decide later to host yet another, final "elimination round".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312539/#Comment_312539" name="Item_822" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-14T16:07:52+00:00" title="February 14, 2011  4:07PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Incidentally, I'll be curious to hear afterwards everyone's thoughts on the open diplomacy environment.

After all, the success of "corner powers" is much less dependent on negotiation and diplomacy than that of the central powers: Germany, Italy, and Austria all floundered quite early in the proceedings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312569/#Comment_312569" name="Item_823" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-14T18:52:44+00:00" title="February 14, 2011  6:52PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>This is the finals, Paul - you were the semifinals sacrificial lamb.

We see again that the mighty pressures of trust and realpolitic surround and subsume the game of Diplomacy, and the iron logic of looking out for number one shits lumps at the noblest intents, noblest Powers. Drama!<br/><br/>Mel: very nice moves, I especially like what you did with Tun - well guessed! As you left Marseilles free to build, I suggest that you build armies in both Mar and Par; a fleet in Marseilles is something I considered as well, but the truth is that we have a heavy enough fleet mix, and getting armies to Piedmont-Tuscany area as soon as possible is a big military priority, considering how the fate of Italy is on re-bound here. Let's talk more about tactical detail later in the spring, but for now I'll say that I'm happy with our cooperation so far, and will be delighted to ensure that you get a good grip on the environs of Switzerland; that'll be useful, no matter what happens with the Turk. Also, let's talk about convoying Gascony; that might be the quickest way of getting forces to the front.<br/><br/>Willow: I will, of course, gladly follow the established treaties with the Russian Czardom. Do your best against the Turk, I say. I'll establish a solid defensive perimeter for the west in Germany, but will retreat English troops from the Pru-Tyr line.<br/><br/>Daumantas: Good luck against your nemesis - disband well! Russia can take both Constantinople and Serbia by force next year, it seems to me, so you'll need suberb tactics here. Also note that you owe me Italy and France now, so feel free to pay up whenever you're ready.<br/><br/>Paul: were I you, I'd start negotiating for peace with Turkey vigorously. The Turk can disband two units now, and if he'll remove eg. F Tyr and A Nap, he'll be left with the units that are actually able to reconfigure against Russia, while he'll lose most of the pressure on his western flank. We'll happily help you regain Naples from the Turk either way, so one might think that the best solution for Turkey is to leave the Italian peninsula well enough alone and establish a less ambitious defensive line further east. Regaining Naples will give you some flexibility, and at that point you might be able to join forces with Turkey against Russia to retake Venice as well. Much depends on your French allies, of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312990/#Comment_312990" name="Item_831" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-16T23:16:38+00:00" title="February 16, 2011 11:16PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 16, 2011 11:17PM by DWeird.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lessons learned:<br/><br/>You can't make someone your ally if they don't want to - don't think I could have done anything more to prove my good intentions to Russia, and now we have this.<br/><br/>Second, you *can* make someone begrudgingly acquisce to your demands as long as you hold them by the throat, which is apparently the state that Russia has been during all this time.<br/><br/>Third, never, ever eliminate the possibility of a backup plan.<br/><br/><br/>Anyway!

Mel, check me on this: Mun-Tyr, Bur-Mun, Ruh S Bur-Mun, Mar-Pie, Spa-GoL, Tun-Ion, Tyr S Tun-Ion, Wes-Tun. (Not trying to dictate, just painting an overall picture.) I figure that we want to get you into Naples this year while I take Tunis (temporarily, perhaps - mostly want a build, not possession), and next year we can proceed all the way to the eastern Med area. Meanwhile we'll get you a solid beachhead east of Switzerland, which will be invaluable if/when we need to stop a Russian solo in the last turns of the game - and it doesn't hurt for general influence in northern Italy, of course. Let me know if my thinking is out of line. (Note that Mun-Tyr is not a problem for Russia, as she knows about it and can account for it in her moves; business as usual.)<br/><br/>Also, Mel: are you cool with secret maneuvers? I think I have a few ideas to give us decisive advantage, but I can't tell you about them without forewarning our eastern colleagues. The play I have in mind might seem a bit bad from your side if we don't discuss it ahead of time, so I won't try it unless you'll tell me you're OK with a secret surprise move that'll benefit us both. (If you can guess what I'm talking about, that's probably it, at least in part.)

I find any other outcome highly unlikely.<br/><br/>The perils surrounding a tie are the continued survival of Paul and Daumantas, and the risk of a solo by either of the major powers on the board.<br/><br/>I do not believe that I can solo with the current unit positions; supposing Russia were to capture all of Turkey and the Balkans, that leaves me with 13 units; a strike on Venice is likely, but even possession of say, all the Italian centers leaves me with 16, and my fleetless strategy renders me impotent in striking at Tunis; the Piedmont line is fairly defensible, and St. Petersburg is impregnable.  The weak link here is the Mun/Ber line; if France and England hold this, there is no real threat of a Russian solo.<br/><br/>The English solo, on the other hand, is a much more viable possibility- a likely stab for Eero would net him Brest, Portugal, and perhaps Munich, for 14 centers, and put Paris, Spain, or Tunis in striking distance.  Eero's sheer freedom to act here is impressive, with all of the aforementioned centers, as well as the Italian peninsula, and possibly Russian home centers.<br/>I think it would be in Eero's interest to prove he's not aiming for a solo by voluntarily ceding some ground to France and actually aiming for a disband, to get rid of some armies camped out in the German line, and focus on a fleet based defense of Germany, which cannot be countered by the Russian units, but is less of a threat to the French.<br/><br/>Really, the three of us should be coordinating at this point; the issue of which great power will fall has been decided (as will be implemented this year).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313275/#Comment_313275" name="Item_834" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-18T16:29:37+00:00" title="February 18, 2011  4:29PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting times.<br/><br/>I'm not in any position to negotiate with anyone, but I can say two things:<br/><br/>First, Daumantas, as far as I'm concerned keeping Turkey alive is a good thing for me, so if you can allow me to regain a few units, I'm not unlikely to put them to use in your favour.<br/><br/>Second, I would by far prefer to see France and England move into Venice and allow me to reclaim Naples, since I can do nothing about Venice.

Any surprises would be unpleasant.  The French builds of the past year were explicitly to signal the lack of any hidden designs for a move against England while allowing for the defense of Portugal, Spain, and Brest.  If you wish to surprise Turkey, Russia, or Italy; be my guest.  We French do not like surprises.  It either means bad news or a birthday.  <br/><br/>If Daumantas is serious about supporting continued English expansion then you may as well make an effort to the Ionian and Naples this season.  I will certainly be willing to trade Tunis in the future for Naples, once Rome's security is assured.  I would like to divest of Tunis, since I cannot afford the units to defend it in light of your naval superiority.  <br/><br/>I would like to begin seeing some English naval movement away from the MAO and English Channel.

Plus, Turkish signaling had to be weighed against the reality of Franco-English cooperation and the western message that the first of the eastern powers to defect from the Juggernaut would wind up with an advantage, if not a position in the draw.  You will recall, no doubt, that this is a very similar message England sent to France and Germany during the period of Franco-German harmony.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DWeird</cite><br/>Second, you *can* make someone begrudgingly acquisce to your demands as long as you hold them by the throat, which is apparently the state that Russia has been during all this time.<br/></blockquote>\nTrue enough.

           Global tensions are high and rising even in the face of Turkey's waning strength as the remaining powers recognize England's geo-political dominance.  Intelligence services struggle to find clear signals of England's initiation of the final phase of a plan for European hegemony.  Even now, Moscow or Warsaw lie at risk to English occupation if the Russian defenders cannot successfully identify England's main effort--if the attack comes. The question is, will it?  England has pulled off some high risk maneuvers so far in this long war; a successful attack on a key Russian supply center now could unhinge the complete Russian defenses.  The risk to England is that, successful or not, the attack on Russia once again forces a Russo-Turkish arrangement to work together.  Most analysts concede that this risk is very low.  The Sultan has made clear he has no intentions of cooperating with the Czarina ever again.  Plus, with English fleets in the Mediterranean in good strength, Turkey would face a difficult test of its own.  The second risk England faces with an attack on Russia is that such an attack would strengthen Franco-Russian relations.  England's freedom of action to maneuver against Russia is partly due to cooperation with France.  France would certainly act in its own best interests to prevent a sole power from European dominance--assuming France could do so.  The implication for England is that the final phase for dominance would likely have to be executed simultaneously against France and Russia, counting on surprise and momentum to carry the offensive through to complete success.  Even now, England could strip Portugal, Tunis, Munich and Spain from an unwary France.  Added to either Warsaw or Moscow, and England's domination would be near complete.  Although French operations have been described as slow or tardy, it is this reality that forces the French general staff to continually look over their shoulders.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313435/#Comment_313435" name="Item_849" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-20T12:44:29+00:00" title="February 20, 2011 12:44PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2011 12:45PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like Pie-Ven, too, if Russia's in favor. Not that I have votes in the Venetian Republic like you guys. There is a slim chance that Russia would find it favourable to ensure Pie-Ven without any intent to support it (either to set up for taking the place himself as Turkey loses interest in defending the impossible position, or because she wants to see a cut for possible support against Trieste), though, but that's pretty much pure tactics, and may be evaluated by everybody easily enough for themselves, especially as I'm a bit concerned with the real world at the moment.<br/><br/>Also, don't worry overmuch about your tardiness, Mel - I'm not overly concerned at this stage of the game, as both the Russians and the Turk seem relatively cowed. A couple of turns back it was an open question whether they might mount a spirited attack west; especially Turkey was in position to genuinely dominate the western Med. As things stand I'm not nearly as worried, especially if you really do get into Venice. The main concern at this point is that there is a very small defensive position in the southern Turkish holdings that is impossible to take without fleet support, which means that we can't entirely stop operating in the area, no matter how clear the situation, unless Turkey outright gives up and suicides.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313446/#Comment_313446" name="Item_850" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-20T15:55:45+00:00" title="February 20, 2011  3:55PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>he main concern at this point is that there is a very small defensive position in the southern Turkish holdings that is impossible to take without fleet support, which means that we can't entirely stop operating in the area, no matter how clear the situation, unless Turkey outright gives up and suicides.</blockquote>\nCan you explain this, Eero?<br/><br/>It seems to me that those fleets won't be able to hold more than one or two SCs, at which point, if the war goes against Turkey, one or two of them will have to disband.

The English crown is, and has always been, a friend to small animals; both Italian and Turkish nations have their best shot at liberty in playing hardball, looking out for number one and establishing themselves on their own national soil while the larger Powers fight for the balance of Powers in Europe. After all, it's not the small 2-SC Power that is at fault if Europe slides into a hegemony, they have plenty of problems on their own. Better for Turkey and Italy to negotiate hard, establish viable states for themselves once more and hope that the large Powers with actual strength to spare deal with their problems. If they do, then Italy and Turkey are once more in the game, and if they don't, then the loss is not any greater for the small Powers doomed to lose anyway. Neither Paul nor Daumantas can claim that I'd have ever had any sort of ambitions towards their presence on the board, after all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313542/#Comment_313542" name="Item_854" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-21T13:39:56+00:00" title="February 21, 2011  1:39PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Out of academic interest, and because it's really fun to be a small Power in a situation like this, let's see what I'd do in their stead...<br/><br/>Italy: the price of Italian cooperation would have to be Venice, of course; France disbands in Venice and leaves the place empty. Italy builds an army, claims Venice and the Ionian Sea next year. After that a fleet build and Greece; the second fleet deigns to move west. The first fleet holds in Greece indefinitely as a bulwark against further imperial ambitions, while the Venice army supports the Grand Alliance. Italy amasses fleets to take Tunis and southern France. The outcome is that should the Hegemony be averted, Italy will have a viable small Power with its defensive linchpins in Venice, Greece and Tunis in place, and a real option at expanding west. I wouldn't push any further east as Italy here, as Russia needs to be able to not worry about it. France dies in the crossfire, but that's not Italy's problem.<br/><br/>Turkey: the premise in Turkey would be more difficult; nothing more or less than a total Russian retreat from Anatolia and Bulgaria. I rather doubt that Russia will go for this, but as the alternative is to suffer an absolutely crippling raider presence on the Balkans, it might be worthwhile at least temporarily - and of course I would do my best to convince Russia that it is, were I the Turk. Either way, Turkey has to keep the armies, I expect, as it'd be too easy for Russia to go back on her word without them. In the spring Turkey would basically start moving his own forces towards Anatolia while Russia races north. Greece falls to Italy, most likely, but that doesn't matter as the Turkish armies end the year in Serbia and Bulgaria (or perhaps Budapest and Greece or something like that if Russia tries to betray Turkey). Second year will end in Bulgaria and Constantinople, and only after the third year will Turkey be able to build. The Turkish location does not allow him to project force against the Hegemony, so it might be that the Turk would have to accept that Russia only gives him his home SCs in Anatolia and retains Bulgaria; Turkey wouldn't have any prospects for advance, except perhaps by keeping Greece after all (I wouldn't accept that as Italy, but whatever), as his job in the Alliance would mostly consist of sitting tight and not bothering Russia. The key to long-term survival for Turkey in this situation would basically be to wait and see and stab Russia at the perfect moment: not too soon to swing the war for the Hegemony, but not so late that the threat of Hegemony has completely passed. (If Turkey leaves it too late, Russia can just turn and crush him; likewise if England has already given up on the solo at that point.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313547/#Comment_313547" name="Item_855" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-21T14:13:14+00:00" title="February 21, 2011  2:13PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thinking about any kind of Grand Alliance:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>the price of Italian cooperation would have to be Venice, of course; France disbands in Venice and leaves the place empty.</blockquote>\nEero beat me to it! <br/><br/>My cooperation requires the return of my duly deserved territories.

The only leverage Turkey has here is the power to raid the Balkans and tie up incommensurate numbers of Russian troops unless Russia gives him a deal; giving up that leverage for promises at this late stage is not a working deal.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Russia needs to be able to believe that Turkey can be worked with, and that depends on whether the Sultan is willing to still go for victory over revenge. To me it seems that the demand Daumantas made is not berserk-crazy although it might seem snide on the outside: he's not saying that he wants Russia to relinquish the entire Balkans, but only that he wants demilitarization in the area. I have no doubt that Turkey will try something at some point, but it's in his own best interest to not tax the Russian economy too much by expanding greedily while Russia sets up lines against the Hegemony. In this regard I find him pretty reasonable: indeed, Russia should move all forces quickly north and leave the Balkans and Anatolia to Turkey, trusting that the Turk won't take more than he needs off the bounty!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313601/#Comment_313601" name="Item_859" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-22T05:09:05+00:00" title="February 22, 2011  5:09AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh, like I could possibly take more than I need with two units and no chance to build!<br/><br/>S'not revenge. I don't have anything against Russia or Willow personally - just making good on my earlier threat. Given that my eventual survival seems rather questionable, the only choice I get is between supporting two versions of an endgame - one in which a power that attacked me after I outlined quite clearly why that is a bad idea takes part, and one in which it doesn't. It's not that much of a choice, but it's there!<br/><br/>All Russia has to do to change my chosen course of action is give me a good chance to survive until the endgame. Doesn't have to be surefire - nobody can guarantee that, I know. It does, however, have to be the best that Russia can do for Turkey. Can't be that hard, can it?<br/><br/>In short - if I see a good deal, I'll take it and keep to it.

One strong enough that it had a chance of surviving until a potential draw.<br/><br/>So, as I see it (looking at it with first-time player glasses), we're in a kind of funny position. The would-be partners in a draw (particularly France and Russia) would probably rather just see us gone, but can they afford to take the time to wipe us out? They risk a solo victory, in that case. So simply wiping us out is a risky venture, as it gives the initiative of the war to England.<br/><br/>The ideal situation, of course, would be to convince us of the need for a Grand Alliance and hope we meekly do the bidding of the bigger powers. But that relies on a lot of naivete on our part, as far as I can see.<br/><br/>Convincing us both to get on-board with a Grand Alliance, more realistically, requires some fairly convincing argument for our continued survival (what happens if the board returns to a likely three-way draw state? How can the smaller powers regain enough strength to have a fighting chance under those conditions?). I suppose that would require Italian and Turkish gains at the same rate as those new units support existing Russian and French armies (so effectively some fraction of French and Russian troops at the front becomes replaced with Italian and/or Turkish mercenaries).<br/><br/>I'd love to hear what Mel and Willow are thinking right now, and what their options are. Since Eero is likely more interested in keeping us alive than not (more chances for something to get screwed up, this way, especially with open diplomacy), Turkey is probably much easier to simply (and quickly) dismantle than Italy, but that could change if Eero suddenly abandons the Mediterranean.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313923/#Comment_313923" name="Item_865" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-23T11:34:08+00:00" title="February 23, 2011 11:34AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mel, I will defer to your wishes: Tyr S Boh-Mun (to make sure the center stays French), or Boh/Bur S Tyr-Mun (to get more units in the fight in Germany)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314026/#Comment_314026" name="Item_866" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-23T17:59:13+00:00" title="February 23, 2011  5:59PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daumantas,<br/><br/>I'm rather confused by your choice of disbands.

On the moral front, of course, one might argue that the Turk did exactly what the Russians requested, and therefore the Russian should leave the Turk alive to use his fleets against England like she promised - now we'll get to see the true depth of the Russian moral pretensions!<br/><br/>You could still try for Greece with two units, although it's likely not going to go so well. Perhaps success is more likely for Italy in negotiating with Russia for access to Greece and maybe even Trieste next year; Russia might go for it due to her limited ability to use the builds herself, and it'd go a long way towards improving Italy's chances of sneaking into the draw. I would, of course, personally hope that our friends in Italy would use any such special opportunity to grow into a true contender responsibly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314041/#Comment_314041" name="Item_868" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-23T19:40:32+00:00" title="February 23, 2011  7:40PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mel, not having heard from you, I'll be ordering S Boh-Mun.<br/><br/>Think about Belgium- it may be worth it to pondering moving there- it makes the attack on Munich uncertain, but if Eero's uncertain about where he can land his London army, so much the better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_314069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314069/#Comment_314069" name="Item_869" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-24T00:09:39+00:00" title="February 24, 2011 12:09AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2011 12:15AM by DWeird.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ayup!

How you play a losing position is the measure of the man in any game. Besides, there's plenty of excitement in a minority position in Diplomacy, as you can set yourself up as a pivot between the camps and thus have almost as much say about the outcome as anybody else. "Ride the tiger", as I memorably characterized this a few games back; force the game to the brink of mutual loss by cooperating with the solo candidate and then negotiate concessions from the other losers in exchange for your help in stopping that solo.<br/><br/>Of course this is much trickier if you don't have any leverage on the board <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>. I have great hopes of Paul in this regard, though, as Italy is extremely defensible with even just two armies against a continental assault, making him pretty secure against the enroaching Russian.

I guessed Eero would try to force a disband of Mel's fleet in NAf, but it's a little far from home to be able to leverage any immediate gains out of the situation. <br/><br/>Two surprises, though:<br/><br/>One is that Turkey is still in the running! This reminds me of the other game I'm involved in: it seems mercy has prevailed in Willow's mind.<br/><br/>Two is the cock-up in Silesia. I'm looking forward to an explanation of that one! (If one is forthcoming, that is.)<br/><br/>Italy's future concerns:<br/><br/>In order to help Mel hold up a defense, I may move Venice -&gt; Trieste in the Fall. I do not particularly want to see Turkey destroyed, but taking Venice from Mel by staying in place might be too hard of a blow for France, risking a premature English victory. Yet another disband could be crippling. Daumantas (and/or Willow), would you hold it against me if I did so?<br/><br/>(Edit: D, if you let me into the Ionian, I'd be very happy to support you into Greece. You may have a chance at taking Smyrna or Bulgaria this Fall, so not all hope it lost, but it's a tough situation no matter what. Let me know what you think.)<br/><br/>It seems that either way I'm taking territory from a potential ally, so it'll be a difficult choice to make.

This way Italy could have Trieste and France could keep Venice. However, more than Venice, I'm concerned about the clearly belligerent messages that are issuing from my most traditional ally in Italy - Paul, surely you will not be raising your hand against me when we've lived in peace for so long? You should remember in gratitude how my maneuverings against your enemies pulled you from the brink and preserved your life against utmost hazards, and then when you lied low I refused to take advantage. Shame on the warmonger, shame on the faithless friend! Besides, as things stand you'll need to build another army and claim the Pie-Ven-Tri-Tyr defensive zone out of purely selfish reasons if you're to surpass the French in feasibility as an end-game Power, and therefore win your place in the draw; this is no time for you to start messing in international politics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_314164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314164/#Comment_314164" name="Item_877" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-24T20:12:55+00:00" title="February 24, 2011  8:12PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>I have every faith and all due respect in England and the wisdom of the Imperial Crown.

Daumantas, what do you think?<br/><br/>Another alternative is that I order Apulia S Naples -&gt; Ion, and Rome -&gt; Tyr. Then you choose whether you will support F Rome or attack the Ionian.

There is a very viable stalemate line that runs from Ion-Nap-Rom onwards that I would've found impossible to break had you prioritized holding it and brought an army or two from mainland to support the effort. Letting me into Ionian meant that I could retreat east, and the true meaning of that is not really in random raids but rather in being able to break the Ionian stalemate line at will. I could always stop the Alliance at Tunis, and while I have a fleet east of the Ionian, I could also wage effective war for the Italian SCs.<br/><br/>In practice all this proved to be of secondary importance of course, as I succeeded in taking Munich; I had two reeds in the wind in this regard, as either taking Munich or getting a fleet east of Ion and slowly grinding an SC from Italy were both viable courses of action for me. This particular outcome was much quicker, though. I would only have lost this end-game if I'd both lost Munich and gotten stalemated in the Mediterranean - both very possible outcomes a few turns back, certainly.<br/><br/>Also, somebody post the moves for the audience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315675/#Comment_315675" name="Item_907" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-06T20:10:07+00:00" title="March  6, 2011  8:10PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>It also seems to me that Russia had a shot at St. Petersburg just now, however (not anymore, that opportunity is gone, clearly).

I'll be looking forward to hearing some more of your thoughts on this game.<br/><br/>As I've been trying to learn more about this game, I've been writing out orders for England and Russia (and sometimes France) for the last couple of years. Usually, I guessed pretty close, or sometimes you, Willow, and/or Mel came up with better options than I had considered. But for the Spring of 1919, my scratch pad says "Moscow to Livonia, Warsaw supports; Sevastopol to Moscow, Ukraine supports", and I was surprised not to see it happen. Given your orders for the same year, it looks like it would have cost you St. Petersburg. <br/><br/>It's funny how tactically this game comes down to a lot of guessing and double-guessing!<br/><br/>It's been a lot of fun for me to be a part of this: this being my first game to come to an end (the other one is still very much ongoing, just approaching 1914). Thank you all for inviting me to join in, and for all the very helpful advice and guidance (particularly Bill, whose demise I inadvertently hastened--I wonder if he got all me secret messages?).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315811/#Comment_315811" name="Item_910" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-07T20:06:16+00:00" title="March  7, 2011  8:06PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's all over but the crying now.<br/><br/>Here's a turn by turn recap for me, as Russia:<br/><br/>1901:  My opening was my biggest mistake of the game, hands down.  (Bigger than my many misorders, or the failure to outguess him at the very end.)  My intent was to sneakily attack the Black Sea from the side:  order Arm-Bla, Mos-Rum, Ukr S Mos-Rum in the fall, with Daumantas having to scramble and order Bla-Ank and Con-Smy to cover his centers.  This opening was chosen more for its novelty than any utility, and I feel that I outsmarted myself here- the move to Arm by Daumantas was such an obvious counter, and I'm not sure that the fall moves would even have played out my way if he hadn't ordered it.<br/>Well, that shows why the Armenian attack is not a standard opening in the Diplomacy lexicon.<br/><br/>My second choice of openings, a rather standard Two North, Two South opening, Stp-GoB, Mos-Stp, War-Ukr, Sev-BLA would have netted me Rumania and Sweden and kept Eero out of Norway, and even given me a chance at it in '02.  The entire landscape of the northern campaign would have been different, and indeed the game- the smallest (or not so smallest) of decisions can have sweeping ramifications.  To speculate beyond that is pointless, but I kicked myself over this opening quite frequently.<br/><br/>Early diplomacy was aimed at courting Germany, vilifying England, and trying to court Italy as a long term partner without being too obvious that I wanted to crush Austria and Turkey between the two of us.<br/><br/>Fall '01 was frustrating as I realised just how deep of a hole I had dug for myself.  Turkey getting two builds, one of them Rumania, is just plain terrible for Russia.  The offer of an ersatz Juggernaut, with us moving into the typical positions was genuine.<br/><br/>The build of a fleet up north was an attempt to regain a North/South strategy, but it was too little too late- Eero's seizing of Brest was a definitive early victory, and I didn't have the resources south to support the campaign.<br/><br/>1902<br/><br/>Of course, that was all dependent on German cooperation, and Spring sees him head east.  We see bitter fighting over Rumania and Sevastopol (Russia gets an edge in from a timely Austrian attack, but watch out for that Galician unit), and I lose Sweden to Germany<br/><br/>1903<br/><br/>Turkey offers me a raw deal; my first instinct is to respond with sarcasm and throw it back in his face; but I decide I see an opportunity to deceive him.  Of course, it has to be believable that I would agree to such a deal, and ultimately, it isn't- Daumantas keeps on fighting as I fight him, and makes gains against Austria.  Meanwhile I have Germany and England on my back; it's obvious (to me anyways) that England will come to blows with Germany soon, so I try to cut a deal with Germany: Warsaw for support of St. Petersburg, to set up for a stab of England with him on top.  Alas, it doesn't happen.  I choose to focus my defense on the south, screwing over the person who screwed me the most (that'd be you, Daumantas).<br/><br/>1904<br/><br/>This is the year of no movement, since we had an AWOL player.  <br/><br/>1905<br/><br/>With the fight returned, I manage to hold of the German- fighting defensive wars seems to be what I do best.  And then England stabs Germany.  If only someone, anyone, had seen that coming.<br/>Also, we see some grasping for straws: Russia in Vienna, Austria in Berlin, and Germany in Moscow, a giant circle jerk of invasions.<br/><br/>1906<br/><br/>Eero's stab of the German- and the German's choice to disband Russian occuping units saves me; I'm able to get back into the game, withdrawing to let Austria and Turkey fight it out while I retake my key home centers.  Russia is now right where it was at the start of the game: just my four home centers, though now all occupied with armies.  I won't build another fleet for the entire game- I won't need them in the south, and the north, where I want them, is blocked.<br/><br/>1907<br/><br/>I eagerly throw myself at Austria and Turkey and accomplish nothing.  Would I have been better off keeping Moscow to defend St. Petersburg?  I certainly thought about it.  I end the year at four centers, but St. Petersburg is essentially lost to me forever.  The Bohemian move is interesting because it lets me meddle in German and Austrian affairs, and threaten lots of places.<br/><br/>1908-1912<br/><br/>Mostly though, Bohemia ends up being the leverage to move south: first Galicia, then Budapest.  Russia and Turkey have a working relationship now, countering Austria and Italy.  Both alliances are shaky, with early distrust hindering things, but they are caused by what makes stable alliance in Diplomacy: desperation and need.  I needed to work with Turkey because he had his damn boat right next to my home center, (and in some cases, a unit in Armenia).<br/><br/>This is a period of pretty straightforward play: tactical exercises in cooperation with minimum information exchange.  There is also a larger ongoing strategy of encouraging both Turkey and Italy to invest in fleets (the better to oppose each other and not me).  The possibility of flipping and siding with Italy remains on the back of my mind, but a situation never truly develops- Daumantas has more to offer me.<br/><br/>I had many opportunities in here to stab Daumantas, and vice versa.  In my case though, it was never worth it.  Generally, I could at best make a try for a center or two, but why ruin something good for such little gain?<br/><br/>The other big thread of these years was the northern defense of Moscow against Eero's St. Pete army- I had not one but two Swords of Damocles hanging above my head (the other of course being the Turkish Black Sea fleet).  I used at least one unit every turn protecting my homeland.  The biggest scare was the French attack in '11, but France couldn't afford the units.<br/><br/>1913<br/><br/>My hope here was a lightning assault on the divided French/English line, to take Munich and Berlin in one turn, and get two builds.  With that materiel, I might be able to even get St. Pete back!  Sadly, I aim for both and get neither.<br/><br/>This was also the year of my 'panic stab': seeing Daumantas with three units next to Rumania, I literally panic, and deploy my own unit to Armenia- if I'm getting stabbed, I want to be able to minimize the damage.  He doesn't stab me- just makes a defensive move, really, and everything threatens to fall apart.<br/><br/>1914<br/><br/>But it doesn't, because ultimately, we don't want it to.  I make an overture to Daumantas that's surprisingly honest for diplomacy play- I don't want us to be at war with each other.  I don't want to fight a war I don't know I'll win, and the outcome is just too uncertain for both sides.  So instead I apologize, plead, and deal, and what do you know?  It works.<br/><br/>Do I pull out of Armenia though?  Oh no.  Because I'm not stupid.<br/><br/>1915<br/><br/>Daumantas and I agree to a mutual diarmament, but it favors me quite a bit more than it does him.  So much more in fact, that I see no real reason not to stab him for two centers.<br/><br/>In Diplomacy, alliances end.  They usually end with mutual betrayal, or a one-sided stab.  There are two good stabs- one your target forgives as if it never happened, and one your target never recovers from.<br/><br/>When timing the later, I look for some of the following:<br/>*If I wait, am I likely to get a better opportunity?<br/>*If I wait, is my target likely to be able to defend himself?<br/>*What's the fallout if I do attack?<br/><br/>In this case, Daumantas had very little strategic support to offer me; the status quo was a EFRT quadrangle; either I or France would need to be eliminated, and I didn't like my odds.  Stabbing Daumantas gained me two builds, took two key centers, and he had little ability to effectively respond.  Daumantas certainly saw it coming but could not be sure if it would happen or not; going for a bounce and being wrong would have cost him in the battle of the Mediteranean.<br/><br/>1916<br/><br/>This year sees me continue to dismantle Daumantas.  Relations with France are rough- Eero raised the (frankly ridiculous) specter of a Russian solo to garner French aid; uncertainy rules the day in the center.<br/><br/>1917<br/><br/>A snafu over Silesia- if successful, I could have retaken Warsaw a year earlier, and make a more credible attack on St. Petersburg, and prevented Eero from getting enough centers- resulting in probably a EFR or EIR draw.<br/><br/>1918<br/><br/>The whole year was intended to set up an attack on Warsaw, by going the direct route- having keep at it in Silesia, I gambled for the direct attack on Warsaw, seeing that Eero's defenses were weak.<br/><br/>1919<br/><br/>All but over here.  My attack plan for St. Petersburg would have beaten the order set Sil-War, St. P S Liv, Liv S Sil-War, which happens to defeat the theoretical order set posed by Paul.  The game comes down to guess and counter-guess, well played by everyone, new and experienced alike.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315831/#Comment_315831" name="Item_911" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-08T04:12:49+00:00" title="March  8, 2011  4:12AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-23527-37-R.png" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-23527-37-R.png"/></a>A great synopsis, Willow. I have to say that in general I find Russia's game here emblematic of the greatest Diplomacy game that is to be played to a loss; Russia went up and down in the game, got almost killed off, lost all home SCs at least once, but rose to lead the Grand Alliance at the end. A draw was hair's breadth away more than once, and Willow never wavered in victory or defeat - a very moral and uplifting run all around, I find.<br/><br/>For myself, some notes on the early and middle game:<ul><li>I started the game with a straight anti-French play mostly out of whimsy, as is often the case at the start; the Calhamer board is so well-researched that you can play almost anything as long as you're able to do the necessary diplomacy and understand your long-term goals, and here I had a feel that Daniel, playing France, would be my toughest enemy. This would certainly prove to be the truth: he was an extremely tenacious and properly paranoid opponent after I'd disabused him by the double-betrayal over the first year. My strategic goal in wrassling with France from the start was basically to keep this very strong and unkillable Power weak and divided; I could afford to have a difficult relationship to the south as long as France would be so weak that I could force peace when it suited my needs elsewhere. I do not have much experience playing England compared to the eastern Powers, so I'm pretty gratified by the macro-strategic effects of this low-burn French war.</li><li>Much of my diplomacy over time was basically about encouraging my neighbours to commit to a fleet-less build strategy, which proved quite possible - I spent the majority of the game in uncontested control of the Atlantic environs, really, and my end-game was very favourable mostly not because of the position I started in, but rather because nobody else had a serious fleet to contest the western Mediterranean against me.</li><li>I did my best to slow down the progress of the game, meaning that I favoured weaker Powers against the stronger ones and generally did my best to support a stagnated board to offset my own inability to wage quick expansionist wars. The way I relinquished StP in 1905 back to the all but destroyed Russia was emblematic in this regard, as I chose to swing my forces against the then-powerful Germans while Russia gathered strength and kicked back the southern offensive on her soil.</li><li>My tactics were generally very strategy-oriented and less influenced by diplomacy, I find now that I look back on the early moves. As an example of my thinking, much of my northern strategy, tactics and diplomacy was simply predicated early on on the fact that I'd positioned an army in Finland in the spring of 1902: like a fleet on the Black Sea, an army in Finland is a fulcrum around which fleet movements can happen effectively, and thus my decision to take this position basically entailed the outcome of conquering StP and Sweden. Another similar tactical dictum that becomes strategic in my play here is the way I defended and expanded my marine domination by blockading and then conquering enemy harbors in the north while being relatively rather careful about my southern MAO border; for most of the game a serious French push to NAO and the Nordic area was my biggest concern at all levels of play.</li><li>When the German stab went through my own position in the draw was basically certain: the next two-thirds of the game was all about maneuvering for a solo victory, for which purpose I would have to finally break France. My play for the last half of the game can basically be interpreted as an extended flanking maneuver that a fleet-based Power needs for choking France; nothing less will do, considering the insane vitality of the French position.</li></ul>\nRegarding the other Powers, I found Peter's Germany easy to work with, perhaps due to his relative inexperience; Willow and Daniel were entirely right about how that relationship was going to end up early on, though: it seemed to me that Peter didn't have the constructive tools for encouraging me to stay faithful, which left him with little but waiting for the hammer to fall, especially after he'd committed to a difficult eastern war. Willow and Daniel were in comparison infinitely more difficult; despite the fact that the demise of France loomed big in my plans through the entire game while Russia never was my target, both players managed to be equally challenging as partners, bending to my wishes only when external forces were at their height and forced their hand.<br/><br/>Daumantas played a very strong game as Turkey, only falling prey to the merciless end-game logic at the very end; I admired many of his moves, although I would have taken Russia to back of the shed in the middle game myself before finishing Austria if at all possible. Paul and Bill as the weak sisters both showed a lot of admirable fighting spirit, so I found it unfortunate that the spirit was so often directed against the other; had they managed to coordinate better (and they probably would have in a closed environment!), I do not doubt that they would have fared much better with the skills they displayed. In general I have to say that the level of table discipline here made me quite happy, it's a rare treat to get to play a game of Diplomacy where nobody quits in the middle and everybody tries their best to the very end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315832/#Comment_315832" name="Item_912" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-08T04:13:10+00:00" title="March  8, 2011  4:13AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The endgame</b><br/><br/>A few words about the end-game are warranted, as it was the longest part of the game, and the part that had the least amount of chaos and random events. This phase of the game basically started from my viewpoint (a privileged viewpoint as it happens) in 1908 or so, when French betrayal of Germany and the Russian western initiatives made it clear that Germany was finished as a viable Power. At the same time the Juggernaut alliance had pretty much finished Austria, meaning that the Balkans would thence not be the core of a Power but rather a battleground of competing interests out of which the eastern contender would rise: I would have to start moving with cunning, for France, Russia and Turkey easily had sufficient strength between them for the purpose of stopping my Hegemony from rising.<br/><br/>As you all remember, the tact I chose at the time was to browbeat France into a grateful alliance against the east. Russia made this relatively easy for me by acting up <i>very</i> imperially (consider 1912-14 for example, when she operated almost half-dozen armies against German SCs with apparent impunity) and giving strong signals about commitment to the Juggernaut: the more Willow denied my suggestions and demands of anti-Turkish movements, the more obvious it was from the French viewpoint that England would be the natural ally in resisting the forthcoming eastern assault on the west. As I described at the time, the virtual immunity England enjoyed made the situation difficult for France: the only major Power that might expect to get eliminated if the eastern situation developed freely would be France, as Turkey would attack from the south even as England would be able to assist the easterners from the north. In these lights and with the Juggernaut as firm as it was France was left with no options, really.<br/><br/>My second barb was frankly a lot weaker: my main argument for why the Juggernaut would need to break down before the game's end was that the established Anglo-French alliance would necessarily have at least initial tactical supremacy against the Juggernaut, enabling us to crush Russia as the more exposed partner, which would in turn encourage Turkey to turn on her as the situation became clear. This argument was weaker in that considering the situation circa 1915 we would not in my best judgment been able to do what I threatened; obviously Willow thought otherwise, and I understand that the diplomatic history between Russia and Turkey had been difficult, which was probably why she decided to take a pre-emptive strike against Turkey in the fall of 1915. My third barb was also involved here no doubt: I had been arguing since the Russian assault on German soil in 1913 or so that Russia was a credible soloist, which meant that Turkey would need to help me rein her by stabbing her at the right moment; although the moment in question was not even close once we started cooperating with France, the presence of this argument might have made a Turkish stab on the strong Russia more likely.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-23527-24-R.png" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-23527-24-R.png"/></a>With the power of hindsight we can say that Russia should not have attacked west in the early noughties: the extremely aggressive detaching of forces from the Balkans in 1913 (shown in the picture) that directly led to her short-lived possession of Munich had the direct effect of driving France solidly into my arms; so far my attempts at sneaking and cajoling and outright fighting myself into dominance in France had been slow - I had in fact lost my hope of soloing and was just playing the odds at the time - but the major Russian offensive was such a threatening move that France did not have much choice on the matter: the very best outcome would have been that Russia would have overrun the German area, Turkey would have stabbed Russia to balance the equation and then I'd have finished France off. The worst outcome would have been the admittedly nebulous Russian solo. Had Russia chosen a different tack, such as holding in place or even attacking Turkey with Italy as ally, I doubt I could have overcome France in sufficient time to prevent the east from resolving their affairs and presenting me with a draw accompli.<br/><br/>However, Russia did attack, and I did get the French alliance that allowed us to turn up the pressure on the Juggernaut: once the Anglo-French alliance had firmed up the Juggernaut was in a difficult position, and I don't think things could have turned out very differently: Russia could have opted to trust Turkey and fight, of course, but I was very comfortable waiting out the slow war: we could slog it out for a while to see if a tactical upset might allow us to take Warsaw, after all, and as France did not have the capability to stab <i>me</i>, the only issue was really whether the Juggernaut would fall to a Turkish stab or a Russian one. A four-way draw would have been a fantastical prospect, of course: had the Juggernaut proven completely impossible to break via force of arms or betrayal I would have been forced to turn on France in the end myself.<br/><br/>Once Russia turned on Turkey in 1915 the moment of truth for France came up, and I was certain that my good fortune could not continue any longer: once Turkey lost its feasibility as a Power in the Russian stab the correct French play would clearly have been to move to defensive positions against me, thus signalling that France intended to enforce a three-way draw between France, England and Russia. Instead Mel continued to play happily along in our "let's conquer eastern Europe for France" plan; this was not irrational of him in that had one accepted the tactical possibility of a Russian solo, then it would have made sense for me to retain the French alliance as a counter-balance. However, as it happened, the Russian fleet was non-existent and Italy was clinging tenaciously to life, and I had a solid hold on Tunis, which were all points that led me to believe that there was no way for Russia to fight for a solo even if France decided to throw the game her way. Thus my 1916 stabbing France, at which point I really <i>was</i> within reach of a solo victory!<br/><br/>The last three years were purely tactical play, really, although I did my best to keep the small Powers happy and willing to look after their own well-being: as I said at the time, it's no different losing to a draw coalition or a soloist, so a small Power might as well ensure that the price of their cooperation is a true shot at survival. (In case you're wondering: small Powers become more important instead of less near the end because the forces are nigh inevitably balanced between the soloist and the Alliance: even one or two units basically have the capability to throw the situation either way then.) My victories in this small-Power diplomacy were relatively few in that I couldn't get Turkey to preserve the armies that would no doubt have been problematic for Russia while ensuring that nobody had sufficient fleet power in the Mediterranean to oppose me. However, I did convince Italy to build an army in 1916 to go after Venice, and the Alliance never cohered enough for Russia to take a clear leadership role in assigning areas of responsibility and ensuring that tactical goals were met. It's difficult to say without tedious replays, but I'd estimate that had Russia been able to move with full force towards the west from 1916 onwards instead of leaving forces to secure Anatolia the fight for Munich might have ended differently.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-23527-32-R.png" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/games/game-history-23527-32-R.png"/></a>Looking at the situation in the spring of 1917, at the time I was still uncertain about my chances: losing Warsaw was a fait accompli, and retaking Munich was uncertain; my soloing attempt would fail if I could neither break through the Ionian or take and hold Munich. At the time there were still ample fleets in the Med as Turkey had two and Italy could soon build a second one; considering that two fleets could hold the Ionian from the east against the west, I was doubtful of my chances there. As it happened the Alliance had somewhat different tactical priorities from mine, which helped me achieve multiple quick successes: France fell to tactical miscalculations, Italy chose to remove a Turkish fleet instead of claiming Venice and being in position to pressure Marseilles, and up north I was really in sync with Willow, as I outguessed her multiple times in a row regarding the tactical goals of Moscow, protecting Warsaw and setting up to retake Munich. Especially the latter went through spectacularly in the fall of 1918: had the Alliance appreciated the immediate danger War-Sil and Hol-Ruh presented for Munich, they likely could have kept Munich and thus possibly beaten me back. I felt good enough about my read on Willow and my position down south that I went for the kill by keeping position in the spring and finishing up with a forced capture just now.<br/><br/>In summation, I had a lot of fun here, and would like to thank everybody for their patience and fighting spirit. The game was a fight to the end as Diplomacy tends to be when everybody's doing their best. Everybody's play was of good quality and I doubt that I would've done any better in your positions. We have clearly done a lot for the overall quality of the Story Games Diplomacy scene with this series of games <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315853/#Comment_315853" name="Item_913" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-08T07:24:25+00:00" title="March  8, 2011  7:24AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have the memory to recall the whole game in detail, so I'll just give my thoughts on what I do remember.<br/><br/>For most of the early game, I was, first, lucky, and second, did not let any opportunity slip by.<br/><br/>I got a fleet into the Black Sea, which pretty much decided the nature of my Russian relationship early on - there were struggles in the BLA environs, I'd sometimes win and sometimes lose, but my core would remain untouchable while Willow's would remain contested.<br/><br/>More importantly, during all of this early slugging, Italy and Austria kept at each other's throats... And by the time they resolved their differences with, I've done the same with Russia - the net result being that I, during the whole of the game, did not even once have to fight on two fronts at once. Yes, I did have to fight both Bill and Paul at a point, but my units were close enough to support each other if need be, and the two were hampered both by the open diplomacy (an ally is only truly useful in open diplomacy when he can fight against the enemy separatelly of you, it seems), and by other considerations - both each other, and, to Bill, the growing power of Germany.<br/><br/>Around that point that I was feeling pretty good about my long-term prospects, and thought to myself "Hey, crap! I didn't even once think about the other side of the board! What's happening there?"<br/><br/>That was the point at which my anti-Eero campaigning began - it was clear to me that the Scandinavian hump is going to fall to England if there are no fleets present to counter it, and that it would all slowly go downhill from there, with Eero picking off coastal regions and maintaining an unassailable position.<br/><br/>But the powers that mattered did not care all that much - Germany was being cocky about its prospects of expansion and saw an ally rather than a rival in England, and Russia was fighting in the Balkans against me at the time and thought that the whole thing was a ruse (which, honestly enough, it might've half-been - were Russia to invest in northern fleets, she might have kept the Scandinavian hump and I'd possibly have moved into Sev or Moscow when given a chance). I missed a diplomatic opportunity to lay off and let Russia stop England its tracks then, I'd think - for some reason I thought I can fight Russia and convince her of the English threat (which turned out real, at least) at the same time.<br/><br/>After the fall of Germany, my long-term strategy became to muster enough fleets to block off the Med when England comes, which I believed it would eventually... But I was feeling pretty cool about everything as long as France stayed afloat. I kept my options open to maybe moving into Russia sometime (as long as I had the BLA fleet, all I really had to do was to build two armies in Const and Ankara, really), but the grind against Austria and Italy was slow and a good opportunity never came, especially as I knew that Eero would move in as soon as I would, and I didn't want to move against Russia unless I knew I was able to definitelly secure Moscow as well.<br/><br/>And then France took a hit. It was then that I felt a bit panicky, and my, uh, strategic horizons became significantly narrower - the only thing I really cared about was occupying Italy as soon as I could. I wanted to help France at that point, but that involved cooperating with Italy and easing the pressure on her. Possibly another diplomatic/strategic blunder at my part here - I decided France could likely fend off on her own and focused on taking out Italy instead. I never for a moment had any hostile intentions towards France, and tried to hash out terms of an eventual mutual defense, but France was apparently as threatened by the advancing Turkey as she was by England, and took none of it.<br/><br/>I stopped thinking about a Russian attack at that point and did my best to foster a genuine alliance, mostly to make sure that England was not making any more gains up north while I finish up with the Italian business and get my fleets into a position where I could personally make sure England was countered properly. I tried both carrots and sticks of varying sizes and eventually deluded myself into thinking that I convinced Willow we're on the same boat - all the signs were there warning me to be cautious, with misorders on every turn and a conspicious lack of Willow ever actually saying "okay, we're in an alliance now."<br/><br/>France wasn't doing well, though, and the second she let that english fleet into the Med I started thinking of France as a non-entity (which was another mistake - the future dead are not dead yet).<br/><br/>At that point, I was certain I made a compelling case about the DOOM that England stands for. I wanted to do two things: stop England at the north and stop her at the maw of the Med. One of those I could do under my own power, the other had to be done by Willow... But her northern line was patchy at best and wouldn't have survived a prolonged combined English-French attack. So, even though I didn't really need to tactically, I decided to unilaterally move all of my border troops away to free up the Russian armies to bolster the northern line...<br/><br/>And we all know how that went down.<br/><br/>I'm still not sure what Willow was thinking there, in terms of the endgame. I could have been eliminated with little risk from my side, sure, but at that point, France and parts of Russia would be easy pickings too... Unless you believe Eero when he says that he won't hit Russia and France on their backs as soon as they turn on me, but that's just silly. Maaaybe something effective could have been arranged by feeding Italy parts of formerly Turkish soil and letting it build the fleets necessary, but that wasn't even tried.<br/><br/>Willow, I'm honestly confused! Was the presence of the Bla fleet so antagonizing that you just had to eliminate Turkey when the chance arose? Did you think the then near-fleetless France was strong enough to counter an English advance? Was there anything I could have possibly done to keep the kinda-sorta alliance going until the end?<br/><br/><br/>Anyhoo! Good game, I certainly enjoyed it - being a corner power in an open diplomacy environment is certainly relaxing, at least if compared to the regular stuff. A shame I didn't win, of course, but... While a loser is a loser is a loser, at least I can derive a certain bitter smug satisfaction from the fact that I [i]totally called it.[/i]<br/><br/>When we're all toiling away under the English whip, we will at least have the pride of knowing that we fought against this world order! Well, had genuine plans to fight against this world order. Good intentions count for something, right?<br/><br/>Annnd there goes the smugness.<br/><br/>~signed, the Pirates of Sicily.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315938/#Comment_315938" name="Item_914" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-08T15:52:55+00:00" title="March  8, 2011  3:52PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A note about my misorders: they were all genuine.

I was hoping to pound on Italy quickly while Russia and Turkey were at each other's throats, but they reconciled too quickly and I lost my nerve when Willow moved to Galicia. The public diplomacy environment had me wrong-footed, too, and I couldn't get the hang of it. When Italy stabbed me, I knew that I wasn't going to make it to the draw, so I started playing for personal satisfaction rather than with any long-term plan, and ultimately my enemies found me more valuable dead than alive. *Poof* Good-bye Austria.<br/><br/>Still, it was fun, with some tense moments and some wild ups and downs.
