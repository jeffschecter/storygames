I got into pen n paper/tabletop gaming late, just the last four years, and was burnt out on the tactics of D&amp;D 4e. Then I read Fiasco and it changed my life, leading to so many other kindred games. I just finished reading Apocalypse World and I have taken the chapter on MC-ing to heart, both in games and in my professional life (I'm a teacher).<br/><br/>So what game was it that did that to you?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400096/#Comment_400096" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-08T10:09:50+00:00" title="December  8, 2012 10:09AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Over the Edge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400100/#Comment_400100" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-08T11:15:44+00:00" title="December  8, 2012 11:15AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My Life With Master.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400101/#Comment_400101" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-08T11:19:31+00:00" title="December  8, 2012 11:19AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fudge, Nobilis, and Continuum, all within about 6 months of each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400109/#Comment_400109" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-08T12:59:59+00:00" title="December  8, 2012 12:59PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The <i>System Does Matter</i> essay.

Mind blown.  You could pretend to be a warrior or a wizard or an elf or... <br/><br/>Champions wasn't D&amp;D.  By then I was getting tired of some of the ways D&amp;D was doing things.  But it wasn't just not-D&amp;D.  You got rewarded (Disadvantages) for giving the GM and the other players story hooks!  You could decide what your character could do.  There were tactics and <i>story</i> and you could knock an enemy out without killing them!  And then Fantasy Hero and Danger International and other HERO System games came along and cemented it into my head.  <br/><br/>Talisman wasn't overly mind blowing on its own.  But you know how you're in the endgame, and pretty much everyone can throw spells, and everyone is drawing and throwing spells back and forth?  Poof, you're a toad.  Counterspell.  Now <i>you're</i> a toad.  I thought that that spell-throwing minigame was at least as fun as the boring roll-and-move parts that led up to it, so I tried for a few years to design a game based around characters throwing spells at one another.  The mechanics never really gelled for me though, and then a few years later Richard Garfield went and designed...<br/><br/>Magic: the Gathering.  It was about ten times better than whatever I might have ended up designing would have been.  And it was another new genre of game.  There was a universe -- hell, a <i>multiverse!</i> -- in these cards.<br/><br/>Nomic is a game that's all about changing the rules.  Kinda like MtG but different.  Mind thoroughly blown.  Nomic led me to Fluxx, which led me to...<br/><br/>Icehouse.  If you didn't see those brightly colored pyramids and <i>not</i> immediately start designing games with them, I don't want to be your friend anymore. <br/><br/>Primetime Adventures was to me the first kind of game that could generate <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=12467.0" rel="nofollow">Moose in the City</a> as an artifact of play.  It was my intro into this world of dirty commie hippie games.  <br/><br/>Fiasco was awesome.  Mind blown yet  again.  I sat in on a playtest at Andy's house in December of 2008, though I was the sixth out of five.  I was happy enough to just watch anyway.  I knew I was going to want it as soon as I could get it.   (Oh, and <a href="/forums/profile/Andy">@Andy</a>, I'm back in Raleigh in a couple of weeks if you're interested in meeting up.)<br/><br/>Apocalypse World was yet another new way of looking at RPGs.  The players rolling I'd seen before, but it just worked.  Every part of it just <i>worked</i>.  <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/daniel_ream" title="daniel_ream"><img alt="daniel_ream" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/daniel_ream">daniel_ream</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400327/#Comment_400327" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-10T08:03:17+00:00" title="December 10, 2012  8:03AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me it was Amber Diceless, as several of the concepts I love about story games were there in a kind of proto-form.

(I imagine this space would be devoted to Aspects if I'd read Fate before WotG)<br/><br/>Smallville managed to take a license I hated and a style of game I hated even more (PvP) and create one of my favorite games out of it.  It is an amazing piece of genre emulation, and extra credit for being a genre I hadn't seen handled well mechanically.<br/><br/>Tenra Bansho Zero would have utterly crushed my mind if I'd gotten to read it when Andy was originally talking it up on RPG.net, but even a decade+ later it compares excellently with current English game design.<br/><br/>Microscope is also genuinely A New Thing from top to bottom; I find it hard to even talk about it in the context of RPGs.\n<blockquote><br/>I want to say Champions, but not for any positive reason, I'm afraid.

I've actually been having real trouble with that school of game design myself (HERO/Champions is way too crunchy for me, M&amp;M only marginally less so, and Wild Talents looked easier but broke my will to continue around halfway through character creation).  I think Nobilis is the closest thing to that which I actually feel comfortable enough to use, but it's pretty hard to decouple from its setting...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400341/#Comment_400341" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-10T09:27:55+00:00" title="December 10, 2012  9:27AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 10, 2012 11:34AM by AMBayard.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The pattern my mind made on the wall behind me (when it was blown) must be similar to the gooey pattern behind Rickard's head because I would list the same games -- especially DRYH and Polaris.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400346/#Comment_400346" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-10T09:50:25+00:00" title="December 10, 2012  9:50AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Basic D&amp;D (Holmes) - It was a time when I liked board games and had realized that there were good and bad designs, so I was thinking a little more deeply about things but role-playing hadn't entered common awareness as a thing.
