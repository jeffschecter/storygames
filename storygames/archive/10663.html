Although I'm sure something similar has been done before (or maybe I\u2019ve dreamed about it!), I can't stop toying with this idea. Beware it's only a very rough draft, no game has been planned, nor anything more elaborated than the following notes.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE BASICS<br/>\n<br/>\nStats range from 1-10, typically sitting between 3 and 5. Stat rank gives you Skills points, which will work as a Modifier to the Stat. For example, Might 4 gives me 4 Skill points. If I spend 2 points and take Fighting +2, I\u2019d have an effective Fighting rank of 6.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far, I'll be borrowing Monte Cook's character focus categories from World of Darkness for Stats: Might, Intellect, Subterfuge and Spiritual.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe core of the system is:<br/>\n1) when performing a non-resisted action, the player needs to roll under the Skill effective value on a d10 in order to succeed;<br/>\n2) when an opponent is facing the character, he (the opponent) needs to roll over that value to succeed, on a d10.<br/>\n<br/>\nMargin of Success is the number of hits. The premise is: more advanced characters are more effective when their success depends mostly on their own training, and at the same time, they prove to be challenging to beat.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, a character with Mind 5 Investigator +2 would roll 1d10 and try to roll under 7 to succeed at noticing important clues on a crime scene; while a suspect would have to roll over 7 to avoid speaking too much during his interrogation.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn order to make a character's own Skills benefit is opposed checks, I'm in doubt about these two different approaches: (1) use the Skill rank as modifier (not including Stat; so, if your Fighting is +2, that's what you'd add); or (2) use the Skill rank (again, without the Stat) as bonus dice, but you only keep the best result.<br/>\n<br/>\nModifiers would make things more interesting / tense. (Still have to figure those)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Difficulty Dice: keeping it simple, let's use 3 Difficulty Steps - Minor Checks, Significant Checks and Major Checks. As Significant Checks should be the default, you'll be rolling only 1d10 most of the time. For Minor Checks, you roll 2d10 and keep the best result; on the other hand, for Major checks you roll 2d10 and keep the worst result.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 10+ Rule: if, for any reason, your opponent's target-number is 10 or higher, consider that a roll of 10 explodes. Keep the 10 and roll it again, adding the new result to 10.<br/>\n<br/>\nResistance: maybe not the best term, but let's say a character's got [Stat] hit points against Major effects (i.e. lethal damage) and double the Stat against Minor effects (i.e. bashing damage).<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you help me improve it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
