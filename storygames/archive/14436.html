This gives you some flexibility, but can make scheduling tricky: some of my slots this year overlap games I'd like to play by an hour or two, meaning that I lost out of two or three games to play just one.<br/><br/>The tiny local con <a href="http://www.gaspgamer.com/gasp_con/gaspcon.html" rel="nofollow">GaspCon</a> has <a href="http://warhorn.net/gaspcon-xi/schedule/day.php?date=2010-11-13" rel="nofollow">predefined event slots</a> of four hours each, running 9 to 1, 2 to 6, 7 to 11 and midnight to whenever you fall asleep.  So an hour between each game for food and interaction and finding the right table and bathroom and such.  This is good for creating some rigor to the schedule, but is problematic if you have games that might go more or less than four hours (e.g., Fiasco ended early and left us with three hours until the next game slot started.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328219/#Comment_328219" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T11:13:21+00:00" title="June  7, 2011 11:13AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a fan of built-in breaks between game slots.

I never realized how much difference that socializing makes, but the effect seem huge.  Folks are more friendly and open when the games get going, and more cognizant of being part of the group rather than an individual.<br/><br/>As for slot length, 4 hours seems the standard at most cons.  If anything I'd suggest a shorter afternoon slot, to leave more time for socializing.<br/>Something like gaming 9am-1pm, 3pm to 6pm, and 8pm to midnight.  That gives plenty of time for meals, and lets you go do non-gaming from 1pm-8pm if needed.<br/><br/>While I like the thematic element of having a 12am-4am slot, especially for games like Don't Rest Your Head,  I can rarely keep energy up beyond 1:30am.<br/><br/>Staring later than 9 will throw people off for lunch, so you get energy lag there too.  But starting at 8 dooms most games to failure as everyone stays up way too late most cons anyway.<br/><br/>A closing meal or ceremony would add a nice bookend to the perfect con.

Plan a short session or two in the morning, a long session in the afternoon, and an unlimited late-night one, perhaps. You can choose a rule that's easy to remember, like "Slot X is X hours long" or something similar, to keep people on the same page more or less transparently. You can also set up slots to be highly divisible by each others' lengths (1, 2, and 4 hours, say) and then have tables 1-2 do four one-hour slots, 3-4 do two two-hour ones, and 5-6 doing a four-hour game during each session, maybe blocking two or three of those in a day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328237/#Comment_328237" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T12:41:15+00:00" title="June  7, 2011 12:41PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why not indeed?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328248/#Comment_328248" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T13:08:46+00:00" title="June  7, 2011  1:08PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm pretty sure there's no one best way to do it, just a number of good ways that fit your particular con.<br/><br/>At Go Play NW, we do a mix of ad-hoc gaming and pre-scheduled. We have pre-defined slots, which means that a good portion of the con gathers in one spot before each slot. One of the effects of this is to encourage people to talk about what they want to play and find people they want to play with. The opportunity to gather is, I think, one of the most important things about Go Play NW.<br/><br/>We also have a half-hour afternoon break (which I think was new last year). This works really well. A lot of people choose to play into the break if they feel their session isn't properly done. It adds some flexibility.<br/><br/>We have a mix of slot sizes (2.5, 3, and 4 hour), which seems to work well. I see a lot of games of different lengths being played, and this accommodates that mix well. Also, last year and this year we've had people select a slot to run multiple short-short games, which makes me thing that even shorter slots might something for cons to consider.<br/><br/>Another important thing at Go Play NW is that we facilitate pre-scheduled games, but expect the GM/facilitator to handle the details of scheduling. This is in contrast to cons where events are registered with the con and then put into some kind of uber-schedule.<br/><br/>FRIDAY<br/>5:00 pm: Doors open<br/>5:00-6:00 pm: Hang Out Time<br/>6:00-7:30 pm: Friday Night Feast<br/>7:30-8:00 pm: Feast clean-up, game set-up<br/>8:00-Midnight: FRI-01 Gaming 4 hours<br/><br/>SATURDAY<br/>9:00-Noon: SAT-01 Gaming 3 hours<br/>Noon-1:00 pm: Lunch<br/>1:00-3:30 pm: SAT-02 Gaming 2.5 hours<br/>3:30-4:00 pm: Afternoon break<br/>4:00-6:30 pm: SAT-03 Gaming 2.5 hours<br/>6:30-8:00 pm: Dinner<br/>8:00-Midnight: SAT-04 Gaming 4 hours<br/><br/>SUNDAY<br/>8:30 am: Doors open<br/>9:00-Noon: SUN-01 Gaming 3 hours<br/>Noon-1:00 pm: Lunch<br/>1:00-4:00 pm: SUN-02 Gaming 3 hours<br/>4:00-4:30 pm: Afternoon break<br/>4:30-8:30 pm: SUN-03 Gaming 4 hours                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328254/#Comment_328254" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T13:34:29+00:00" title="June  7, 2011  1:34PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 7, 2011 1:36PM by Ross_Cowman.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like fixed slots, being on the same schedule gave FabReal this really great summer camp vibe.<br/> The pre-session roundups were one of the best things at FabReal.

This creates opportunities for groups to play through two short games, or players to jump between two short games, while also providing a convenient 'extra long' slot (since otherwise I think a 5 hour slot at a con is just excessive) that will gain extra time by playing through the break between the two shorter slots as well. It also allows players in the previous slot to play long if they want, knowing that they won't be stuck with a huge 3+ hour window as a result -- instead they can probably find a game in the second short slot. A similar opportunity exists for socialization or long lunches or even naps. <br/><br/>Basically, variety is best. When every slot in the con is 4 hours, and there is a single 1 hour lunch break, then doing anything that takes 90 minutes becomes a hugely inefficient idea. And lots of things that take 90 minutes are fun to do.<br/><br/>I think how early your con starts depends on how late it goes, pretty much straight up. If you have a slot that runs until 2am, don't start until 10 -- if you only go until midnight, then a 9am slot is more reasonable. Etc.<br/><br/>And the idea of a con where the slots are not all lined up just sounds so, so, SO terrible. That just doesn't even sound like a con to me, so much as a random assemblage of people in the same space, all following their own personal schedule that may or may not intersect with anyone else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328265/#Comment_328265" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T14:21:22+00:00" title="June  7, 2011  2:21PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: zircher</cite>I'm a fan of built-in breaks between game slots.</blockquote>\nOne con I was a guest at had as the schedule: 10-2, 2-6, 6-10. I was working two of those shifts and had an event in the third I didn't want miss. As a result, I felt like the day was going to be hell. I pointed this out to the con organizers, who said "last year, people said they didn't use the breaks anyway." Then I swore at said organizer (who's a friend, so it was in good spirit).<br/><br/>It was hell, but it was equally hellish on everyone. My 2pm game started late because people rushed out to get food. The 6pm game even later. There was no time to actually rest in between games. Made an otherwise fun con pretty annoying.<br/><br/>I love the setup for the LA Strategicons. The slots are by and large: 9-1, 2-6, 8-12. It used to be 10-2, 3-7, 8-12; but a combination of folks feeling like they wanted to eat before the first game was done and people wanting a longer dinner break caused the shift. There was some concern that it would cause the morning games to be more sparsely attended, and that ended up being true -- however, not in an appreciably bad way. The "hardcore" still got up to play. It works out for everyone.<br/><br/>- Ryan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328271/#Comment_328271" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T14:38:58+00:00" title="June  7, 2011  2:38PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All of us 9-5ers that should be no problem.  :-)<br/><br/>Funny thing about those that talk about a slot running short.

Socialization is granted by lunch and dinner, and it works better if at least one of these is managed and intentionally brings everyone in the same room. Usually slots last 3 to 4 hours.<br/>A chill-out con is something we are recently trying in Italy. It is built over 2 slots, of 6 to 8 hours. Dinners organization is left to each and every "table" (playing groups) and socialization is naturally left to the small breaks that everyone takes in these long lasting game slot.<br/><br/>We are going to have a big "chill-out" type this July, in a hotel in Montecatini, a city near Florence.

People would like the morning slot to be four hours as well, but not have it start earlier or finish later. I agree with them, but no-one's come up with a better timing. <br/><br/>The 9.00am-10.00am slot is appreciated as a time for socialising and crossing traders' palms with silver. If games finish early, there's generally people around to relax with and chat to, and a few casual board/card games to play. <br/><br/>I like the idea of having short slots (2 - 2.5 hours) that can be merged for longer games but, as Jenskot says, the demand seems to be for the longer sessions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
