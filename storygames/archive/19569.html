I take an epicurean approach to gaming recently I invited some of my improv buddies over to play <a href="http://lookrobot.co.uk/2014/02/12/one-last-job-rpg/" rel="nofollow"><i>One Last Job</i></a>.<br/><br/>This game is a great genre emulator. Just reading the rules I could see the awesome melodramatic heist movie stories unfolding in my head. There are so many parts of the game that are totally diceless. Nine times out of ten failing a roll is more fun and interesting than succeeding.<br/><br/>I think my favorite part of the game is how it starts. The GM sets the stage for the life of a master thief after (s)he has retired. One of the players who is inspired by the setup jumps in as the thief. The Player and GM then play out a scene of someone approaching that thief to come out of retirement. The play then remarks (s)he will need a specialist to help with the job and sets the sage for a new character to be recruited. So the character creation process is actually a sereis of active scenes. Skills and abilities are decided in a similar fashion. They are created in the moment by the party doing flashbacks to demonstrate a character's skill.<br/><br/>I recorded an actual play of our experience with <i>One Last Job</i> for my RPG comedy show. <a href="http://peachesandhotsauce.com/podcasts/51-one-last-job" rel="nofollow">Here is the link to the first part of the session.</a><br/><br/>Edit: Fixed link to actual play                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gshowitt" title="gshowitt"><img alt="gshowitt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gshowitt">gshowitt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435053/#Comment_435053" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-09T15:40:33+00:00" title="July  9, 2014  3:40PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [OLJ author here]<br/><br/>I'm super-excited to see where you guys go with this; the improv you're pulling off is hilarious, and I'm really happy to have built a system that can support it. It also makes me think that there's probably a hack for a diceless system, or at least one with far fewer rolls in yer average action scene, to speed up play and gear it towards a performative state.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435068/#Comment_435068" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-09T20:50:24+00:00" title="July  9, 2014  8:50PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James et al --<br/>I believe the best advertisement for a game is a good AP, and you've proven it again.  <br/>I'm laughing my frikkin' ass off, and I am buying this game!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ONE_SHOT" title="ONE_SHOT"><img alt="ONE_SHOT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ONE_SHOT">ONE_SHOT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435114/#Comment_435114" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-10T14:09:18+00:00" title="July 10, 2014  2:09PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/gshowitt">@gshowitt</a> I really think there is a potential for diceless play here. I do think that threatens what I really love about  the stamina system. I like the idea that people can die tragically or even betray the party. It would be possible (but difficult) to keep that in the game if you went diceless.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Aslf">@Aslf</a> Enjoy yourself!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
