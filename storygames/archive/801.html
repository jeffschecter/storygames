                    This is something I keep noticing and forgetting about, so I'm saying out loud in the hopes that writing down in public this incredibly banal observation will cement it in the forefront of my mind.<br/>
<br/>
Here goes.  In the olden days, games were designed either in ignorance of (or at least agnostic to) rules tweaking or in resistance to them.  In this fairy-tale history of RPGs, early games na√Øvely assumed that they merely needed to simulate their fictional reality and everything would be fine.  Later games were formulated in anticipation of such tweaks and strove to close every loophole -- and almost inevitably failed.<br/>
<br/>
One of the brilliant design precepts of indie games (and I while I think this was intentional, I don't know if it's been clearly formulated before...) is that you should expect players to apply the rules in such a way as to maximize their power in the game.  That this is right and natural, and if you go with that energy it's amazingly powerful.  <br/>
<br/>
So as to avoid using ??Dogs in the Vineyard?? as an example _again,_ let me point to ??The Shadow of Yesterday.??  Keys.  You make your character more powerful by characterizing him and then playing to those characterizations.  And when you're playing TSoY you almost get this weird feeling or impropriety, as if you were exploiting the system terribly.  And you are.  But the secret is, the system is there to be exploited, and when you're exploiting the hell out of it, you're spinning it right up, making it do what it's supposed to do.<br/>
<br/>
And that's awesome - and worth serious consideration in any design.                </div>

                            You're just saying in a positive way that Narrativism is the new Munchkinism, which I'm afraid isn't a very new idea. Though frankly, it is a positive thing, and an important realization. <br/>

                            I've been arguing for a while now that minmaxing and exploiting the system isn't a problem with the player, it's a problem with the system.  The player is merely doing what the system rewards (building an effective character or whatever the system rewards).  So minmaxing can only be detrimental to the game if the system is rewarding behavior that is detrimental to play.  At which point you need to ask: why is the system rewarding a disruptive playstyle?  If it rewarded a productive playstyle, then minmaxing should be encouraged.                        </div>

<p>I don't want to really tie the Munchkin/Narr thing together, because the basic meaning of Munchkin IS a bad thing, and it's silly to work against that meaning. And really, in most gameplay the Munchkin is disrupting everyone else's fun, and they're doing so despite knowing that what they do is disruptive.</p>
<p>But no disagreement to the core point. Most players, certainly including non-munckins, <em>do</em> want to be able to lean on a system to help them get what they want done. (This is why they'll spend their Drama Points in really important scenes, and so on.) So the better made systems let them work towards their goals without disrupting the group's goals.</p>

                            It isn't narrativism.  It's simply realizing that people like rewards, and giving them rewards for socially positive, rather than socially negative, activities.<br/>

<p>Then it's actually much more important to not tie rewards-powered mechanics with Munchkinism, because the former is a really important and powerful tool to making games that work, of really any stripe or agenda.</p>

                            Well, I did start out calling it an "incredibly banal observation."<br/>
<br/>
I have to agree with Dev and Ben, here: it's not munchkinism, but at first it does sort of feel that way.  I also don't think it's exclusively a narrativist tack, although I've yet to see strongly non-narr games go this way.<br/>
<br/>
As to this being a restatement of System Matters, I don't think that's necessarily so, although I see a relationship between the two ideas.  Of course the system matters; Ron has a strong, clear argument there -- the ideal GM can run anything, but he can run it better with a well adapted ruleset.  <br/>
<br/>
But there's nothing there about how to accomplish that adaptation.  Not that I'm saying that this is the One True Way, or even that it's my discovery.  I'd deny both statements vigorously.                        </div>

<p>Man, that dude doesn't know what he's talking about. He's discussing narrativism without rules to support it.</p>
<p>He's also equating Narrativism to "The heroes always win". Which is bizarre. Because that's not how I read Schismatrix, or Red Mars (in which the one guy who's arguably a hero dies on page 3 of a 2000 page book), or Powers, or BPRD, or Blade Runner. Shit, that's not even how I read Lord of the Rings. Characters all make hard choices and lose stuff because of it. Narrativist play is about actually getting to make those choices.</p>
<p>But more importantly, games have been separating player and character power in interesting ways.</p>
<p>Remi, one of your guys gut-shot himself, too? I did that in Dust Devils at GenCon last year! Awesome!</p>

                            Heh, we can dogpile the dude, but he was writing pretty tongue-in-cheek.<br/><br/>I definitely do see a disconnect, though, right here from his lack of what the "Whiff Factor" is and proscibed methods of fixing it. He basically thinks the Fix for the Whiff Factor is to never have your heroes fail.<br/><br/>That's not correct. It's basically "Make them fail and fail hard: But don't always make it because they fucking whiffed".  Those ideas, coded into Sorcerer and Sword, pretty much picked my ass up from whatever RPG world I was living in and set me down, gently, on "the other side of the fence". :-)<br/><br/>I still see its effects with my weekly gaming group, and we've been gaming for years:<br/><br/>Me as GM: "Roll to impress the barwench" (in CONAN OGL)<br/>Player: "Crap, I rolled a 2. Fuck, well I guess that means that I bite my tongue or stab myself or something".<br/>Me: "Er... no? I mean, if that's cool with you, that's fine by me.  I was just thinking that it turns out... hmmm... that the barmaid is actually pretty devoutly married. In fact, you notice that the young lad sweeping the back might be her child. And that she was passing pretty warm glances at the tavernkeep. She resists your advances".<br/>Player: "Oh, yeah that works for me!"<br/><br/>Fixing the whiff factor doesn't mean you never fail, it means you don't fail as fucking lame as the traditional Mountain Dew and Cheetos GM will have you.<br/><br/>Fail your sword skill? You drop your sword.<br/>Fail your horseriding check? You fall off your horse.<br/>Fail your healing check? Turns out that you can't take out an appendix as easily as you normally do. You cut them open wrong and they bleed to death.<br/><br/>Lame, lame, lame.<br/><br/>The whiff fix is basically using "the surroundings" to set up failure... or heck, even success!  <br/><br/>Maybe breaking out of whiffing could be turned into some kind of exercise or drill. One person says:<br/><br/>"I failed my running roll while escaping the bandits"<br/><br/>and the other person has to 'use the scenery':<br/><br/>"OK... you're pulling ahead, but it turns out that two of the bandits used to be messenger/runners for the empire. They're on you in no time, and it chills you that they didn't seem to break a sweat".<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>"I failed my surgery roll on that NPC when pulling out a bullet".<br/><br/>"Hmmm. Turns out that she was allergic to the anesthetic, although she showed no signs of allergy earlier.  Her heart starts racing out of control as she goes into allergic shock."<br/><br/>etc.<br/><br/>Ohhh, total tangent there...                        </div>

                            But a really neat tangent. :P I'm definitely going to have to try that next time I run a game. It also reminds me of... was it octaNe? Some game or other where it was a major part of the system that the dice couldn't make your character look like a chump. It hadn't occurred to me that one could apply that approach even to solidly traditional games.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like a dumb tautology to say that the rules of a game are meant to be used to play the game, but sometimes the blindingly obvious needs to be stated.<br/>
<br/>
I can only remember two really munchkinish players from back in high school, and they didn't actually even care about getting attention or disrupting the group. Rather, they just made the most powerful characters possible, with no reason or objective ever becoming clear. Which was how we wound up with two Mega-Juicers on our expedition into the Himalayas in Rifts. It was weird.                        </div>

                            Just once, I think it would be hilarious to have a game of Rifts where come second session, you cut ten years into the future! "Oh, all you guys who made juicers, you've expired. What, you didn't think that would come into play?"                        </div>

                            Naw, Andy, that's not the Whiff Factor, either. That's Czegian "Deprotagonization" (which can result from the Whiff Factor). The Whiff Factor, per se, and if I recall correctly, is simply that the system in question makes you roll many times to accomplish things, and that most of the rolls are failures. The classic example being the first level D&amp;D character who needs to roll an 15 to hit, and is making contact once every 4 rounds. What's cool about failing 75% of the time flailing to hit at orcs?<br/>
<br/>
Or, outside of combat in situations where the character has only one attempt, it's like the Rolemaster chart that tells us that the character only has a 25% chance to walk across a three foot wide board without falling off. Three feet wide!<br/>
<br/>
Basically it's about systems that, in order to give a range of ability to characters, make characters who are incompetent at everything other than that which they are experienced specialists. That's the Whiff Factor. <br/>
<br/>
See also Pay to Suck, meaning having to spend currency to get to a point where you're still really bad (or in odd cases, even worse than before). <br/>
