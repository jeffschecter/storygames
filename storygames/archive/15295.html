We'll have two game slots, one starting at 11 and another at 3. No signup sheet this time, just show up, maybe even with a game to pitch, and we'll match games and players live.<br/><br/>We have a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=193038220770787" rel="nofollow">Facebook event page</a> which is probably the easiest thing to share, if you feel like sharing. Sharing is nice, as my small children frequently point out.<br/><br/>Anyway, I figured we could use this thread for any discussion people might want leading up to the event, and then for writeups afterwards. Hope to see at least a few of you there!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347589/#Comment_347589" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-01T21:51:03+00:00" title="November  1, 2011  9:51PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will probably just run stuff this time.

Sorry about that.<br/><br/>That said, we had enough people for a full boat of John Harper's scenario game "Lady Blackbird". The Internet's own Ryan Macklin was kind enough to run it for us, and it was great. Everyone who hasn't played it yet - if you find yourself at a six-person table, play already. Totally worthwhile, with a great setup, plus it's pretty close to the high-water mark for mechanical elegance. (Plus it's free (get it <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/ladyblackbird/" rel="nofollow">here</a>) and beautiful!) Among the participants was one of my cow orkers who had never played a non-D&amp;D story game before, and he immediately loved No Myth. "There are goblins. Are there aliens? Because Naomi is like a pit-fighter from Mortal Kombat; she has four arms, covered in slave tattoos." That was a great reminder for me of why I started exploring systems. Snargle wound up with a lot of spotlight in our game - and a fun performance to match, by the way - in a way that makes me think that he might actually be John's favorite character.<br/><br/>In the afternoon, we decided to play Daniel Solis' <a href="http://danielsolisblog.blogspot.com/2007/08/do-pilgrims-of-flying-temple.html" rel="nofollow"><i>Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple</i></a>, following my favorite plan of playing two letters so the advancement rules can come into play. It turned out that no one but me had played anything but the demo letter (the Melanie-whale-cookies one), so everyone got something new. We started with Melanie's plight, then did John Wick's "i r goblin, elf killed all my friends, dwarf took all our stuff" letter, which I've been wanting to do since I read the book. As usual, Do was fun, and its unusual relationship between the players and the fiction added a bit of a brain stretch to the evening's entertainment.<br/><br/>We wound up with a game of "The Big Idea", a game I love so much that when it looked like Cheapass Games was never going to revisit it, I created my own revised edition. When Cheapass did eventually release a second edition, I was pleased to note that we had converged on several changes (most importantly, halving IPO payouts to make the stock trading more important), although I don't like the new foreign-capital rule, the divided deck, or the change away from (just) pairs of cards as the unit of play. Also, my words are better. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> At this point, it's likely I've played the game more often than its creators, and possibly more than anyone on the planet. Anyway, we played it, and it produced its usual stream of fast-paced, absurd humor. <br/><br/>One of the products on offer, by Ryan, was an "Eldritch Hat", which seemed like it would have been an OK name for a game publishing endeavor, don't you think?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
