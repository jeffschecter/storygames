She was born premature and has had a lot of health problems throughout her life. She was also born with a cleft lip and palate, and although they've been repaired, still has difficulty talking and has some communication issues. She's a bit delayed in a lot of her development, but has no cognitive problems.<br/><br/>I'm thinking I want to try to introduce her to RPGs. She sees me reading my books all the time (in point of fact, she's looking through my ZoZ book as I write this) and will soon see me playing frequently as a gamer friend is moving in with us and we're going to be having biweekly sessions here at our place. I think if she and I had a game together, she could get a little insight into what it is Daddy does with his friends.<br/><br/>I also think it might help her with her communication problems. She and I have made up a lot of stories together before, but I think having a bit of structure and it being a "game" she would be driven a bit more to try to be more clear in her speech.<br/><br/>And\u2026 I have to admit\u2026 the idea of playing an RPG with her really delights me. We don't do enough fun things together anyway, and if I can get her to be a geek with me for a little bit, I think it would pretty special for both of us. If she ends up digging it, it could obviously be a real bonding experience.<br/><br/>So here's my question: What are the basic skills she should have to be able to play?<br/><br/>Like I said, she's a little delayed developmentally. She only reads at a 1st grade level. She can do simple addition *really* well (has started doing it in her head) but subtraction throws her a little bit. She can do it, she just needs more time and some counting aids. She knows how to read pips on regular dice and, of course, can read numbered dice just fine. She can write, but is still in that stage where the words don't necessarily all go in the correct order, and needs a lot of help with words beyond her reading level and forming complete sentences.<br/><br/>She has one hell of an imagination. She role-plays by herself with her "animal friends" (stuffies) all the time. They have tea parties, go on adventures, fight, and have complete conversations at times.<br/><br/>So what's the level of reading and math necessary to play the game? I'm *hoping* it's light enough that she isn't intimidated by it, but I wouldn't mind if it also helped her learn a bit, too.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/somelady" title="somelady"><img alt="somelady" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/somelady">somelady</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186197/#Comment_186197" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T06:17:26+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  6:17AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "for kids" box on this subject <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> says the only math skills are adding and telling even number from odd ones.  I'd say the adding is well within simple.  I've also seen a variation pulling two different colored stones out of a bag rather than rolling for even/odd.  As for reading/writing, the only thing would be if she wanted a gift or something she couldn't remember all the details to really.  Assuming you explained the rules to her of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186206/#Comment_186206" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T06:57:08+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  6:57AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing that you might come across is a vocabulary limitation? Some of the Gifts have 'Lore', 'Hardy', 'Empathy' and 'Sidekick' which might not be natural parts of your daughters everyday speech - but thats only going to be a problem on the first pass, obviously!<br/>\n<br/>\nI played AFT with my kids when they were 6 and 9 and they adored it. It is a ridiculously simple mechanic that allows for a whole lot of fun.

And if you take a close look at the credits, you'll see that I contributed to the book as well.<br><br>Faeries Tale was designed with families in mind. The mechanics of it are dirty simple, and meant to be used with a high amount of interrpretation by the Storyteller (GM). It doesnt' sound like she will have trouble with the dice, but if she has, then you might use the black and white stone method. If she has trouble with the terms, then perhaps all you would need to do is change some ot the terms to something she is more familiar with.<br><br>If you are worried about character generation, perhaps you could have her tell you about her faery.. or even have her draw a picture of her to help you create that faery for her.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vertigo25" title="vertigo25"><img alt="vertigo25" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://vertigo25.com/junk/supesavatar-tiny.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vertigo25">vertigo25</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186427/#Comment_186427" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T19:43:37+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  7:43PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think we can do this. I've seen some more comments on it elsewhere, and talked to my best friend about it. He's seen it played with kids much smaller than my girl and says he thinks she'll have no problems with it. Maybe some handholding going on, which is fine by me, but I think she gets the general gist.<br/><br/>She and I did a brief little scenario that I made up to kind of explain the concept of an RPG or story game. I explained that she would make up who the main character in the story was, and I would tell her things that were going on, and she would make decisions as to what to do. We did it in kind of a "choose your own adventure" style. That's something I've found helps even with adults new to games. We just played for a couple turns just to see if she got the basic concept and she definitely did and is now *begging* me to buy the game. That's what I get for opening my big mouth <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I'm definitely going to buy the PDF soon. I should probably wait until I sell some junk on eBay, but I'm not sure I\u2026 or she\u2026 can wait that long to try out the game <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Thanks for everyone's feedback.

I'll have to manage anyway.<br/><br/>As others have told you, things are gonna work just fine. Your daughter seems to be well equipped to dig into Faery's Tale. When it comes to reading and hard words; see it as an opportunity and not an obstacle. Offer her to look over the boons and gifts between games and help her out when she gets stuck. And remember to foreshadow upcoming events in the bedtime stories (just don't make them too exciting or she won't be able to sleep)!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
