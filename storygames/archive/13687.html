As someone who was planning on participating, that kind of put a crimp in my plans. Daniel Solis and I started discussing what made DM work in past years, and what would be required for some interested parties to resurrect it this year.<br/><br/>So, open question: assuming the same share-based model from past years, but new organizers, would you be interested in participating in the Design Matters booth this year?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309713/#Comment_309713" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-26T09:44:19+00:00" title="January 26, 2011  9:44AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Design Matters is a solid brand - I'm not usually inclined to participate in anything at all, but in this case I wouldn't hesitate, considering how Ron probably wouldn't have me at the Forge booth. However, I'm not going to Gencon this year due to not likely having any new English-language product for it, and selling old stuff won't cover enough of the expense (and bother) of flying from Europe. Sort of a shame, as my design work is philosophically rather along the same lines as the DM guys, it'd have been fun to do that booth as well. Perhaps next year.<br/><br/>Having observed DM for the last couple of years I recommend it to reasonably experienced mid-tier indies with hipster inclinations. As far as I can see, it works well for the people who built it, in other words. I wouldn't recommend participation to first-timers at Gencon unless as a mere flavouring for a core of more experienced folks.<br/><br/>Is it the entire lineup of DM past that's not coming, or is it just that they didn't get a sufficient quorum out of the core people? Would some of them be coming after all if they can just find 2-3 compatible new participants, or is this just about reusing the brand name with an entirely new crew?<br/><br/>Thinking of solutions, it occurs to me that the practical outcome of the DM efforts resembles the Pirate Jenny booth (in terms of style and the relevant demographics of the participating designers), so perhaps there'd be some potential for cooperation there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309720/#Comment_309720" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-26T10:04:59+00:00" title="January 26, 2011 10:04AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Design Matters is taking a year off for a combination of factors. The main thing is that Kevin and I won't be able to handle the logistics this year (I'm in my final semester of my graduate program, he's busy with real-life things as well). In a poll of our boothees, there wasn't anyone able to commit to handling said logistics in our place, and it sounds like a number of folks either won't be having new games or won't be attending this year anyway.<br/><br/>So, individual folks will be there, but on their own terms, as it were. And there's nothing keeping people who have been in Design Matters from going to or starting their own booth, if they're so inclined.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309723/#Comment_309723" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-26T10:12:38+00:00" title="January 26, 2011 10:12AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aw.
