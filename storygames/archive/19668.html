In other words, you;re stiull trying to twist these definitions to suit your prejudices, still trying to concoct some justification for slanderously offensive.<br/><br/>In your post in the other thread, you repeatedly referred to what YOU want when you play.  That's all well and good, but frankly, this isn't about you.  I'm not asking, let alone forcing, you to play in this manner.

If the label misrepresents what you do, then obviously enough she's not thinking or claiming that you do illusionism, and therefore she's very well not slandering <i>you</i>, right? Or did she nail you as the poster boy for illusionism somewhere else? Are you the railroading D&amp;D GM she played with? I'm clearly confused here.<br/><br/>As is likely obvious, I don't really care what a given term "means"; I'm often interested in how people use language, but I don't really have any stakes in it, you know. In this case Sandra's understanding/definition of what the word "illusionism" indicates seems to accord with the conventional history of the term: that's pretty much what the word used to be used for at the Forge, for instance. Seems weird to lambast her for using what amounts to the standard definition of the word, minor quibbling aside.<br/><br/>Also, if you have an alternate definition for the term that you'd like to use, Gareth, would you share?

I've fused RPG design with other forms of media.  I say this only to support that I think I'm in a fairly good position to view both of your points.  Our hobby (as Rickard likes to call it) is very broad, more flexible than we tend to think it is, and I actually want to broaden it even further!  So I understand the argument between you guys, and I don't think your differences will ever be resolved to your satisfaction.  Nor should they need to be.  <br/><br/>From my standpoint, the differences between you are orthogonal to what I'm doing.  Or perhaps better put: the differences between you illustrate the range of the problem domain, which will need to be spanned by the model.  A Hegelian Synthesis, if you will.<br/><br/>I don't oppose 2097/Sandra's position at all.  I'm sometimes ruffled by the strident way in which she communicates it, but she's not the only one.  I don't know why people get polemic about their favorite playstyles.  But I'm not talking about playstyles.  I still think it's possible for us to find common ground, to gain altitude by abstraction.  Sure, we will have issues over semantics and we'll figure those out, but as long as we can avoid arguing about what happens at our personal tables, I don't see any reason why we shouldn't all be able to proceed in a scientific fashion.<br/><br/>I appreciate the OP and what Sandra is trying to do here.  <br/>Perhaps we'll end up with two lines of research running on parallel rails!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436854/#Comment_436854" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T13:34:26+00:00" title="August 10, 2014  1:34PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2014 4:00PM by 2097.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How the fuck is me starting a new thread to get away from you and your infuriating posts me \u201ctelling you how you play\u201d? I started this in order to talk to those who are NOT you, contracycle.<br/><br/>You are welcome in the thread but please don\u2019t believe it\u2019s about you and your table.<br/><br/>Why the hell can\u2019t you respect that I want to be left alone by you and your fucking insults and words of \u201cnuts\u201d and \u201cinsanity\u201d and paranoid projections that I was even talking to you?<br/><br/>I chose the link that I did because it itself links to three useful threads for illusionism (and ditto four for participationism).<br/>The link for participationism says \u201cThis is distinct from Illusionism, however, in that the players are aware and active partners in this process.\u201d<br/><br/>When I have used the word illusionism I have meant it as \u201cUsing deception about the way the game world is constructed, or more egregiously, about the way game mechanics are used.\u201d and I gave examples.<br/>If players aren\u2019t deceived on either of these two points I have not called it illusionism.<br/>When it comes to semantics one thing and only one thing is important. The concept the speaker had in mind when she constructed the sentence. You can argue till the cows come home about what you believe the eleven-letter string \u201cillusionism\u201d rightfully means and should mean but that doesn\u2019t give you a time machine that can change what I meant when I spoke. I genuinely believed (as I do believe) that the word has common usage with the definition I outlined here and I gave links that I genuinely believe support that case. I didn\u2019t have a secret plan to use the word contrary to what I thought was (and think is) common usage in order to snare someone in a semantics trap.<br/><br/>Because I have (to my great shame) a semantics degree, I\u2019ve realized how empty semantics are and I\u2019ve given a life oath to not argue semantics and definitions beyond just stating \u201cWords apparently mean a lot of things to different people\u201d and being honest and careful and consistent and willing to change when it comes to definitions. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve taken such care to create this thread and clarify things like \u201cWhat I mean by \u2018rails\u2019\u201d, \u201cwhat I believe AsIf to mean by \u2018rails\u2019\u201d and so on.<br/><br/>IDGAF about your table and the way you play. \u201cSight unseen\u201d, fuck yes, sight unseen, thought unthunk and word unmentioned because I haven\u2019t been thinking about you, talking about you or mentioning you.<br/><br/>I\u2019ve been talking about a GMing style that I have seen to death and I don\u2019t care one bit about how much of it applies to you and how much doesn\u2019t.<br/><br/>It should be pretty fucking obvious that if what I am saying doesn\u2019t apply to you <em>then it fucking doesn\u2019t apply to you</em>. I didn\u2019t have you in mind when I started this thread and I sure as hellfire didn\u2019t have you in mind when I wrote:\n<blockquote>Using illusionism and other force techniques is a way to get around the expectations set by the game system itself and take away player agency.</blockquote>\nIf you don\u2019t try to get around expectations, then I\u2019m not fucking talking about you.<br/>If you don\u2019t take away player agency, then I\u2019m not fucking talking about you.<br/>If you don\u2019t use illusionism or force techniques for that purpose or with that as a side-effect, then I\u2019m not fucking talking about you.<br/>If you use such techniques with the consent of the players then you are by definition not using illusionism as defined here (which is <em>how I used it</em> when I wrote the quoted statement) so I\u2019m, in that case, not fucking talking about you.<br/><br/><br/>But if you are using the techniques for that purpose or with that as a side-effect, then <em>and only then</em> fucking listen \u2014 because in that case (and only in that case) apparently the concept isn\u2019t so \u201cabsurd, completely crazy, utterly, implausibly, nuts\u201d and my experience isn\u2019t so \u201cridiculous it shouldn't even be up for discussion\u201d. And if you are then <em>and only then</em> you are one of hundreds of player-agency\u2013depriving GMs I\u2019ve met online and one of several I have met \u2014 and been \u2014 over the table.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I don\u2019t see anything that is slanderously offensive in my OP in this \u201cRails, rails and definitions\u201d thread. I just don\u2019t. That\u2019s also why I started a new thread. <em>To be constructive.</em> Guess that went out of the window in less than three hours.<br/><br/>I genuinely thought the post would be helpful and it was also an apology/clarification to AsIf and Rickard for how I sloppily used the word \u201crails\u201d (in the way I\u2019ve always used it) in the D&amp;D AP thread.<br/><br/>And also to clarify to AsIf my participation/non-participation and interest/non-interest in the other couple of railroading threads that have been popping up recently.<br/><br/>AsIf, the fact that you are giving contracycle\u2019s post in this thread even the slightest light of day is debasing yourself so much. I\u2019d want a hegelian synthesis with his post about as much as I\u2019d want a sharp stick in the eye. Probably less.<br/>It\u2019s not about playstyle vs playstyle.

Perhaps the only difference in my experience is that in Illusionism, "scene exits" are dynamically handled by the GM. Usually, the GM's prep is about mostly starting points, obstacles, scene meta-goals and as much "scene exits" as he can come up with, All of that works better with a good dose of flexibility and good control of the focus of the group on key moments of the play.<br/><br/>So, a good illusionist GM can have many "scene exits" from one scene to another so players can freely jump from one into another and even create their own, yet they will end up in the prescribed situation after that. While a poor excuse of a railroading GM will put railings between his scene exit and any other created by the players, thus breaking immersion and initiating another kind of fun, a destructive one called "let's destroy the GM's railings and change the destination" which is the one I mentioned on the APs that initiated all this Railroading discussion lately.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436885/#Comment_436885" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T15:13:22+00:00" title="August 10, 2014  3:13PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2014 3:15PM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The second meaning of the word "rails" (i.e. "railings") also comes up if you ever take a child bowling.  They can raise the "rails" (railings) on either side of the lane, preventing the ball from falling into the gutter.  One can see how the word became polysemic (noyce word, that!): in both senses, forward motion is governed by the rail(s).  The difference is in how much play the ball has while traveling its course.  Meaning 1 directs the ball's course absolutely, while Meaning 2 provides a "heuristic" system with impenetrable boundaries.  This might be a metaphor worth mining.<br/><br/>The kids' bowling example suggests another notion: We may tend to think of these boundaries as being a defensive line for the GM's purposes ("plot" the typical jewel being protected).  But some boundaries might be placed to prevent the PCs from getting into trouble they're not ready to handle yet.  "Don't confront the Boss before you get the sword" kinda thing.  Not because of pacing or plot <i>really,</i> but simply because the GM knows that if they face that guy now, they're dead.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436887/#Comment_436887" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T15:35:40+00:00" title="August 10, 2014  3:35PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sandra,<br/><br/>Your post was very clear and made total sense to me.

And yet she persists in using the term to mean something that it does not mean, and to be insulting about it.  There is clearly more going on here than just terminological confusion.<br/><br/>Her understanding is absolutely NOT in accord with the conventional history of the term, nor is the difference a "minor quibble".  The issue of consent is not a trivial one, and falsely claiming that Illusionism occurs without consent is a pretty direct claim that anyone playing in that style is being abusive toward the players.  Why should, how could I, not take exception to that kind of accusation?<br/><br/>As above, I have provided the correct usage multiple times before, but to recap for you, Railroading = GM force without consent, Illusionism = GM force with consent, but behind a "black curtain", Participationism = GM force with consent and without a curtain.

Which happens to make me a rather more direct source than Kim's rather elliptical description.<br/><br/>And I can tell you that what that statement referes to is the presencer of the "black curtain", that is to say, that the GM;s intervention is either open, or concealed behind a "black curtain"; and the key point here is that in Illusionism play the players DO NO WANT to look behind that curtain, any more than they would in other forms of media.<br/><br/>It is NOT saying that that Illusionism lacks consent, quite the opposite.  You keep telling me "how you are using the term", even though I have repeatedly pointed out to you that your usage is incorrect, and provided citations from the very same threads that Kim linked for his definition showing you that this is is the case.\n<blockquote>If players aren\u2019t deceived on either of these two points I have not called it illusionism.</blockquote>\nWhich is the wrong point to consider.  The correct point is whether players enter into play with consent.  The issue of "deception" is more complicated, because it has at least two meanings here.  As I pointed out not so long ago, none of us watch someone getting shot on TV and really believe that they have been shot; we have at some level agreed to be be deceived by this depiction.<br/><br/>Deciding players about the actual operant social contract would be abusive, but then of course it cerases to be illusionism, because consent is absent.  It seems simple enouigh to me.\n<blockquote><br/>If you don\u2019t try to get around expectations, then I\u2019m not fucking talking about you.<br/>If you don\u2019t take away player agency, then I\u2019m not fucking talking about you.<br/>If you don\u2019t use illusionism or force techniques for that purpose or with that as a side-effect, then I\u2019m not fucking talking about you.<br/>If you use such techniques with the consent of the players then you are by definition not using illusionism as defined here (which is <em>how I used it</em> when I wrote the quoted statement) so I\u2019m, in that case, not fucking talking about you.</blockquote>\nSo, basically, you're not talking about me, except when you're talking about me.  Because you keep doing, you're doing it right here - directly equating Illusionism with taking away player agency.  It's not enough to say you "don't mean it that way" because you clearly do.  And where exactly is it "defined here"?  I don't see any SG glossary.  Even the sources that you're linking to provide the opposite definition.  This makes no sense to me at all.\n<blockquote>It\u2019s not about playstyle vs playstyle.

While Illusionism with consent is possible (that's what games that encourage GM fudging advocate, insofar as the players are expected to read and believe those parts of the rulebook), I don't see how consent would be mandatory. Certainly discussion has generally not presumed consent in Illusionist cases, actual play cases have usually not reported consent, and my own experiences are also consent-less: when I've GMed or played in Illusionistic games, it has been without player knowledge of the specific extent of the GM's powers, and thus without them being able to grant consent.<br/><br/>The term "railroading", on the other hand, has never been much used for accurate theory work that I know. If I were to give the term a precise definition, I certainly wouldn't say that it is force without consent, but rather that it's goal-oriented use of GM powers (force or otherwise), which is often considered non-consensual due to that type of usage being illegitimate (even if available) in the games where this becomes a problem. That seems to fit the archetypal use cases much better than the idea that railroading is necessarily non-consensual, and any use of force might apply. (As a clarifying example, I would be surprised if a GM who killed a PC because they didn't like the player was characterized as "railroading" in a natural dialogue; the term is usually reserved for situations where the GM is manipulating play to achieve their desired plot, after all, putting the PCs "on rails" in a metaphorical manner instead of letting them choose their own direction. Dragonlance is railroading, but surely not any and all force use is.)<br/><br/>Maybe you and Sandra have some history that makes this seem like she's targeting you, Gareth, but if that's the case, she's sure doing a mighty skilled job about making it seem otherwise. Perhaps I should've read your dialogues in the past few threads more carefully to figure out whether you're being unjustifiably testy about this.<br/><br/>Regardless of the terminological minutiae, though, Sandra denied the notion that she's attempting to slander you. Presumably that's the end of that strand of discourse: either it was an innocent misunderstanding, or Gareth needs to get moderation assistance to deal with the bullying, because we don't really have any social moves left if Gareth doesn't believe Sandra about her intentions. Believing what others say is the bare minimum of communication, after all, and nobody is served by you two fighting. Either make up or get the adults to take one of you home <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Barring that, I missed it when Gareth was made Mr. Illusionism, so that any use of the term, false or correct by some historical usage accounts, directly impinge upon his honor. Assuming this has been a terminological misunderstanding, surely we can just agree to not use that specific word if it's too emotionally loaded for us here and now. For example, we could talk directly about the specific GM powers, the curtain, consent and player knowledge of the system in play, thus avoiding the use of both "Illusionism" and "Participationism" altogether.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_436901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436901/#Comment_436901" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T19:15:44+00:00" title="August 10, 2014  7:15PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>"I think that a shared agreement "to be deceived" is typically involved, i.e., what I described before as the players not wanting to look behind the black curtain, and everyone being happy that the curtain is there. When that happens,<b> Illusionism is functional, primarily because no element of the Social Contract is being threatened or violated.<br/><br/><b>When, however, the social contract...is broken.. regarding this issue, then we're into railroading.</b></b></blockquote>\nThis is a discussion dating to 2002.  So the tripartite usage I described has been in place for more than a decade.  I'm not "Mr Illusionism", I'm "Mr Don't Piss On My Cornflakes".<br/><br/>So whatever.  If he collective "you" wants to ignore the established terminology, fine, I can't stop you.  I would ask, though, that you propose some new way for us to distinguish between play which features consensual and non-consensual GM force.  Because without that distinction, we see precisely what happens in 2097's posts, that any usage of GM force is automatically deemed a violation of social contract and inherently abusive.<br/><br/>What I can't condone is writing off a whole swathe of functional games, with a an openly agreed and willingly entered social contract, as BadWrongUnfun.  It does not seem to me that if someone here were volubly denouncing Narratavism as a bad and abusive playstyle that this claim would be met with the equanimity you aparently expect me to exhibit.  And the whole farrago smacks of the early days of RPG culture on the internet, which was full of mutual denunciation and vindictive rhetoric about who was or was not "playing right".  I had thought the days of One True Wayism were well behind us.<br/><br/>If, and it's a big "if", we can truly have a discussion abut consensual and constructive used of GM force, without all the moralistic grandstanding that has infested every prior attempt, I'll be on board with that.  It seems a bit of a pity that we have to fire up the Delorean and cover ground that was well trodden at the beginning of this century, but so be it.  The minimum point of entry for that discussion, however, is that advocates of GM force not be targetted by personal attacks on their ethics and honesty.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436905/#Comment_436905" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T19:57:10+00:00" title="August 10, 2014  7:57PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know, I've sort of gotten used to narrativism-bashing. Plenty of folks out there who hate that sort of thing. I mostly save myself the grief these days, life's too short and so on and so forth.<br/><br/>As for learning from history, we have to realize that new people are constantly coming not only to the Internet, but also into our own social circles. Sandra here, for example - as far as I know, I haven't noticed her in the parts of the Internet I frequent before this summer. It is the nature of the public forum institution that we can't just declare this or that obvious truth settled and then start quoting scripture for any newcomers until they get up to speed.<br/><br/>Or rather, we could, but then we should also close off admittance, practically speaking. You can't just decide that new acquaintances would need to read the minutes of the last 15 or 20 years of hobby blather before they're allowed to say their piece, that's just not going to work. Either we hunker down with our own cadre of peers from back when to ensure that we never need to retread old ground, or we accept the cyclical nature of public communication. And that means getting used to evolving terminology, teaching and learning continuously.<br/><br/>Regarding discussing Illusionism constructively, I think it's well possible - you know that we've gone over this stuff before, you I and many others; I at least do not find it difficult at all to assume a consensual and artistically worthwhile Illusionist game. Insofar as we haven't gotten very far on the topic yet, well, ultimately it's due to the fact that the Illusionism discussions tend to be framed with unwanted Illusionism as a problem, with the few advocates in a reactive position; essentially we only end up talking about Illusionism when Jason and you and whoever come in to complain about all the bad shit others say about Illusionism when they relate their (often negative) experiences. It is understandable that that's not the most conducive environment for a discussion about the positive possibilities of Illusionism, when so often the discussion topic is something along the lines of "how do I get my GM to stop illusioneering" or "have others also wanted to break away from illusionism practices".<br/><br/>Of course it is also easy for me to admit to a personal bias: not being a fan of the games that are most often used as base chassis for Illusionistic gaming, and not being an ardent practitioner myself, it's easy for me to have nothing to say even if an occasional constructive discussion was attempted. For all I know somebody'll come in soon and tell me that we've actually had like three threads this summer right here, and I simply didn't notice because it's not a supreme interest for me. That's a factor to acknowledge, too: a positive discussion of Illusionism can be difficult because nobody necessarily has a high motivation for having that discussion.<br/><br/>I'll leave off on the topic of terminological pedantry, evaluation of authoritative sources and the differences between necessary and possible modalities, on the principle that insofar as this is just a terminological dispute, then it doesn't really matter who's right or wrong about what Illusionism "originally" means. What matters here and now is that core issue of moral condemnation; I'm sure Sandra will correct me if I'm wrong, but I understood from her explanation that she did not intend to condemn consensual Illusionism as morally reprehensible, and therefore there is actually no contention between the two of you. It is important to understand that despite the emotional charge on both sides, no actual harm has been intended or caused, no matter what the monkey brain might try to tell us.

I might have a few odd thoughts, and perhaps there are others here who might contribute. I imagine that a big part in how negative the general impression towards Illusionism is here is played by the fact that there aren't really well-known overtly Illusionist games out there (I'm discounting the traditional lineage here, mostly because the majority of the people on this forum have not apparently experienced these games as Illusionistic by intent), so nobody really has any positive narrative patterns to lean on when thinking about the phenomenon in a favourable light.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Khimus" title="Khimus"><img alt="Khimus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Khimus">Khimus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436908/#Comment_436908" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T20:29:37+00:00" title="August 10, 2014  8:29PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2014 8:35PM by Khimus.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I too understood Illusionism as a gaming style absent of players consent, and pretty much never ever found anyone claiming the opposite.

Sometimes they accept it because finding a group or another GM is hard, sometimes because the GM is their friend, or because they just like to play that way. But I don't think it's awesome to keep a very important component of the social contract a secret: every group would benefit from talking openly about what they're going to play, and how they're going to play it. The only case where I think it is not necessary is for groups with a lot of history, like 10 years of playing together. And still, it is usually an issue when those groups accept somebody new, and because nobody will tell him the truth about how they <i>really </i>play, he might take many sessions to discover it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436929/#Comment_436929" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-11T00:59:23+00:00" title="August 11, 2014 12:59AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2014 11:17PM by 2097.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pt 1/2.\n<blockquote>Because we've gone far beyond an innocent mistake here.

Nor is the difference between what I have believed the word to mean and what you \u2014 which is apparent in this post, but which I wasn\u2019t aware of before \u2014 a minor quibble.\n<blockquote>As above, I have provided the correct usage multiple times before, but to recap for you, Railroading = GM force without consent, Illusionism = GM force with consent, but behind a "black curtain", Participationism = GM force with consent and without a curtain.

OK, the players believe that they are playing a game that works this way. But in reality you should author a story for them. They believe that rule X works like this but in secret, just do Y instead.\u201d<br/><br/>And I\u2019m not going around to people\u2019s tables and snatching the games away. I\u2019m just saying that they were bad and wrong to be my \u201cfirst games\u201d because I couldn\u2019t make heads or tails of them since I didn\u2019t have the \u201cbase to stand on\u201d that previous generations had by playing D&amp;D and Traveller.<br/>\n<blockquote>The minimum point of entry for that discussion, however, is that advocates of GM force not be targetted by personal attacks on their ethics and honesty.</blockquote>\nThe only one that has been making fucking personal attacks is you and the only one who as specifically called out someone as unethical and dishonest is you.<br/><br/>Let\u2019s talk about the black curtain here.<br/>There are a few reasons why a GM might hide information.<br/><br/>Let\u2019s say they have a prepared map of a dungeon and its contents. Part of the mode of play is exploration. Exploration is enhanced by the players not knowing the map of the dungeon and where the items are, which items are there. It\u2019s also enhanced by not giving the stats for the monsters they meet. Let\u2019s call this mode \u201cMode X\u201d. \u201cMode X\u201d means that the location and its contents are defined ahead of time but kept secret to the players.<br/><br/>Most players enter a dungeon crawl knowing that parts of this information will initially be secret.<br/><br/>Now, \u201cthe black curtain\u201d and \u201cillusionism\u201d has sometimes been defined as GMs disguising things as if they were prepared according to one mode, for example as \u201cMode X\u201d, but in reality there are other factors leading to how those things operate.<br/>Examples include:<br/>\u2022 \u201cI really want the party to meet this nice ogre so the ogre will be to the left if they go left, but right if they go right. This dorky snail will be in the other direction if they later decide to go down there too.\u201d<br/>\u2022 \u201cMan, the PCs are so powerful, I want them to feel challenged so I\u2019m just going to let the players [OOC] believe that monster HP matter but instead end the fight when I, the GM, feel it\u2019s dramatically appropriate to give them a hero moment.\u201d<br/>\u2022 \u201cOuch, I, the GM, rolled another crit and the player will die. Unless... yes! I can say that the monster missed!\u201d<br/>\u2022 And many others.<br/><br/>Examples don\u2019t include when the prep calls for filling in details like if it says \u201cRubbish heap with nothing of value\u201d, and the players look closely at each piece and the GM has to make things up on the spot like \u201cOK, a melon rind, an orange peel, some dirty leather patches, some leaves...\u201d<br/>The reason I exclude that example, is that I am particularly speaking of the situation where the GM is disguising which mode of play is active.<br/><br/>Now, there can absolutely be a \u201cCopperfield situation\u201d where the players are onboard with the GM using a mixture of these techniques and another mode, for example \u201cMode X\u201d, and they do not want to know the proportions of that mix. I have met at least one player who strongly felt this way, and, as Eero pointed out, this is common in northern Europe. I don\u2019t feel this way and I do not like to participate in this mode of play. But that\u2019s just me.<br/><br/>But there is also another pertinent reason why players don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on and that\u2019s because \u201cMode X\u201d inherently has secrets. Players may be onboard with respecting the secrets of \u201cMode X\u201d but not onboard with the secrets of the black curtain and the social contract is very hard to navigate here.<br/><br/>The GM might honestly believe \u2014 because of the vagaries of social contract \u2014 that the players are in a \u201cCopperfield situation\u201d, while in reality they might up and leave if they found out that they were not playing in \u201cMode X\u201d. This is probably the most common.<br/><br/>If the whole group is genuinely in a \u201cCopperfield situation\u201d then <em>I don\u2019t see the problem</em>.<br/><br/>But I <em>have</em> met GMs online who are in a \u201cThree Card Monte situation\u201d. They know that the expectation of \u201cMode X\u201d is what brings the players to the table, and they know that the game would forever be ruined if it was revealed that black curtain techniques were in action, but they do it anyway because they believe that the illusion of \u201cMode X\u201d that they can present through the curtain is better (more heroic, more dramatic, more better) than the real thing.<br/><br/>So, four situations:<br/>A. Genuine \u201cCopperfield situation\u201d<br/>B. GMs mistakenly believe it\u2019s \u201cCopperfield situation\u201d through misunderstandings about the social contract and CA<br/>C. \u201cThree Card Monte situation\u201d.<br/>X. Genuine \u201cMode X\u201d without black curtain techniques.<br/><br/>With all respect and honesty, I have encountered all four situations and it should be obvious that my ire is intended towards B and C.<br/>I also don\u2019t intend to accuse someone who is in one of the four modes to be in another of the four modes.<br/><br/>Now, a wrench in the gear for me personally is that I am very interested in the \u201cMode X\u201d CA and mode of play. The existance of modes A, B and C, however, has made \u201cMode X\u201d problematic. I\u2019ve taken to throwing away my GM screen, showing pages from the module, being open about stat blocks, writing things out in long hand (instead of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenomelin" rel="nofollow">short hand</a>) so I can show my prep to the players, among other things. This is obviously a chore.<br/><br/>\u201cMode X\u201d techniques that were genuinely useful have been compromised since they can easily be used for black curtain techniques.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436932/#Comment_436932" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-11T01:23:50+00:00" title="August 11, 2014  1:23AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2014 1:24AM by 2097.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The productive <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19132/magicians-choice-when-is-it-good-when-is-it-bad/" rel="nofollow">magician's choice thread from half a year back</a> is a good example of what I mean</blockquote>\nI\u2019ll just add that I don\u2019t remember reading that thread and even though I\u2019ve been registered at story-games for years, I only occasionally gorge on reading and writing here because I have found that it, as all forums for me, are prone to making me procrastinate and mismanage my home life.<br/>Nor <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/428006" rel="nofollow">the Shaintar thread</a>, in which I see Adam Dray define Illusionism and Participationism in a way that I interpret as consistent with the way I did.<br/>To me, that is a partial vindication that my usage was not deliberately malicious but part of a wider understanding of the term \u2014 or wider misunderstanding of the term.<br/><br/>I also see James writing in that thread:\n<blockquote>It's our old friends (or enemies), Participationism and Illusionism.
