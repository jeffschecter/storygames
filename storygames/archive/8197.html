They should be elements in motion in and of themselves, not just stuff sitting there going "look how genre appropriate I am!"<br/><br/>I mean, you could take any <i>one</i> of the elements from the original oracles, and tell a story about that. I just drew one from god-kings of war at random, and happened to get my favorite: "A cask of honey wine, tribute to a fierce bandit-queen." Look at that. You've got the fierce bandit-queen. You've got her loyal bandits. And maybe some less-than-loyal bandits who wouldn't mind being in charge themselves. You've got the people forced to pay tribute (simple vintners and apiarists, obviously). You've got the sorry schlubs who have to actually take the cask, and bring it to the bandit-queen. You've got people who might try to steal and intercept it, for any number of reasons. And maybe someone is using the tribute as a ruse to try and get close to the bandit-queen so they can assassinate her? There's actually a whole wealth of stories that could revolve around that one simple cask of sweet, sweet honey-wine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180386/#Comment_180386" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T21:13:40+00:00" title="November 25, 2008  9:13PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some good suggestions here, I also want to say that there's a line beyond which you've said too much.

Objects of desire.</blockquote>\nYes. <i>This.</i><br/><br/>I've had a terrible time getting good oracle content from Abulafia. It's hit and miss; some are good, and some are bad (at least for one value of "bad"). The difference lies, not in any particular artistry or creativity about the entries as such, but in these explicit qualities that Joshua outlines.<br/><br/>Let's take two Oracles as examples. Both are a blind 'pull" from the Abulafia generator, though one of them had to be re-drawn because of duplicate entries (a recurring problem, fine folks of Abu!)<br/><br/>From the <b>Shakespeare Oracle:</b><br/><br/>A tribunal of senators, hearing a charge of witchcraft<br/>A picture, meant to signify devotion<br/>The funeral of a beloved daughter, struck dead with grief<br/>A clown and miscreant, seeing the lewd in all things<br/><br/><br/>See how pregnant with conflict these are? I got particularly lucky in that these entries cross-pollinate nicely (a daughter dead of grief? Perhaps after being charged with witchcraft? And someone devoted to her, perhaps secretly?), bue even aside from this, there's things people might want, and a tense situation where they might boil over, and factors which might further agitate. Cool. We could easily have a juicy and tense IaWA game out of this. Or write a cool short story, or whatever.<br/><br/>Now, from the <b>Modern Occult Oracle:</b><br/><br/>Four of Clubs: A voodoo priestess is creating zombies from dead bodies left un-recovered from a terrible natural disaster.<br/>Four of Diamonds: Neighborhood cats all start taking their mutilated catches to the lawn of a single property, then the cats start disappearing.<br/>Two of Hearts: Every child that you encounter stares fixedly at you with obvious terror.<br/>Six of Spades: At Noon the sun is eclipsed...but not by the moon.<br/><br/>OK, these all look really spooky and evocative. . .except there's nothing much <i>happening</i> in them. They're just a bunch of atmosphere that a GM might say directly to a player ("Every child that <i>you</i> encounter. . ."), but there's no context, no drive, no people wanting shit and doin' something about it.Even the one example with a "character" is light on motivation and desire. Now, <i>combined</i> with other, more potent entries, that could be a fine element. see again the "cross-pollination" concept. A single item can be vague and mysterious (creating zombies? Why?) as long as there are other factors for it to careen into and suggest answers.<br/><br/>Without these qualities an "Oracle" is just a random Color generator.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-joel<br/><br/>PS. No offense to the creator of this or any other creator of the Abulafia fan Oracles. Most of the entries I'm talking about are indeed creative and evocative. They just don't give me what I need <i>as</i> an IaWA Oracle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180559/#Comment_180559" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-27T00:58:56+00:00" title="November 27, 2008 12:58AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 27, 2008 1:01AM by Brand_Robins.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I very much like Joshua's post. When I do Oracle entries, I always do something similar to that. I try to make sure that the entries are about things that are happening right now, people that have needs around those things, and that suggest characters both explicit and implicit. <br/><br/>That said, I think there is something of an art to making oracles that isn't easily summed, because not every kind of oracle will work for every player. <br/><br/>Look at tarot cards, for example. There are about a billion different decks of tarot cards available, and cards that aren't quite tarot cards but that are also used for divination. One of the reasons for this is different decks hit different folks in different ways. I cannot stand the Rider Waite tarot, for example. It does nothing for me, nothing at all, despite being the "standard." OTOH, give me the Shakespeare Dream Cards set, and I can get all divinatory all day long. <br/><br/>Similarly, there is a sweet spot for me with some oracles that I know isn't sweet for other folks I play with. I hate any oracle that tells me rather than suggests to me. I want them to be oracles, damnit, to provoke me to create my own characters and issues and places -- not to foist them off on me. I don't want bits of story so much as I want tags that lead me into bits of story. (And in this my own oracles sometimes fail me. Alas*.) OTOH, some folks I play with like it when oracles give them chunkier, more tinker-toy like bits, whole chunks of story ready to be slotted into play. <br/><br/>So really, one of the things about designing an oracle is that you've got to know your audience, and have some idea of what it is you're trying to provoke them towards. Do you want them telling stories about this specific place and people (like I did with the Tribe 8 oracle, as writing an oracle for an established setting is an odd thing)? Do you want them telling a specific kind of story? Do you want to give them chunks of coolness about which to build their stories, or do you want to give them guides towards them building their own chunks of story?<br/><br/><br/>*Though I'm in good company on that one. I've sometimes gotten draws of Vincent's original oracles that made me make vexed and annoyed sounds.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180577/#Comment_180577" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-27T07:54:09+00:00" title="November 27, 2008  7:54AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tarot cards are a good idea, and I've always been really fond of the Everway cards, but the visual aspect seems not quite specific enough. Not enough to grab on to. Of course some cards are more "catchy" than others. The same goes with oracles. That medium ground between being told what you are playing and just general fluff is hard to achieve when creating oracles. I honestly think that as awesome as the anthology engine is, it sucks hard for established settings. You don't need oracles if everyone is familiar with the world. The setting itself IS the oracle that inspires the story. You simply need to cut slices of it out. Ok, let me rephrase; the anthology engine will work with established settings, but not with oracles, or at least not with oracles how we have seen them.<br/><br/>This hurdle is the main reason I abandoned my Batman hack. Now I'm thinking about an idea where each player brings an issue of a Batman comic to the table and maybe using a random page, line, or panel from the issue as a slice of setting to mine from for each session. It wouldn't be an oracle though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180597/#Comment_180597" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-27T12:05:34+00:00" title="November 27, 2008 12:05PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This earlier thread seems relevant:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5333" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5333</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180654/#Comment_180654" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-28T11:03:54+00:00" title="November 28, 2008 11:03AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 28, 2008 11:04AM by Dave Younce.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Oh, and, hello Abulafia people, ORACLES HAVE 52 ELEMENTS.</blockquote>\nEr, no, they don't. Oracles intended to be used with playing cards have 52 elements. Oracles without that limitation are as big or little as the author desires (besides, having written an infinite <a href="http://www.random-generator.com/index.php?title=Fantasy_Oracle_Maker" rel="nofollow">52-item Oracle generator</a>, I no longer feel constrained to keep other Oracles to that limitation).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Melinglor</cite>Both are a blind 'pull" from the Abulafia generator, though one of them had to be re-drawn because of duplicate entries (a recurring problem, fine folks of Abu!)<br/></blockquote>\nI know. I've brainstormed a little without seeing the best way to fix that in the current code, but I know it should be done and it'll happen eventually. And pertaining to your examples, it is worth noting that the Shakespeare one was written for IaWA, the Modern Occult one, if I recall, was merely written by people interested in using Oracles for some other game (presumably as random color generators).<br/><br/><br/>When I design an Oracle, I use a worksheet laid out according to the following method (refined from the method I was using in the thread Roger mentioned):\n<table border="1"><tr><th></th><th>People</th><th>Relationships</th><th>Places</th><th>Events/Objects</th></tr>\n<tr><th>Topic 1</th><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>\n<tr><th>Topic 2</th><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>\n<tr><th>Topic 3</th><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>\n<tr><th>Topic 4</th><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>\n</table>\nwhere the Topics are things pertaining to the setting you're trying to evoke, and no box may be empty. If you <i>are </i>strictly trying for a 52-card Oracle, tie your Topics to your suits and make sure each topic/suit has precisely 13 in it. To follow Joshua's advice, I try to go heavy on the 'Relationships' (people who need each other), make sure my Places or Objects are tied to a person or a desire, and make sure my Events are pressure-builders. Stylistically, Bret's advice (and Vincent's examples) are excellent. I try to brainstorm past my usual 50-ish item goal, carrying the worksheet with me everywhere in my pocket and adding ideas as they come, and then whittle off less-potent entries later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180658/#Comment_180658" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-28T12:04:26+00:00" title="November 28, 2008 12:04PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 28, 2008 12:05PM by JuddG.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My suggestion for an Oracle checklist for quality would be:<br/>\n<br/>\n* Is there future action implied or stated by the oracle?<br/>\n* Does it avoid being too specific to allow the reader to "twist" the meaning in a cool way?<br/>\n* Does it connect to a character or group?<br/>\n* Does it blend with other Oracles in the set well?<br/>\n* Does is create a sense of past, present, and future?<br/>\n* Is it open to creative interpretation by the reader?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe examples from the Shakespeare and Modern Fantasy lists above had some that referred to a single event either in the past or the present that seemed to stagnate beyond its resolution.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe duty of a good oracle is to get the reader(s) thinking of ways to put the piece into the whole in a way where the oracle both fits well but reinterprets the standing of the developing situation emerging from the prior Oracles.

See, on the Abu site, they're both filed under "In a Wicked Age/Oracles," so it's natural to have IaWAappropriate expectations for their utility. Also, Abu has random generators for all kinds of things besides Oracles, right? So if a particular list doesn't function as an Oracle, wouldn't it be best to file it elsewhere? (and heck, I don't know who wrote that particular one, but it seems that if they called it an "Oracle," they intended it to be one, and thus it's subject to criticism <i>as</i> an Oracle.)<br/><br/>But hey, this doesn't need to become a critique of Abulafia, which is awesome and jam-packed with juicy goodness.

The lesson for this thread is "Write an Oracle that is designed to work with the Anthology Engine, not one that just has elements or characters you think would be interesting in a game."  <br/>3) I try not to reclassify other people's generators unless I have to.

Most wars in western Medieval times through the late 19th Century were fought in Spring and Fall, mainly due to the debilitating heat and discomfort of wearing armor and fighting all day even in temperate climes. Armor goes away (or gets lighter, in more modern ages), wars can be fought almost year-round (but winter is still a bitch, and summer is still a bitch--ask the Germans in Russia or the US in Vietnam).(/Aside)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181494/#Comment_181494" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-04T08:52:13+00:00" title="December  4, 2008  8:52AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well I play that the card chosen by the winner doesn't have to correspond to the oracle used, and the winner chooses the proportions.
