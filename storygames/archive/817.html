                    During my vacation in Tanzania, I had plenty of time to think about game mechanics. Since Console III is a story-telling game, I need a way to let people take turns telling parts of the story, interrupt each other without stomping all over the story, etc. Here's what I came up with.<br/><br/>At the start of the game session, one person (the expert for the current region) has "the controller." This can be represented by any object; ideally, it's an actual physical game controller, like from an NES. That person starts telling the story for that session. Whomever has the controller is called the "narrator."<br/><br/>Narrators start with five minutes of time that is theirs and theirs alone. Others may request to interrupt (see below), but the narrator doesn't have to let them break in, even to activate role abilities.<br/><br/>To interrupt, the other players hold up their hand in different ways: one finger says you want to interject a quick comment or put a detail into the scene, two fingers says you want to speak for a particular character ("v for voice"), and the whole hand says you're requesting the controller. It's up to the narrator whether you get to do any of the above before the 15-minute mark.<br/><br/>Players can also hold up a closed fist, which *must* be allowed to break in any time after the initial five minutes have passed. This means you're activating a character's Role Ability (see <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=705&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">previous post</a>). The narrator can decide whether he or the activator gets to describe what happens because of the role ability.<br/><br/>After fifteen minutes, the narrator *must* turn the controller over to someone else, who then becomes the new narrator. The old narrator gets a token. You can't give the controller to someone with a token, though people with tokens can still break in with quick comments, voices, and character abilities. If a narrator passes the controller before the 15-minute mark, it still yeilds a token. Once everyone has a token, everyone loses their tokens. In short, everyone gets a turn.<br/><br/>I *think* it will work, but I need to playtest it. If anyone has ideas, comments, or stuff that I missed, let me know. I may also fiddle with the times.<br/><br/>--Colin                </div>

                            I've played in game like this before. The GM had fifteen minutes of time that they could use for whatever. From fifteen to thirty minutes, the GM could hand off at whatever time they wanted.<br/><br/>However, that was D&amp;D. Everything else was the same. Each player was a GM at least once and had their own PC.                        </div>

                            The times do seem a bit long. I'm not sure how you really handle conversation beyond: "..."<br/><br/>If you want to ape console games, then what about some sort of limited decision opportunity? "I've lost my watch, can you help me find it?" "A: Certainly, I'll search high and low until I find it." "B: Maybe. What's in it for me?" "C: *draw and fire*"<br/><br/>Maybe you need a different way to limit story control beyond just time. For instance, Soap allows players one sentence at a time. <br/><br/>Enjoy your vacation, and take pictures.<br/><br/>MDK                        </div>

                            Q: Did it work okay?<br/>A: It worked okay. Everyone at the table had been a GM before. However, it was the end of a long Gameday or Gameweekend, and as such ...<br/><br/>Q: Was there actually a plot behind it all?<br/>A: And as such, we were just messing around and made no attempt to keep the story very coherent. The last time I participated, I ended the game with a Djinni running D&amp;D Trivia Jeopardy with the players using their HP to bet on questions. I used the DMG and just asked trivial things they could have known.<br/><br/>Forced timed narration sucks, in my opinion. Framing a scene when you have something in mind can be wonderful.                        </div>

                            Rossum: Conversations can work just fine; people can be voicing characters back and forth even when someone else is the Narrator, as long as they have his permission. The Narrator can probably also put out a call for someone to voice one of the Main Characters, so he/she can voice a major supporting character.<br/>

Mark: Are you sure it wasn't Efreet Trebek?<br/>

I could say that everyone gets to talk long enough to increase the Plot Bar one pixel (there are certain actions that do increase the Plot Bar, and others that don't), but I don't want to force everyone to make plot. Maybe I'll add in the option of a "pass," where you take a token and immediately hand off the controller to someone else.                        </div>

                            You continually surprise me, Colin. A plot bar sounds wondrous for a Console game.<br/><br/>&gt;_&lt; I had a hard enough time dealing with the laughter of my whipping out a Jeopardy game to begin with, now it's gonna get worse with the next retelling.<br/><br/>A pass sounds like a good idea. Maybe it will allow for an extra or free usage of a character ability or something. Then your narrators get to do what they like, and the not so narrators feel like they've gotten something for free?                        </div>
