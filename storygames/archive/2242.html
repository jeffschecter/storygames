<p>There are these <a href="http://web.mac.com/rsdancey/iWeb/RSDanceyBlog/Blog/C44E7E19-26A7-4C05-89B8-15803410A740.html" rel="nofollow">predictions for the game industry in 2007</a> we've all seen linked from John Kim's LJ and from the Threads To Watch thread here. In it, Ryan Dancey talks about hobby games, meaning games that require a lot of out-of-game setup which players find as enjoyable or as necessary to the play experience as the actual play itself. He claims that hobby games are in decline.</p>
<p>This isn't all gloom and doom, if for no other reason that maybe a hobby games industry should be allowed to die, to allow everyone to become hobbyists again instead of obsessing over international recognition. I'll allow other people to argue over whether story games are doing exactly that, in another thread.</p>
<p>But I'm thinking that we may have seeds for a new kind of game, similar to RPGs, but not hobby games as Dancey defines them. We've seen several threads about cutting down prep time, aiming for the goal of zero-prep. Open the book, write some stuff down quickly, then start playing. There's a couple ideas out there i like as potential components of "non-hobby RPGs". For example, although I haven't played Tony Lower-Basch's <em>Capes</em>, I read up a little about it and like the Click and Lock method of character creation, particularly the part about crossing out and replacing one item on each half of the character for quick customization. It's clearly evolved from D&amp;D's race and class system, but makes things quicker, and has potential for other applications. Like: what if you combine "medical condition" and "personal situation" halves to create a conflict for a Medical Center/St. Elsewhere-style game?</p>
<p>Another component: playmaps. Lots of people have been investigating using common playsheets to create more of a boardgame feel. I think this idea hasn't been properly exploited yet. I'd like to see the playmaps become more than just a place for group notes and maybe actually let the playmap alter play in a way <em>only</em> a map could, like using where game tokens, dice, or coins land on the map to create new information.</p>
<p>I also like games like <em>InSpectres</em> putting the basic rules on the character sheets so that the game book is used as a training manual, then abandoned.</p>
<p>What I would like to see here is: more brainstorming. What would the non-hobby successor to roleplaying games look like? What tools already exist that could be developed further to create a new game platform?</p>

                            Funny, but when reading Dancy's article, I thought, "Gee, he's not thinking of Story Games, then, since they don't require all the prep. So no surprise we're not going to have the problem that the 'industry' has!"<br/>

<p>I don't know, it kind of varies. Many story games seem to have a lot of prep, although there are notable exceptions. It's those exceptions I'm interested in, and how they could develop into a separate platform.</p>
<p>Dancey defined "platform" a little unusually as well.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>By "platform" I mean a type of game that is disinct, like RPGs are distinct from collectible card games, which are distinct from miniatures games.  Typically, a platform is a combination of a style of play, a type of component, and a sales &amp; marketing engine.</p>

<p>I understand the style of play and type of component, but I'm not sure what he means by a sales &amp; marketing engine here.</p>

                            He's probably writing more about what White Wolf did as he write here:
<blockquote>White Wolf was once the shining hope of the industry.  When they released Vampire: The Masquerade in 1991, they did the impossible:  They got a whole new group of people to enter the roleplaying hobby en masse without cannibalizing any pre-existing business, and that group included a roughly equal number of men and women -- addressing in one swoop a critical failure of all previous entrants in the category. </blockquote>
With the rpg hobby market shrinking, it makes great sense to market and sell elsewhere. I think this new product needs to end up with shelf space at the 'Marts and on game tables in the big book stores.<br/><br/>EDIT:

Here's what I wrote previously: <br/>- No prep.<br/>- Easy to learn the basics or it doesn't take twenty minutes trying to explain how to play. â€œAppealing and quickly playable.â€ â€œFew minutes to learn, lifetime to master.â€ Not â€œrules-liteâ€ or â€œdumbed-downâ€<br/>- Add a board or some physical representation of the imagined space. "What kind of game is it?" "Oh, it's a little like a board game?"<br/>- Lose the term "role-playing." It's a game.<br/>- Somehow reduce or remove a central power figure or no GM.<br/>- Include more items to spark creative imaginings or you don't have to make stuff up and play pretend.<br/>- Shorter playing time, and no expectation of multiple session play.                        </div>

                            Here's my platform prediction:<br/><br/>A toy based collectible game. The toys are sold through vending machines/gumball machines at a price point of a round a buck. Potentially the rules are free, or even better, only acquired by collecting "points" and sending them in for you free rulebook. Even better possibility-Multiple different rulebooks for use with the toys.<br/><br/>The grocery stores love you. The parents love you, because a low price point gives the illusion that little money is being spent. You've created a self-perpetuating loop. Congratulations.

In the world that Ryan Dancey operates in, any given product is defined by what it does (play), what it's made out of (components), and how you get it to the consumers (marketing).  A CCG product is different from a non-collectible card game product because while play is roughly the same and the components are very similar, the means by which the producing company gets it into the hands of players is vastly different.<br/><br/>So it seems that by "platform" he means "kind of product."                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bryan</cite>I've seen vending machines selling card based games, so the toy based isn't that far fetched. Is it really all that different from card based collectible games though?</blockquote>
Not that different, although the idea of having multiple game systems for use with the same pieces is, as is the idea of having the pieces being valued seperately from their use as game objects ( which is secondary).<br/><br/>Mostly though it's a price point and access-to-new markets strategy, rather than a grand revision.<br/><br/>Try to imagine those Homies toys. Ever seen them? sort of Latino Gangsta Smurfs, sold in vending machines. They're collectible, have no game attached, and have had multiple editions. Theye are valuable as collectibles and have created secondary markets. After a certain length of time, retired collections are re-issued by way of multipacks in toy stores at a higher price than individual homies, but without the random factor, making a second round of sales.<br/><br/>Take that bit above. Now, throw a little circular cardboard token in the "egg" with the homie. It has a website address and says "1 homie-buck" or something similar.<br/><br/>Now, just like the much beloved Camel Cash that used to be in my cigarette packs, the kiddies can get <i>stuff<b></b></i>- loot! things that arrive in the mail! woo-hoo! All they need is enough homie-bucks.<br/><br/>Of course, all of this is freebie stuff, so quality can be somewhat less. One of the freebies is a game to play with our homies ( or really whatever alternative we're positing). Who can bitch about it being an old-school 60 page soft-cover? No one, that's who, even when we price it at 30 Homie-bucks.<br/><br/>So what is this game? Who knows? What do you want it to be? A story-game? An rpg? A tactical wargame? A cheap fold out board game? Screw it- make one of each and make each one cost 30 Homie-bucks. Hell, send 'em some dice and a nice box for it, too. If people really like it, be sure to let the produced units run out to create scarcity. Let the secondary market build up to crazy levels.<br/><br/>Then re-release it in a slightly nicer form for real dollars at the toystore. Hopefully, you should have the system kinks worked out by now, since all those nice kiddies have been acting as beta-testers for you. Bonus points for a November release.<br/><br/>Mwahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!<br/><br/><i>This has been your "Komrade Bob as evil Pulp Villian" moment for today.</i> </div>

<br/>This is definitely what I'm trying with <a href="http://www.catchyourhare.com/files/The%20Prince%20v2%5b1%5d.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Prince</a>, although I'm not sure that I'm entirely on the right track.  I'm not sure that it's an entirely new "platform" like what Dancey's talking about (in fact, I suspect that he had something very specific in mind when he wrote that), but it's very unusual approach to RPG design.  I would love to see more people pursuing this sort of thing.  My dream is that I'll some day have a small shelf packed with little games like this, I'll be able to give them to non-gamer friends as gifts, and I'll be ably carry around a small game-pack in my bag, so I can sit down with my friends at a coffee shop and play a round with no prep.                        </div>

                            Honestly, I think the distribution thing is less important than the audience.  After all, look who sells CCG games now: not just game stores but comics shops, places that used to sell baseball cards, bookstores, Wal-Mart, everyone.  If you build an audience for something, stores will decide to carry it.  Beside, having we been talking about the end of traditional distribution for the past 5 years?  Sell stuff through your own internet store.  Deliver the components electronically and let people print them out themselves.  Boo-yeah!<br/><br/>As for what the "new school" games will look like, I think everybody's on the right track here.  I definitely think it's not a question of if but who and when.  Game designers have learned a great deal from each other in the past 5-10 years, and so I have faith that many people will eventually start making games that fall along the boundaries that currently separate various game genres, including:<br/><br/>- Board Games<br/>- CCGs<br/>- Roleplaying<br/>- Larps<br/>- Interactive Fiction<br/>- Fan Fiction<br/>- MMORPGs<br/>- Video Games<br/>- Cosplay<br/>- etc.<br/><br/>Syncretism is pretty clearly the future.                        </div>

                            Dancey wants the end to come for the industry, really, really badly. It colors the way he sees everything. But! One of his predictions - that WizKids will be out of the hobby-games channel by year's end - is supported by WizKids' recent move to eliminate a couple of its distributors. So maybe he just had inside knowledge there... or maybe he is not completely insane.                        </div>

JD's got it in one.<br/><br/>Why anyone would still take Ryan Dancey seriously is beyond me.  When, exactly, has Dancey been *right* about anything before?<br/><br/>[Edit: For a big example of where the guy's head is at, two posts up from the prediction one has him still pimping d20 as a core system for any new RPG publication.]                        </div>
