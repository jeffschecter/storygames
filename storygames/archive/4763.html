It's not bad, exactly, but the software the board's running on makes baby Buddha cry.<br/><br/>Blue -- glad to hear Alley Cat Games is already getting some local support, I just helped get their retailer account set up recently.  <br/><br/>I hate responding to these sorts of things by tooting my own horn, but Spirit of the Century <i>is</i> a good "foot in the door" game for almost any store looking to carry IPR's stuff.  I talked with both Endgame and Black Diamond Games out in California when I was out there recently and the in-store behavior definitely shores that assertion up.  Gary at Black Diamond pointed at three games -- Spirit of the Century, Dogs in the Vineyard, and Burning Wheel Revised and said basically "the sales I get on these games make the risks I take on all the other games on this indie shelf affordable".  So I'd encourage Alley Cat to build their success around that set -- I'd definitely add some of the other big recognizables to that list, such as Prime Time Adventures, AGON, maybe a couple others.<br/><br/>If you're looking merely for a product selection, IPR's already gotten Chris from Endgame to weigh in on that front, with a buyer's guide:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/home.php?cat=297" rel="nofollow">http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/home.php?cat=297</a><br/><br/>Burning Wheel Revised isn't on that list (but Burning Empires is) and, regardless, it's an excellent core.<br/><br/>As far as what you, the consumer, can do to support that store, it's this:<br/><br/>- So long as you're OK with the idea that your money's going more to the store than the publisher, shift your buying patterns so you start getting your IPR products through special orders at your local store.<br/><br/>- Don't just buy the games there.  Play the games there.  Work with the store to do in-store game events.  Run demos there of the ones you like, and let the store know you're going to be running them there so they can try to have stuff in stock.  Great sales can occur when someone plays a game, likes a game, and then goes over to get their own copy of the game.  Your part in this is called "creating a local culture of play" and it's what Endgame does *so* excellently, and is why their IPR-based sales as a whole are highly competitive vis a vis their RPG section as a whole.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107273/#Comment_107273" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-07T14:04:58+00:00" title="November  7, 2007  2:04PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe IPR should ship a retailers starter set in a restockable POS display.<br/><br/>Also, I've had some discussions about indie games at my FLGS and they might be curious.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I talked with both Endgame and Black Diamond Games out in California when I was out there recently and the in-store behavior definitely shores that assertion up. Gary at Black Diamond pointed at three games -- Spirit of the Century, Dogs in the Vineyard, and Burning Wheel Revised and said basically "the sales I get on these games make the risks I take on all the other games on this indie shelf affordable". So I'd encourage Alley Cat to build their success around that set -- I'd definitely add some of the other big recognizables to that list, such as Prime Time Adventures, AGON, maybe a couple others.....<br/>As far as what you, the consumer, can do to support that store, it's this:<br/><br/>- So long as you're OK with the idea that your money's going more to the store than the publisher, shift your buying patterns so you start getting your IPR products through special orders at your local store.<br/><br/>- Don't just buy the games there. Play the games there. Work with the store to do in-store game events. Run demos there of the ones you like, and let the store know you're going to be running them there so they can try to have stuff in stock. Great sales can occur when someone plays a game, likes a game, and then goes over to get their own copy of the game. Your part in this is called "creating a local culture of play" and it's what Endgame does *so* excellently, and is why their IPR-based sales as a whole are highly competitive vis a vis their RPG section as a whole.</blockquote>\nThanks Fred for your comments!

I confess this is all pretty foreign territory to this avowed miniatures gamer. I remember seeing Spirit of the Century at Origins, so I was familiar with that title...but the rest has been all new.  My first IPR order was modest, a) to test the waters so-to-speak and b) because shelf space is limited. There will be some physical reconfiguring going on at the store come the new year to accomodate more RPG products (indie and mainstream) which have been doing better for us than expected.<br/>\n<br/>\n@Anna (wundergeek), I'm doing my best to make sure that Alley Cat "suck monkey balls". Hopefully we're succeeding. But we're still 3-1/2 months young and I'm learning something new everyday! I welcome any suggestions and feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nJeff <br/>\n(dang, just realized I should have registered here as Top Cat!)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115801/#Comment_115801" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-21T07:45:50+00:00" title="December 21, 2007  7:45AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good to see you, Jeff! <br/><br/>I visited Alley Cat a couple weekends ago, and I was beyond impressed. The Top Cat was super friendly, and-- I know this is a weird thing to say about a store, but you know how game stores can be-- the store smelled good, was clean, had awesome decor, and a good selection of products. Once holiday craziness stops I'm going to see if I can run some playtests there, and when the IPR shipment comes in, I'm definitely going to have to pick up a book or two.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115825/#Comment_115825" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-21T08:32:20+00:00" title="December 21, 2007  8:32AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeff, don't hesitate to wave a flag and ask for help if you need it.

It usually includes some small posters and one of each of our line. That way, if it sells, you can easily replace it and maybe get a community going. HinterWelt Enterprises products are available off our site and through distribution at Key20.<br/><br/>Good luck with the store.<br/><br/>Edit: A piece of advice, remember lighting and put some thought into it. In my second store we went with track lighting and it made such a difference. We then rolled it back to our first store and put in new lighting there and saw an almost 30% increase in sales. Very effective.<br/><br/>Bill Corrie<br/>bilbo@hinterwelt.com<br/>HinterWelt Enterprises                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff%20Cope" title="Jeff Cope"><img alt="Jeff Cope" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff%20Cope">Jeff Cope</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115909/#Comment_115909" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-21T13:06:12+00:00" title="December 21, 2007  1:06PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 21, 2007 1:11PM by Jeff Cope.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            thanks Bill, I'll drop you an email in just a moment...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe've got track lighting that came with the space (one of the reasons we loved the space we found).
