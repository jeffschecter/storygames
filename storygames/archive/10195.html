I am still quite a bit confused on how encounters (if they even happen) during the civilization phase with other monsters work.  Can anyone play through an example of some of that stuff and post pictures for the ignorant masses like myself? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n<br/>\nI know this isn't a complete play, but, I do plan on posting updates, and even this little bit, it's a wonderful way to pass some time, and as silly as it may sound, even this bit is fun.  I even started to make up story as I went along, like the reason they changed their barracks to be in the bottom left instead of continuing to the right is cause the dwarf living in the right most barracks complains of nightmares and scratching on the cavern walls xD<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, would love to hear more, might even fire off an e-mail for clarification on these rules to Tony and see if he has time to enlighten me <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jlcsusara" title="jlcsusara"><img alt="jlcsusara" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jlcsusara">jlcsusara</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226428/#Comment_226428" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-21T02:18:46+00:00" title="August 21, 2009  2:18AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A great start!

I spent a bunch of time worrying about whether I was doing it "right" or exactly how the rules are supposed to work. And then I realized that it doesn't actually matter. I'm playing it to have fun mucking around in a dungeon. I don't need the same social contract common ground that RPG rules are normally supposed to provide. If I bend the rules, or interpret them creatively because I think that outcome is more fun, I'm doing it right! It was tremendously liberating. So just pick a way of handling encounters that works for you, and have fun with it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226504/#Comment_226504" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-21T09:26:43+00:00" title="August 21, 2009  9:26AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool dungeon! Albert's got it right; there's no really wrong way to do it. That said, there are a few tricks to use.<br><br>When your Dwarves encounter primordial monsters, each monster kills one Dwarf, before getting killed itself. If the Dwarves encounter an ancient Wyrm, the Wyrm takes 1 of their white beads, and then they leave it alone after that. These rules are in the Primoridal section, not the Civilization section, which is why they are easy to miss.<br><br>The size of the beads does make a difference, although you should be able to play at any size. Big beads will get crowded after a while. Different size sheets of paper work too. We played on a huge sheet about 2 feet square at Gen Con, and it worked great!                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226520/#Comment_226520" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-21T10:27:16+00:00" title="August 21, 2009 10:27AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yay, more dungeons!<br><br>If there's no more ore, I'm guessing your dwarves will start leaving.
