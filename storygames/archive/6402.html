Don't let them get bogged down with the initial equipment, though. Prepare maybe 2-3 possible clients, and some weird stuff they are concerned about - then you can run a few short missions.

At the table in front of everyone. Listen to Mike when he mentions to use only a few franchise dice, from my experience the default of 5 for a small starting franchise is perfect for a 3 hour session.<br/><br/>Then just go nuts! It just seems to come together really well.<br/><br/>When I ran it I found everyone got a bit carried away with the franchise creation so move on from there as quick as possible. Maybe let each person define one thing for the franchise. One thing I didn't do very well was stress die so maybe keep that in mind (I will be next time I run it).<br/><br/>Im sure you will have a blast.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mcellis" title="mcellis"><img alt="mcellis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mcellis">mcellis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141665/#Comment_141665" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-29T23:07:13+00:00" title="April 29, 2008 11:07PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 29, 2008 11:08PM by mcellis.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since your players are non-gamers the first thing to do is to make sure to keep the game grounded in the familiar. The first familiar part of InSpectres is that everyone has seen Ghostbusters and if they haven't maybe they shouldn't be playing InSpectres. If they've seen the movie the will have a pretty good idea of what they will be doing in your one shot.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second and probably more important familiar part of InSpectres is that everyone has had a crappy job. Whether it was at a fly by night start up, a job in some soul sucking office cubicle, as a tiny cog in some mega-corporate restaurant or retail machine, or a back breaking Dirty Job. Everyone has had one, so encourage them to bring that experience to the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally all the advice that's already been given is good. Keep the number of franchise dice low, and don't let franchise creation take more than 15 or 20 minutes. And definitely use the random client tables. Also remember that it's a comedy game so drive towards the funny. If your players are having a hard time coming up with zany or humorous narrations give them some suggestions or a little prodding to help make it fun and funny. And if that doesn't work Slime them! and call for some stress tests. Good luck, and have fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141669/#Comment_141669" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-30T03:01:30+00:00" title="April 30, 2008  3:01AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Specify that it's up to them to push the investigation forward - to come up with theories, and try stuff out.

That is, I think that creating employee positions, and rolling for equipment and all of that is actually a really important to play. I'd love to see a session where they never actually left the office.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy biggest advice, however, is to make it more sessions than a one-shot. Call it a "pilot" if you want... that is, if they don't like it, they don't have to play again. But keep open the idea that they might want to play the franchise more. Because the best parts of InSpectres (the tensions around the office that come from the budgeting) come about from multi-mission play. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141741/#Comment_141741" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-30T11:20:56+00:00" title="April 30, 2008 11:20AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike: Multi-session play is not an option, unfortunately. This is basically an annual "game day" when my not-gamers-save-one-guy group of friends convene to play RPGs for reasons of ironic humor. Honestly, it's kind of hard to explain. The *concept* of getting together to play an RPG is basically amusing to them. <br/><br/>In the past, the goal was to play old school games (1e, MSHRPG, FASA Dr. Who, GW 4e), but now I've pushed new-school story games, as they really fit the group well. I ran DitV one year, and everyone but the one gamer in the group genuinely enjoyed it.

No one was new to gaming, but one player was unfamiliar with anything that gave narrative powers to the non-GM players. We spent as long as required for franchise creation and had a blast during that segment. We played that out until no one really felt we were missing anything, and we went with the if you thought of it you roll it method, which is also lots of fun. I don't know how long we spent on that segment of the game, but however long it was it was worth it. We stopped when we couldn't really think of anything and we were just sitting there trying to think of something else. <br/><br/>We then played out a mission of I think it was like twelve dice (give or take two). Followed by a mission of twice our new franchise level. And then that was the end of our four hours.<br/><br/>We came up with the missions by rolling on the tables, which worked out well.<br/><br/>Like Mike says in a multi-session game you'll be driving towards creating tension of can we finish this mission? Do we bug out now or later? Are we going to go under as a company? Who's using all the resources and can you cut it out please? And then the, I want to invest the dice here, vs. I want to spend them here discussions.<br/><br/>But in a one shot, you won't get any of that. It'll be all about what kind of wacky stuff they can come up with, and how badly they screw each other over with the confessional, so be sure to push the confessional on them. Give them some good examples of it while explaining the rules.

That is to say a 5 or 6 should get you closer to the mission's end. If it coincides with the character suceeding beyond their wildest dreams, that's fine. But the narration must push forward the plot first, and narrate a flashy success second. That's the one thing I keep having to remind new players of when playing InSpectres.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
