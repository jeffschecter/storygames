What was initially a game about DESTROYING the ring is now becoming a game about dealing with the power of the ring. Coming to terms with what must be done.<br/>\n<br/>\nJudson came up with some interesting mechanics for temptation tonight and I'm still wrestling with what you DO in the game at the moment.... what was very LINEAR, may become an open ended game.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy connundrum at this juncture is this... if the game is about a RELIC of power (set in any era), the risks and rewards become obvious. And the implementation of mechanics becomes easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, does this sound like a game that needs deliniated structure (go from point A to point B), or could I steal a page from Lacuna and design a smart game (well, as smart as I can) with no guidelines on what to do with it?<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize this breaks the format for posting to getting started, but I'm at a crossroads here on where to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts... on here or in private will be rewarded with cookies.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/algi" title="algi"><img alt="algi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/algi">algi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58646/#Comment_58646" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T02:38:12+00:00" title="March  2, 2007  2:38AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi!<br/><br/>I hope I understood your problem.<br/><br/>I am just reading again The Lord of the Rings and when I read it for the second time, I had the feeling that the whole book is about temptation. But I think you mustn't forget that it truly <i>is</i> a "roadmovie" going from A to B. And although Tolkien hated allegories, I think the Ringbearer's journey has to be parallel to a journey inside his head. (It is not a real allegory, of course.)<br/><br/>I propose that you use 2 "parallel" or better "perpendicular" (or orthogonal?) sets of variables or systems that intersect somehow. One is about how far are you on the road, the other is about "wich way" you went. In my opinion it has to be tricky: concoiusly you know you have to resist the power of the One Ring, but you don't know that the will to resist won't become the result of temptation. I think what happened to Frodo in the LotR is exactly what Gandalf was afraid of when he himself would get the Ring, but in a more abstract way.<br/><br/>Gandalf wanted to do good, but the Ring was evil, so he would want to get more power to do good - and that is exactly what a dictator is.<br/><br/>Frodo wanted to resist, but the Ring wanted to tempt him, so the resistance of Frodo itself became the tool of temptation.<br/><br/>The player wants to resist the Ring, so he wants to be on the far end of the road in the direction of successfull resistance. But what if he is on the wrong road? This looming question won't allow the player to go far on the road (won't dare to). On the other hand the player wants to go on the right road, and that would be the tricky part of the system: the GM (or the other players) through at the player concrete temptations that must be avoided, and these can be tricky.<br/><br/>I hope I'm making sense here. If yes, what do you think about it?<br/><br/>Gabor                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58651/#Comment_58651" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T04:05:35+00:00" title="March  2, 2007  4:05AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Physicaly going from Point A to B is not nessisary, but you have to go there metaphoricaly. So those who give in must get their wildest dreams but not what they really want/need/or at a cost they would be unwilling to pay. Otherwise why not roach yourself and be done. If you can get people to want to destroy themselves or the power you have a smart system that doesn't need anything else.<br/><br/>That said, making things work mechanicly for all characters in all settings is hard. I would suggest starting with one settiing where you can control as much as possible. if that works then try to open it up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity" title="Sempiternity"><img alt="Sempiternity" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.personal.psu.edu/bcp5010/stefan2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity">Sempiternity</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58818/#Comment_58818" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T15:23:08+00:00" title="March  2, 2007  3:23PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No cookie-worthy thoughts, just an observation:<br/><br/>It might be important to the elemental story, metaphorically, that 'destroying the ring' is equated with 'bringing it back from whence it came'...<br/><br/>As for mechanics, freeform &amp; linear inputs combined in a vortex of temptation is kinda the heart of <i>The Mountain Witch</i>...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
