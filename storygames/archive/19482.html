I was going to run this as a funnel, but 3/4 players were new to Dungeon World, and it seemed like not the best introduction, especially as a one-shot. Hoping to try the funnel rules soon with another group. <br/><br/><b>(Spoiler warning, I guess.)</b><br/><br/>We rolled up a pretty standard "motley band of murder hobos" party, with a knowledge-seeking elf wizard, a big dumb barbarian, a dwarven cult cleric, and a sketchy, evil halfling thief. It turned out from the questions that they were pretty much tomb raiders, and the prospect of rescuing kidnapped villagers was incidental to their presence in Meerhold. I used the In Medias Res starting point, but I read out a combination of the Background and the Traditional Intro to set the stage.<br/><br/>They fought back an initial group of Servants with the Barbarian taking most of the damage. The cramped, single-file catacombs provide interesting opportunities that I wish I had stressed a bit more, but it worked out okay, with the barbarian taking the brunt of the damage but everyone chipping in to take them out. In the course of the battle I had one of the Servants "burn out" to foreshadow coming badness. The wizard discerned that this was no ordinary haunting - somebody else had entered the catacombs and was raising these flaming skeletons. Looting a mummy, the barbarian found a sigil shaped like a strange bird-like claw and incurred Hvitr's disfavour. The cleric (due to a missed Spout Lore roll) completely mistakenly identified it as a Phoenix Talon that would resurrect a recently-dead corpse.* <br/><br/>Through his Guidance ability, the cleric's god pointed the way to St. Sigrid's tomb. The barbarian, already on Hvitr's bad side, got blasted by St. Sigrid's Fire opening the sarcophagus and vowed vengeance against Hvitr. This didn't pan out too well for him - while looting the sarcophagus, he got zapped touching the spear, losing the last of his HP and promptly failing his Last Breath roll. The cleric, fully believing that the claw would bring his companion back to life, jammed it in his chest. To keep everyone in the game, I decided that the claw would turn the barbarian into a kind of golem, under command of the cleric, allowing the barbarian to keep playing for a while at least.<br/><br/>Running out of time for the session, I let them find their way to the Hindrance. By this point, my Portents dictated that Thorde Skul was already in the Library. While the rest of the party had a frustrating run-in with the vampire bat (which I realized too late wasn't really intended for direct confrontation), the wizard got separated and tossed in the pit with the villagers. This all lead to a close-quarters battle with the wizard on one end of the corridor, the villagers in the middle surrounded by cultists, and the other three party members bringing up the rear. Having freed the villagers and learned a bit more about what's going on, the party made the difficult decision to rest for an hour to regain spells. We decided to make this a two-shot and stopped for the day, meaning that next time, Skul has almost definitely found the Book of Rains and is headed to the Caldera.<br/><br/>*I use the house rule that on a Spout Lore miss, I tell the player a completely false bit of lore, and if they act on it or convince others to act on it, they get to mark XP.<br/><br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed reading and running the module a lot and I look forward to seeing what happens next. The layout is wonderful and really easy to use, and the information is right in the sweet spot between open-ended and defined, making it perfect for pick up play.<br/><br/>General feedback:<br/>- It's a bit unclear at times what is "player-facing" information and what is background info to be discovered through play.<br/>- It would be nice if a specific portion of the Traditional intro was designed to be read as a lead-up to the In Medias Res intro, since it's necessary to explain the whole ancient ruin/kidnapped villagers thing. I did it on the fly, but it could be the first few paragraphs or something, with the specific description of the Fell moved to the end.<br/>- In a one-shot situation, I might just pre-draw a relatively small catacombs map, but the exploration move and random areas work well and if I had known it was going to be a two-shot I would have drawn it out longer.<br/>- I think the Vault of Hvitr could be a bit more fully integrated into the rest of the adventure, maybe with a tweak to the Portents - it seems significant, but Thorde and his minions must just pass it by without stopping, and I don't anticipate my players will pause at that point either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Lutes" title="Jason_Lutes"><img alt="Jason_Lutes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Lutes">Jason_Lutes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433952/#Comment_433952" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-17T07:18:11+00:00" title="June 17, 2014  7:18AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha ha!

After playing hide-and-seek with Thorde and his minions in the catacombs (losing one villager in the process), the party found their way into the library, where they had a pretty fantastic fight with the guardian (losing the rest of the villagers in the process). The claw from last week made another appearance when the barbarian-golem decided by sheer force of will to pull it out of his own chest and stick it in the guardian, in hopes of controlling it. It didn't work - the magic of the claw interfered with the golem's "programming" and caused it to go berserk. However, the removal of the claw from the barbarian-golem opening up a space for the barbarian's spirit to re-enter his body, restoring his free will. In a fun twist, though, the barbarian dedicated himself to Hvitr, having learned from the experience. Also during the battle with the guardian, the cleric died, and made a deal with death to destroy both the Staff of Cinders AND the Book of Rains in order to restore some kind of cosmic balance. After looting the archives (including a hilarious sequence in which the thief swiped the arcane magic tome before the wizard could get her hands on it), they finally realized that Thorde was probably up to no good, and chased him to the Vault.<br/><br/>They spent a bit of time figuring out one of the puzzle-doors, but by that point it was clear that the ritual was almost complete, and they went after Thorde to try and stop him. The barbarian, now an agent of Hvitr, almost one-shotted Thorde with Sigrid's Spear (which stayed stuck in him, amazingly), but he was left with enough HP to complete the ritual in the ensuing battle. With the flaming host of Ellorash wildly circling the mouth of the volcano as the lava rose higher and higher, the cleric and the wizard leapt across floating islands of solid rock to where the Book of Rains lay (the thief flew with the cloak of winds), while the barbarian held back some of the host. They planned to throw the book to the barbarian, since he was the only one faithful to Hvitr at this point, but in an unexpected twist the barbarian's player decided he couldn't read! Even though he had sworn to destroy it, the cleric embraced his inevitable death and decided to shout out the ritual so that the barbarian could perform it by ear. I treated this as an Aid move, which the cleric brutally failed... but redeemed with divine intervention... but brutally failed again! There was nothing for it, he was dead. But I decided to be nice and had Hvitr himself speak the rest of the ritual in the barbarian's heart, so he could complete it just in the nick of time (like, one more miss and the volcano would have erupted). The cleric went to his dwarven rest, glad that he embraced his own end and did not succumb to the cruel whims of Death, and the barbarian swore to stand guard at the sealed portal, for it would only hold for twenty years...<br/><br/>A great conclusion to the adventure, equal parts swashbuckling and epic.<br/><br/>General comments:<br/>- Further to my comment before, I think the trick with the Vault might be to introduce it earlier, giving them the opportunity to gain its treasures, and then have the party pass through again later if things go that way.<br/>- Like most RPG modules, a party with less than noble intentions can grate a bit against the pre-planned content, but there's not much you can do about that. No villagers survived this adventure.<br/><br/>Bonus! Here's the excellent character portraits my players did: <div class="instagram-video VideoWrap">\n<iframe allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" height="510" scrolling="no" src="//instagram.com/p/pUgacfSYZo/embed/" width="412"></iframe>\n</div><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Lutes" title="Jason_Lutes"><img alt="Jason_Lutes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Lutes">Jason_Lutes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434443/#Comment_434443" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-26T21:45:31+00:00" title="June 26, 2014  9:45PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Love the character portraits, along with the epic left turns your players took.
