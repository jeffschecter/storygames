Usually I "parse" 2-4 games at the same time, coming up with nascent situations, ideas for campaigns, and getting familiar with the rules. I usually do my reading for a few minutes a night (usually no more than 20 these days) before bed. At some point, I decide which one I want to run/play *next*, and focus on that game. <br/><br/>So, currently, here's what I'm parsing through, with the intent to run:<br/><br/><b>HELLAS</b>, aiming for a game with local friends by the end of the year.<br/>*Currently going over the ship rules, thinking of a way to get them into play without getting bogged down too much. Also, thinking of a solid situation to start with after the Big Setting Bang of "Sparta Blows Up".<br/><br/><b>Vampire the Requiem</b>, having been fired up by replaying the Vampire Bloodlines PC Game (which I believe is The Best Western-Style RPG for the console/pc ever, although I have not played Fallout 3 yet), and recent threads here where people recommended me some books (which I then ordered). Planning on running this for my bi-weekly group, either before or after our upcoming Castle Falkenstein game.<br/>*Currently thinking of a situation, I think I have it (characters are all members of or tied to The Invictus, which in Raleigh/Durham are actually the closest thing that there is to "good guys" in vampire culture, as opposed to The Invictus in other areas). Also going over the rules to see what's changed since Masquerade. Setting is far more open, and its ripe for the GM to sandbox in, but the possibilities can be quite overwhelming. I am very excited to Go Goth again, as it's been fucking ages since I've done some solid WoD gaming.<br/><br/><b>Empire of Dust</b>, which is simply a fun read. The constant tie-ins to the Dune universe can be a little jarring at times, but I plan on playing this in the next 2-3 months.<br/>*I'm just starting to break this in. I got through the character powers/backgrounds section, which I love (especially the "asterisk'd" backgrounds, which is an AWESOME mechanic to inject Story into the game and characters). Now I'm about to begin learning how the rules work.<br/><br/>And you? Whatcha reading, what are you thinking about it, and when do you plan on putting it into action?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183028/#Comment_183028" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-12T07:49:21+00:00" title="December 12, 2008  7:49AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mouse Guard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevin.weiser" title="kevin.weiser"><img alt="kevin.weiser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.finitesite.com/spiderlegs/wlkngI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevin.weiser">kevin.weiser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183030/#Comment_183030" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-12T07:53:51+00:00" title="December 12, 2008  7:53AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Our group is looking forward to playing Misspent Youth while we all take the time to really read and absorb Mouse Guard, then dive into that right after. I'm going to run 3:16 next weekend for a bunch of Storygames newbs, and that should be exciting too.  After MG, dunno. Maybe Dogs? Our group just discovered indie games, so we bought a TON of them, but due to scheduling have only gotten a chance to play two of them so far (Grey Ranks and Don't Rest Your Head).<br/><br/>So i guess you could say what we're parsing and planing to play is: Indie Games.  ALL OF THEM.<br/><br/>Small note on Vampire: Bloodlines, yes, it's fucking fantastic. Everyone should play this game. It's only 15 or 20 bucks on steam. Download the fan-made patches if you haven't. Is it better than Fallout 3? I think so. The dialog, quests, and storyline definitely is. As a small bit of Irony, Troika, creators of Bloodlines, are composed of the 3 main guys behind the original Fallout: Tim Cain, Leonard Boyarsky and Jason Anderson.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blue" title="Blue"><img alt="Blue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Blue">Blue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183031/#Comment_183031" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-12T07:54:04+00:00" title="December 12, 2008  7:54AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm literally working through the idea of an LJ-run game of Scion.<br/><br/>Scions of various Chaos gods in a sort of A-Team meets 24 scenario.  24 posts over the course of a month with each post the equivalent of one hour of action.

The pilot, of course, gets to shine, but engineering and sensors have what appear to be interesting and important choices.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183069/#Comment_183069" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-12T11:07:03+00:00" title="December 12, 2008 11:07AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 12, 2008 11:07AM by J_Walton.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just finished Bliss Stage last night, so I'm now in the mood for something slightly more trad, an "adventure game" of some variety.

A group of friends are playing the game and have invited me to join in. I currently play Magic with them and have fun, and I know they approach 4th in a way that I find completely alien to RPGs, so I'd be interested in playing with them. But, it's been years since I've read an instruction manual as long as D&amp;D, and I'm having trouble sticking with it. Also, it's really really involved in terms of just the quantity of rules. But the biggest hurdle for me is how I interpret the game, which is by and large a tale of genocide and racism. So on the one hand I really want to play with my friend, experience their playstyle, and experience what I consider, so far, to be top-notch rules.  On the other hand, the concept or premise of the game is horrifying to me, and those rules, they might be brilliant, but there are just so many of them. I'm a hundred and fifty pages in and they keep going.<br><br>And, as always, <i>Play Unsafe</i> is on my mind.

Maybe I should just use them, too much tinkering otherwise. <br/><br/><b><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=8278" rel="nofollow">Shell Shock</a></b> - I find much promise there, having wandered in the same regions with an early concept of my own, I think that the game as it is now lacks some guidance needed to play but I'm gonna give full feedback only after I've played it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183360/#Comment_183360" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-14T23:19:33+00:00" title="December 14, 2008 11:19PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 15, 2008 12:27AM by Wilhelm.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Mouse Guard</b>, I hope it will be similar enough to <b>Burning Empires</b> that once we have played a mini campaign in MG I can reread BE and actually understand how it is supposed to be played.<br/><br/>So I am sort of reading MG hoping that it will twist my mind enough that I can grook BE. :-)<br/><br/>MG looks great btw, but I'll have to get whatever has come out of the winter book already.  I saw some snowy pictures in the game and I don't want to spoil the comic.<br/><br/>* edit *<br/><br/>Also, I am feeling a bit conflicted regarding Burning Empires.  I generally don't think that I should have to WORK to understand a game, but BE has me hooked I will never find peace if I don't figure that game out and run it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183392/#Comment_183392" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-15T06:39:04+00:00" title="December 15, 2008  6:39AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Oh, also, if you're parsing something, rather than just a shortlist of games you're reading, I'd totally love to hear your thoughts on what about the game is currently in your headspace (something you're trying to sort out, a rule or setting element that's stuck on you, etc), how you're reading it, etc.<br/><br/>-Andy</blockquote>With regards to Black Cadillaces, there's a lot of bits in the rules. Cards and different kinds of dice and chips getting pushed around and played and risked and moved around on a map. Right now, I'm trying to figure out the rules. I haven't made it all the way through them, but I figure I'll have to reread this section a couple of times before I'm able to play, so I'm thinking about that and thinking about how to give meaningful feedback to Darcy about my experience reading the rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
