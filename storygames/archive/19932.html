It was my first experience with the system and overall, I thought it went pretty well. I had four players, three of whom have plenty of trad and some story-game experience, and one with only trad experience (though he played and enjoyed Swords Without Master and A Penny for My Thoughts in-between the two Cthulhu Dark sessions). <b>Spoilers for the scenario follow.</b><br/><br/>I always struggle a bit with spotlight management, and with two of our players being somewhat less assertive (Rosa's player and the new story-gamer who played Jonesy), I felt like I didn't give everyone enough time to shine. Some inebriation and fatigue in the latter half of the second session exacerbated that problem a bit- with Jonesy mostly dropping out of the story for the last forty-five minutes. I also wasn't feeling my best during part two, which made my NPC portrayals (my acting veers wildly from non-existent to hammy anyway) less consistent and interesting.<br/><br/>That said, all of the players got into their characters in fun and exciting ways. Hilary's player, the other "most likely to GM" of our group played his character with a fantastic arrogance and Jonesy latched on to him in a beautiful, if asymmetric, friendship. Dr. Laws ended up being the moral lynchpin of the story, especially after Hilary went mad at the Maiden House- it only took seven Sanity rolls to drive the Viscount insane. Dr. Laws was somewhat torn between Rosa (who became the voice of reason and was strongly opposed to Jack's arguments) and his fear for his brother Geoffrey. Rosa's conscientious influence led to the group allowing Geoffrey to perish in a pretty devastating scene.<br/><br/>I think I nailed the first session more than the second; I remember coming away from it feeling really energized and proud of some of the characters I'd portrayed. One of the problems I had in the second game was a feeling like I didn't give the characters enough agency. They followed a pretty linear path of investigation; besides how they react to the other characters and the mystery the only meaningful choices in the scenario come at the very end. This is part of the problem with running a scenario as opposed to the more improvisational style of GMing I usually prefer. <br/><br/>I threw as many interesting moments, images and characters as I could at them (and to be fair, the scenario is packed with them), but without the opportunity for really surprising or meaningful actions on the player's parts the only thing I can really build off of is the way the players portray those characters. That puts a lot of pressure on my ability to make the characters, locations and incidents already in the scenario as interesting, exciting and <i>personal </i>as I could make them. Not being at my best in the second game meant that things seemed a little flat to me.<br/><br/>The fact that the scenario really narrows down very quickly to those final choices is also problematic. Dr. Laws and Rosa both wanted to work on a way to break the Great Cycle for good. The way events drive after the Maiden House to the crisis about Geoffrey and from there straight to the decisions in the epilogues meant they didn't get to explore that as much as they wanted to. Not that the scenario as-written offers any real hope on that score anyway. They did manage to convince Mary to flee Manesty with the twins.<br/><br/>The lack of agency problem was worst with Hilary. He went insane a good thirty minutes before the end of the scenario; I allowed his player to continue playing him as insane. And while he did a really good job, it meant that he couldn't really play much of a role in the decision about Geoffrey and it meant he didn't really have a choice in the epilogues. Too much of his story in that second session was just his reactions to me portraying his brothers in his dreams, and later, his hallucinations.<br/><br/>In his epilogue (the first played out), the other characters came to see him (in the psych ward where they had committed him) when they knew his time was approaching. With some long-distance radio coaching from Jack, Hilary had managed to steal some broken glass and break free. They found him desperately trying to perform the ritual himself and failing. Remembering Geoffrey's pathetic death, Dr. Laws took pity on Hilary and performed the ritual, freeing his monstrous form. After seeing the monster, though, Rosa and Dr. Laws became even more ambivalent. Jonesy's time came next, he chose to join Hilary in the ground, though Dr. Laws met him at Castlerigg and tried to stop him. Rosa didn't show up that time, and in her epilogue, she chose to resist the call and died at home, proudly clinging to her humanity. Lastly, Dr. Laws followed the call to Castlerigg at his time and found Lisa and Bethany waiting to help him perform the ritual. He committed suicide to prevent them from doing so and with his dying breath urged them to do the same when their time comes.<br/><br/>The plus of running a scenario is that you get a consistent, focused story with an interesting and surprising through-line. The result was indeed focused and thematically tight; I even managed to foreshadow the ending a bit with the Blackstone bartender's frustration at Agatha Christie's plotting. But while I didn't get to ask the players if they were surprised by the twist at the Maiden House, I suspect they weren't really. I may have laid the clues on a little too thick. I also got a few details wrong with the timeline which made the plot not entirely make sense, but nothing that broke the game really. And the players latched onto a few red-herringish details that I couldn't pay off in a meaningful way, but that's pretty minor too.<br/><br/>I also never used the Cthulhu Dark rules about rolling against someone's success to create an interesting failure- given the bleak nature of the scenario I felt like it would almost have been cruel to do so. Especially since all the dice-rolling that I can remember was directly related to investigation or sanity (save a couple rolls by Rosa dealing with the antiques fair and some minor physical confrontations near the end). Still, it might have added more variety and suspense if I had done so (or more strongly encouraged the players to do so?)<br/><br/>Anyway, I still really enjoyed the game (and the adventure). I'd like to try running CD again sometime- but with a looser sort of scenario, maybe using the Dark Depths supplement to generate it.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441011/#Comment_441011" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-23T15:10:29+00:00" title="December 23, 2014  3:10PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the AP post.

I've run CD many times, but still face some the challenges you did. I think it's just part of having such a rules-light system. There are just a lot of places the GM has to wing it.<br/><br/>I also struggle with spotlight management and making the story as personal as possible. I think there's a huge outlay of mental energy with a system like this to fully engage the players by really personalizing it, as you said, and the whole game can suffer if you're just too tired, etc to really dig into it. (It's why I prefer to run games first thing in the morning, especially at cons, when my mind is freshest.)<br/><br/>Finally - I never use the "rolling against success" part of the rules. Even when I explained it up front to new players, no one ever used it. I think the game is too hard already; to add player versus player is more than most people can deal with. I think also, because there really isn't a complementary rule in either COC or TOC that players of those systems are not looking for it. <br/><br/>Please let us know if/when you run more CD.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada" title="Coalhada"><img alt="Coalhada" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada">Coalhada</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441382/#Comment_441382" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-13T01:39:54+00:00" title="January 13, 2015  1:39AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First of all, thank you for the AP post. Very interesting! <br/><br/>I've only run CD once - the scenario was the rather excellent <i>The Secret of Castrnegro</i>, and it went very well.  <br/><br/>I <i>did </i>use the "rolling against" mechanic, but only where a PC was explicitly being opposed or resisted by an NPC. So poking around the old curio shop, for example, was unopposed. Generally speaking, the players were always able to muster at least two dice by steering any conflict towards things they were good at, so while the opposed roll raised tension, I don't think-- <br/><br/>No, wait. I was about to say "I don't think they failed a single one of them", but they did. Near the very end, a desperate investigator tried to flee the town by holding up a delivery truck and accidentally shot the driver instead. <br/><br/>But anyway. <i>Generally</i>, the PCs succeeded even when opposed. <br/>The two players never rolled against one another, as far as I can recall. I think they sensed they needed to stick together.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amphigorist" title="amphigorist"><img alt="amphigorist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/877/nOZYIGACEOYYP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amphigorist">amphigorist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441402/#Comment_441402" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-13T11:21:13+00:00" title="January 13, 2015 11:21AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks everyone for the feedback. Interesting that the "rolling against" mechanic sees such light use amongst this small anecdotal sample. I like the idea of using it only when an NPC is opposing actions; if I run another session I'll probably try that.<br/><br/>Strangely, I did have some light PVP moments (in the sense of characters working at cross purposes) near the end, but we mostly resolved them as a sort of action/counter-action rather than opposed rolls. It worked okay, I thought, but I'm not sure why I did it that way. Just seemed like a natural ruling at the time; the rolling against rules did not occur to me at the time.<br/><br/>Something modestly embarrassing/amusing re: my hammy acting has stuck with me from the game which I failed to mention in my write-up. At one point in the second session I was portraying an especially desperate and terrified Geoffrey, and my devoted dachshund Sally (who had been comfortably napping in the seat next to me) became extremely alarmed and worried for me. It really made me hilariously self-conscious, not least because she kept jumping up to try and comfort me whenever I tried to power through and stay with it. Nothing like a dog to bring you back to earth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
