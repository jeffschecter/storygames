I'm not heavily into the map. But I chucked the guys a bone anyway.<br/><br/>The project as described doesn't seem to include any facility for exchanging virtual tokens, which would be really useful for Fate Points in <i>Spirit of the Century</i>, other FATE builds, and I guess a fair few other games. Perhaps if a few story gamers got into the closed beta and made a suggestion they would consider adding the capacity.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/><br/>Brett                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
