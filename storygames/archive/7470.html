Or is it a fantasy heartbreaker<br/>\nI've been mulling this question over and decided I needed some other peoples opinions.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrief background you can skip:<br/>\nI am currently working on two versions of an OD&amp;D hack. Well one is a hack the other is a rehack. I don't plan to do anything with these games other then put them up my blod for people to poke at. I needed a break from another game I am working on. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any thoughts or comments,<br/>\nara                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165992/#Comment_165992" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-28T16:02:42+00:00" title="August 28, 2008  4:02PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A fantasy heartbreaker is a very specific thing.
