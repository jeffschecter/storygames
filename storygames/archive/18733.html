They may seem different, but they got a lot in common. They may use different tools to achieve what they want, but it's important to see why and what they strive for. This thread is going to be an ongoing progress where I will take shards of these categories and, from time to time, present them and by doing that, hopefully to give a thoughtful moment.

All these points are crucial for roleplaying game too. When reading the first point, I remember what the improv guru Keith Johnstone wrote about how the school system destroyed the imagination by it's rigid structure. Not that the school is the only thing to blame - we also learn to self-censor ourself as part of becoming an adult - but the school plays a major part.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that we should play roleplaying games to become these points, as Eleanor Chase above, but roleplaying games <i>are</i> about these points. We must learn to break free from our self-censoring and become <i>original</i>. Play Unsafe (which took it from Impro) tells us that our ideas may seem unoriginal to us, but that doesn't mean that they are for the others. Your ideas will feel unique for me. And those ideas should be celebrated as much as you should be recognized as an original human being.<br/><br/>We need, during a session, to work as a group - to form a communication in how to play. To think as a group. To feel as a group. To co-operate in creating a story - or a sense of feeling - together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420414/#Comment_420414" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-20T09:29:38+00:00" title="August 20, 2013  9:29AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 20, 2013 9:40AM by Rickard.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought it was from Jeepform that I came upon the following, but I couldn't find it so I assume it was some kind of manifesto instead. One point in that manifesto told me that you should forget what you had learned and used and start from the beginning with each new project.<br/><br/>That's stupid.<br/><br/>If you learned something, then you should reuse it. Why reinvent the wheel? It was a stupid point in that manifesto ... or so I thought. I was reading a four page roleplaying game an hour ago and there was nothing that told me how to create a positive group feeling, nothing about how to describe the environment. All that "basic stuff" was taken for granted. If I do my own interpretation of the point in that manifesto: throwing away what you learned is a way to stop taking things for granted. Sure, you invented the wheel for the fourth time, but you haven't forgotten to tell the others to add the wheels to their vehicle.<br/><br/>My feeling is that a lot is left out in todays roleplaying games in terms of explaining how to play - yes, even "indie games" - and I can totally understand the feeling of the OSR movement. OSR is not my game style, but I feel that I can learn from going back to basics. To reconsider why we are including some elements of roleplaying games - I'm not only talking about certain game mechanics (ex. combat) - and to not forget to tell others the elements we normally take for granted. Somewhere along the line we lost to explain how to become flexible, sensible, original, and group-orientated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420417/#Comment_420417" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-20T09:41:32+00:00" title="August 20, 2013  9:41AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nothing to add, but watching with interest for now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy" title="TotallyGuy"><img alt="TotallyGuy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy">TotallyGuy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420432/#Comment_420432" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-20T13:05:37+00:00" title="August 20, 2013  1:05PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was reading some of Ben Robbin's Ars Ludi blog archive today when I realised that we know so little.

They help you get into character, forming relations with others (group dynamic), communicating the vision of the game, and much more. The drama teacher Viola Spolin was the first to introduce improv exercises as part of putting up a play. One exercise could be about one player (yes, she defines the participant as a "player") closing the eyes and <i>feel</i> the others on the stage. This increases the awareness of the other, which can create more relaxed and natural responses. It makes the player more <i>sensible</i>. Imagine this being used in team sports, where the players can <i>feel</i> the presence of the others on the court without actually seeing them. Group dynamic is something that becomes more and more popular, even in individual sports.<br/><br/>Keith Johnstone has an exercise to increase the awareness. Look around and notice the environment. Look at the people around you. Walk around and point at things but say something else. You can point at a chair and say "elephant" or at the wall and say "despair". Whatever comes into mind, say it. Don't hesitate. Do this for a while and then look around again. How are the colors? Are they brighter? More clear? How have the people changed around you? Your perception have increased. Research in human psychology have also shown that if you search for something while saying it out loud, you will spot the object quicker. According to Johnstone's experience, the opposite works too but for a more general awareness.<br/><br/>Doing exercises like this, in the beginning of a session, can be used to make the roleplaying group more aware of each other. Perhaps you start to notice how one person wants to cut in or how you get thrilled by the others' excitement. Perhaps you start to read and feel the other people, and sometimes predict what they are about to do, so you can adapt to it and and therefor create a steady flow as you all take part in a shared imagination.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420452/#Comment_420452" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-20T15:21:52+00:00" title="August 20, 2013  3:21PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Exactly Rickard, we're taking too much for granted when it comes to explaining things.

People has a tendency to classify from how something is executed, instead of what the purpose is of that execution. One example is movie and roleplaying games. To create chaos, movies make fast cuts and overflow us with information. If we were about to do the same thing verbally, it would take time and more be like slow motion. Instead, to create a chaotic feel in roleplaying games, you should leave out most of the visual descriptions.

That can help us taking roleplaying games in new directions instead of following the same old tracks. It's nothing wrong with the tracks but we can discover a lot more, and benefit from those discoveries. Finding new ways of play, new techniques, new sensations, and more.\n<blockquote>I could write lots more, the title <a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a> gave to this thread engages me very much,</blockquote>\nI would love hearing all kinds of thoughts, positive and negative, that this thread gives.

It's surprising how for example, I recall using LARP techniques like monologues and more on TTRPGs without having played a LARP in my life. There are an awful ton of things that as some point we make up or reinvent to use at the table and forget the next session. I agree that Techniques in general are easy to improvise withouth much preparation, most of them come out from different sources like movies, theather, television, books, comics, videogames, etc. But we don't consume the same things, so a technique, house rule or reference not may be familiar or "intuitive" for some people.<br/><br/>The techniques list is still growing, but once it's stable I'll make a comic to explain them, like <a href="http://www.shrikedesign.com/games/delve/resolution.html" rel="nofollow">this one David Berg used for his game Delve</a> hopefully it will be clearer than APs for explaining how to play an RPG.<br/><br/>About people experiencing different things from roleplaying, it's copletely true. I was amazed at how some people play cooperative story games or even trad games where players have heavy influence on scene framing or correcting the GM. Three years ago I thought old school was some sort of Paranoia-like TPKfest until I readed more about the style of play and talked with veteran old school players. You see, rulebooks today can give you everything you need to play but they still can't convey how players should behave to have fun nor why. AW is the one closer to that end, but it still doesn't reach it's full potential. It's derivates are even closer though.<br/><br/>However there's still something missing, for all I've tried I can't completely understand how AW is supposed to be GMed and I'm afraid that messing my own experience with it won't work. It might even ruin the intended game experience for the players. I get the principles, I've used them a lot before and it's quite useful to have them listed in front of you to remember that as a GM you've always many more options than it looks. Also, the principles will inspire you and the players to use a wider array of Techniques, which also has a quite interesting impact on the game experience. Moves do the same, they are a wonderful tool to add color to the game, personalize characters and bring unexpected twists to the action, instead of just letting the dice say yes or no.<br/><br/>Now, does this all means the hobby has lost it's core? No. It means it's core is bigger than we all thought. It's certainly bigger than our tables, our group and our experiences; it's amazingly diverse, has an incredible amount of hidden potential, and it's still getting lost between disputes, bigotry, an industry still too attached to routine (not even to it's traditions) and designers that insist of following that path instead of thinking how to open up the hobby for newcomers.<br/><br/>So please, write more about everything, everybody.

Looking at all the things that are called art today, you'll see this tag has done nothing good for any media. People who call<i> themselves</i> "artists" and use it as an excuse to make more money out of a form of expression, from the pockets of status-consumers, have really ruined the profession for all the creative people who just wanted to play, comunicate emotions/ concepts and feel free to feel.<br/><br/>So, right from the start, fuck the "Art" tag. Let other people call it "Art" if they feel inclined. As a game designer all I want to do is create something (bizarre, epic, humorous, dramatic, etc), have fun and share it with others. I've been illustrating for years, I'm good at what I do, but I don't consider myself as an "Artist". Your ego starts to ruin your work when you get to think of yourself as that.<br/><br/>Pells has a point: all the things on that list are intuitive. But then again, not all the things that fill the gaps and connect the things on that list are intuitive, otherwise that list by itself would be a game. We veterans can perfectly see how all those are part of the core of the game and make sense putting them together, but I'd bet my whole collection of RPG books that a newcomer wouldn't be able to put up a game that resembles exactly what we do, just from using all the things mentioned in that list.<br/><br/>Twenty years ago I readed an article in a local newspaper about roleplaying games. It explained some of the basics and showd an AP, it picked my curiosity. I heard about D&amp;D and watched the cartoon on tv, but in the end I couldn't make heads nor tails of what the game was supposed to be like, though I understand all the thing that are on the list were used together somehow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420508/#Comment_420508" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-21T13:58:39+00:00" title="August 21, 2013  1:58PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Role-playing games are no more theatre than they are novels, movies, paintings, textbooks, sculptures, ethos, critical essays, TV serials, or mathematical theories.<br/><br/>As in, one can draw lines between role-playing and any of those activities, but they are definitively and entirely _not the same thing_.<br/><br/>It's really common in the early days of a given medium that the critical analysis work will all make borrowed analysis using theories of more established media: i.e. when movies were getting their start, most of the theoretical work was done using theatre as a framework, with the idea that a movie camera is just a way of reproducing a theatrical performance easily.<br/><br/>But, of course, it's not. And when filmmakers started to realize this -- when they began to realize that there was more to their medium of choice than "more static theatre--" movies really began to flower artistically and critically and commercially. Doing this is hard -- the critical vocabulary must be made from scratch, and generally must be made by the artists involved, who have better things to do. But it's the only way to move forward creatively.<br/><br/>Why is that? Because when you adopt your critical language and frameworks form a different medium, you also adopt the aesthetic ethos of that medium. Ultimately, if you use theories that explain role-playing as a form of improv theater, you will end up at the conclusion that the highest form of role-playing is actually improv theatre. If you use theories that explain role-playing as a form of novel, you will end up at the conclusion that the highest form of role-playing is actually a novel. And so on and so forth, with all the things I mentioned above.<br/><br/>Such work can be useful, of course, but I would really love to have an aesthetics that centers role-playing games, rather than some other more established medium. I think we'll be stuck chasing our tail until we have that.<br/><br/>Because the highest form of role-playing is role-playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420510/#Comment_420510" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-21T14:20:30+00:00" title="August 21, 2013  2:20PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 21, 2013 5:53PM by Rickard.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can we all take this "What is roleplaying games" or "Is roleplaying games theater?" in another thread?

So on my home I composed a reply to <a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a>, encouraged to say my thoughts about "knowing little and learing more", but discussion overtook me. Still it seems somewhat relevant, so i will still include here and then reframe it to what I believe is closer to Rickards intentions:\n<blockquote>Looking at different tracks is fine, for example many books today have used techiniques deveopled for cinema. But it might be useful to stress the differences, too. Writing a play or a book maybe both writing, but technique and performance can be quite different.<br/><br/>In the same vein larps and trpgs may share roleplaying, but characters and attributes and fiction are present in movies, too? So acting == roleplaying?<br/>Along the same line, Vincent Baker has always insisted that his games belong in the same category as D&amp;D. And as  writer who wants to do different things I can understand why he wants this, in not to limit what he can do or is perceived to be able to do. OTOH, this might really hamper analysis, finding specific differences. And insofar reflection on differences in material and its attributes suffers, the development of craft and skill is hampered, too. Advances depend on luck and raw talent. <br/><br/>In other fields we have film studies, theater studies, and literary criticism with several subfields. (there is even a book on anime studies, a whole book can be fruitfully written on the differences between disney and japanasese animation) As a creator you might care to much for this, but it might prove just as fruitful for roleplaying to look at differences between "traditional roleplaying" and "storygaming" as this has proven to be for modern novel writers and anime creators.<br/><br/>So i am all for the different tracks, but we should be allowed to analytically divide the tracks. To give us tools and patterns that lessen what is not known about out hobby.<br/><br/>Maybe it's just what *i* need to do.</blockquote>\nI think what Rickard is looking for here is "tracks" of inspiration to learn from. <b>For me that includes theory, too.</b> Its why I feels somewhat justified posting the above.<br/><br/>Really, definitions and theories are not the enemies of creativity. For some, yes, but others like me it fuels a sense of possibility. For conservative thinkers like Habermas a theory might be the be-all-and-end-all of thought, but more recent philosophers recast theory as opening up tracks to explore.<br/><br/>Even when a designer decides to go against a theory, which is always possible, something he perceived as staid became the foil for new creativity.

Wikipedia writes the following about systems:\n<blockquote>A system is a set of interacting or interdependent components forming an integrated whole /.../<ul><li>    A system has structure, it contains parts (or components) that are directly or indirectly related to each other;</li>\n<li>    A system has behavior, it contains processes that transform inputs into outputs (material, energy or data);</li>\n<li>    A system has interconnectivity: the parts and processes are connected by structural and/or behavioral relationships.</li>\n<li>    A system's structure and behavior may be decomposed via subsystems and sub-processes to elementary parts and process steps.</li></ul></blockquote>When we talk about a system in roleplaying games, it's often a system of game mechanics that comes into mind. If I say "D&amp;D" you will think of attributes, feats, hit dice and similar. But a system is more than that. Wikipedia follows up on that: "The term system may also refer to a set of rules that governs structure and/or behavior." You also got a system within the group, sometimes called "social contract", but it's more than that. Five people around a table in a room creates a closed system. Each person in the room is a component in the system and each person has a relation to another. In other words, the system has interconnectivity. One thing I think is interesting in designing games is to take the group's system into mind, and make each participant become one component in the game's system. Because basically, that is what a roleplaying game system is. Nothing will ever happen before a participant adds input to the system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420761/#Comment_420761" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-27T11:02:27+00:00" title="August 27, 2013 11:02AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 27, 2013 11:44AM by Rickard.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I think is most important is the third point above: how the different components in the system interacts. When making a game, you want the game to create some sort of sensation or motivation. Perhaps you want the players to explore the world or compete against each other by using the game mechanics. If I told you to make a game where the players explore the world while competing against each other - you probably have an idea of how to make the game based on your experience with other roleplaying games. I think that's the wrong approach.<br/><br/>What you need is components in a system that interact and, from that interaction, a sensation will emerge. You will design for emergence. The philosopher G.H. Lewes said about emergence "Every resultant is either a sum or a difference of the co-operant forces; their sum, when their directions are the same -- their difference, when their directions are contrary." It doesn't matter if you are aiming for a tactical game or a game where you improvise a story together; you should still design for emergence. This is the hard part. How do you know what components that you should add to your game? How should you know what kind of relations the components should have with each other, so that the interaction is creating the emergence that you are seeking for?<br/><br/>I don't have an answer for that. Like Lewes also said: "The emergent is unlike its components insofar as these are incommensurable, and it cannot be reduced to their sum or their difference.", and that's why it's so hard to explain it. It's like describing how you can take any thought and then tell which experiences that lead up to that thought. It's impossible. We got The Big Model that only works for a <i>certain kind</i> of roleplaying. We got Marc LeBlanc's Mechanics/Dynamics/Aesthetics, where he found a couple of very general gaming components that can interact with each other. We got LARP theory where (can't remember the name) tells us that to reach immersion, we need character, setting and situation to relieve each other in a continuous loop. We got Theory of Fun, that says that learning the system is why we play. Learning how all the components in the system interacts, and what kind of input results in what kind of output. Note, the participants are also components and learning them is learning to predict the outcome in the whole gaming experience. We also got Nicole Lazzaro's hard fun, easy fun, serious fun, people fun - that mostly are feelings we get from the emergence that appear.<br/><br/>To design a game is to design for emergence, and by doing that you have to create a system where the participants are one part of the components in that system. Add to this what I've written earlier: "We need, during a session, to work as a group - to form a communication in how to play. To think as a group. To feel as a group. To co-operate in creating a story - or a sense of feeling - together."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420766/#Comment_420766" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-27T12:29:42+00:00" title="August 27, 2013 12:29PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like the system analogy, and I believe it represents well our hobby.<br/>I'd like to stress out something you have already mentioned : role playing games, unlike traditional games (boardgames, for instance) are <i>very complex</i> system.<br/>And the rules are only a small fraction of the "equation" : for how long have the players been playing together?

I didn't get freeform at the time - or "system-less", like it was also called. From this thread, we know now that there is no such thing as "system-less" because the group is forming a system of it's own. I didn't get freeform at all. No rules? How can you play with no rules? Roger Caillois attempted to categorize all games, and put his categories on a scale where paidia was at one end and ludus at the other. paidia is free imagining - doing whatever at the moment -  while ludus is hard-coded rules. Raph Koster tells us in Theory of Fun: 10 Years Later that we always draw from our experience to form a structure, and that paidia is nothing more than unspoken rules. So in the end: both ludus and paidia are rules: spoken or unspoken.<br/><br/>[edit 2] End statement: there is no such thing as improvisation. It only takes different structures than planning ahead.<br/><br/>During this last decade, I discovered structured freeform but what I realized is that it's just a collection of techniques put into structures for how to play the game, just as rules are. I later understood that freeform during the 90s is nothing more than structured freeform. I also realized that game mechanics are nothing more than structures for how to play.<br/><br/>There are two types of structures (possibly more): procedures and pools. Procedures are lists where you execute everything in order, and procedures can loop into themselves or release each other. Pools are instead lists of options that you can choose from, with a provided instruction of how to use the pool. <b>Apocalypse World</b> uses both, where you have a procedure to activate moves but you also have a pool of moves to choose from. If we were going to play something from a paidia point of view, it could be thought of as improvisation, but what you do is instead to draw from your pool of experience. There is no improvisation. There are only structures of play.<br/><br/>That's why I don't talk about game mechanics. It's just one tiny bit of the whole game.<br/><br/>[edit] <a href="#Comment_420991" rel="nofollow">More talk about pools and procedures</a>.\n<blockquote>We're not the only ones with such complex systems :</blockquote>\nYes, and this is one reason why I'm writing in this thread: to learn from other medias. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote>And the rules are only a small fraction of the "equation" : for how long have the players been playing together? Are there new players at the table?</blockquote>\nI said earlier that I want roleplaying games to build a relation, but I actually never thought about how these games assume that the group already has a healthy relation. It would be nice with rules that started with "The newest member in the group...", and then give that person a little extra status.\n<blockquote>Are role playing games such a complex systems that we should always provide unfinished product, such as <i>very open rules </i>and <i>storyboard</i>, knowing that we can't know all the elements of the "equation" of any game session?</blockquote>\nI've heard writers say that when their books reaches the reader, it's not their creation anymore, because the reader will interpret the words. Roleplaying games are no exceptions, but I've found only one - Hammarn och Trollsp\xf6t (Eng. The Hammer and the Wand) - that actually uses that to it's advantage. The description of the world and how to play the game differs widely depending on who's reading it. The writer have talked about it on a forum, but I noticed it myself when I read the adventure chapter. Depending on my own taken standpoint when reading, I could interpret three different adventure types (railroad, sandbox, and <a href="http://www.gnomestew.com/gming-advice/the-fish-tank-as-a-mystery-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_new">fish tank</a>) from the same text.<br/><br/>But you're right, we should probably provide open products. We are already doing it today, but it seems like many aren't aware of this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420782/#Comment_420782" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-27T14:55:04+00:00" title="August 27, 2013  2:55PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 27, 2013 2:57PM by vulpinoid.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nothing much to comment at this point for a contribution, i just wanted to say that this stuff is great.

It's been a while since I've read it and I admit to being too lazy right now to go look it up, take extensive notes, and then summarize for you (so take what I'm about to write with a grain of salt) BUT: Brook talks about different kinds of theater and there are three that I can remember.<br/><br/>The first is Deadly Theater. It is spectacle. That's it. Maybe there was an attempt at substance, but really it's just pretty costumes and pyrotechnics. It is theater that is just trying to impress.<br/><br/>The second is Holy Theater. This is theater that MEANS  something. It conveys a message to those watching, something that we can latch on to.<br/><br/>The third is Theater in the Rough. This is theater that eschews the spectacle of the Deadly; it's not about the props, it's about the story.<br/><br/>There are a lot of parallels here to role playing. How easy is it to fall into the trap of the Deadly - "hey, here's a scary monster ... wooooOOOoooo!" - I never like it when I do it. And I never like it when other GMs do it. It doesn't mean anything.<br/><br/>I love it when the game takes on a deeper meaning, when players need to make decisions that they care about. I do think there is something to be said about focusing on character, though. While I appreciate personal investment, it is still a game. I want my character to be invested, tied to the game. If that's what keeps me coming back, great.<br/><br/>The Theater in the Rough seems especially relevant to this thread, specifically to your interests. I remember Brook talking about alternative venues, about spontaneity. About cutting away the clutter to lay bare some other part of the story. When you talk about the mechanics being only a small part of role playing for you, that's what comes to mind.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420789/#Comment_420789" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-27T18:06:45+00:00" title="August 27, 2013  6:06PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here are some observations I have made:<br/>1) RPGs let you be creative.

It wasn't much that I could use, but I tagged a page that said the following.\n<blockquote>...if two people move across the [empty] space and one says to the other, "Hello! Mr. Livingstone, I presume", these words ar sufficient to conjure up Africa, palm trees, and so on. If, on the other hand, he had said "Hello ... where is the Metro?" the spectator would be a street in Paris.<br/><br/>/.../<br/><br/>If all you do is place two people side by side in an empty space, each detail comes into focus.</blockquote>\nI thought this was interesting, because I'm tired of framing scenes by describing the environment first. I rather describe it last or through a dialogue. Scene framing should instead be about WHAT you want from the scene. What kind of situation you want to happen, but not how it's going to be played out. Framing a scene could sound like this:<br/><br/>"I think it would be interesting if Ms Parker and her husband were to meet, after that incident with the husband and the servant. What do you think? [taking in opinions] OK, lets play it out." After that, the dialogue starts. If one player think it's important with where the scene takes place, that person can say "Doesn't the roses smell beautiful" or just leave the place to later, if it needs to be established at all.<br/><br/>We know:\n<ol><li>Who are present.</li>\n<li>What the intention is of the scene.</li></ol>We don't need to know more than that to play out a scene. Viola Spolin says something similar [edit] I was wrong. It's Jurij Alschitz, a guy who teaches the ideas of Konstantin Stanislavskij. (Some interesting ideas that I will perhaps come to later.)<br/><br/>You could play out a whole conversation without knowing the place, and sometimes it's refreshing to establish the location as a finishing touch. Ending with "Good night! *I turn off the bed light"" will create something entirely different than "Enough of this chatter. I think we dug deep enough. Lets dump these bodies and get out of here".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420818/#Comment_420818" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-28T08:44:47+00:00" title="August 28, 2013  8:44AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2013 3:34AM by Rickard.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Talking about Viola Spolin. I flickered through the pages of Theater Games for Rehearsal. I really like reading her stuff, because she calls the exercises for "games" and the actors for "players".\n<blockquote>The direction helps actors keep the focus which sets the game in motion, and all become fellow players as they attend to the same problem from different points of view.</blockquote>\nHer technique to rehearsal, and she was to my knowledge the first one to do it, was to do improv exercises and step in as a sidecoach to direct the players. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MViuNWN5Q7s&amp;list=PLC31934BE625E1033" rel="nofollow" target="_new">Here is an example of how it can sound</a> (but less humoristic).<br/><br/>It feels like Jeepform has taken a lot from her, because they are using techniques to sidecoach the players. <i>Bird in the Ear</i> is a technique where the game master whispers new information to one player - "She hates you", "You know the truth" or "Is this really the garden?" - to change the player's behaviors. This seems like classic sidecoaching - a game style that could be used a lot more to help the players to increase their spontaneity, creativity and communication. Spolin writes a list of things that the director should be thinking of during these exercises, and I believe it's something a game master should consider during a session.\n<ol><li>Am I giving enough energy?</li>\n<li>Am I staying overlong on mechanics?</li>\n<li>Which players need individual attention?</li>\n<li>Do they need more workshops?</li>\n<li>Are rehearsals to drawn out?</li>\n<li>Am I nagging the players?</li>\n<li>Am I attacking them?</li>\n<li>Are the actors working at odds with me?</li>\n<li>Is the problem physical or psychological?</li>\n<li>Am I just being a traffic manager?</li>\n<li>Is it necessary to stimulate more spontaneity?</li>\n<li>Am I overanxious?</li>\n<li>Am I asking them for more than they can give me at this time?</li>\n<li>Am I reaching the intuitive?</li></ol>\nI can recognize myself asking the first three in my game mastering today, but the fourth is something I want to include more. I'm already doing exercises today, at the beginning of the session, to show how I and the rest of the players should communicate when I'm the game master, but I would like to reflect during the coarse of the game if I need to hit the brakes and do exercises to relieve spontaneity and creativity even more. Nagging and attacking is something I've seen on conventions, where people who are fired up are attacking a shy or undetermined player with directed questions. I always aim to build a creative environment where everybody feels safe enough to contribute to "the story" or "the experience" of the game. To do that, you need to be compassionate and calm, but still feed the group with energy. Don't force yourself upon the others, but cherish what they do - either by telling them how good they are or by building on their ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420831/#Comment_420831" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-28T12:53:52+00:00" title="August 28, 2013 12:53PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 15, 2014 10:18AM by Rickard.">edited November 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you turn a switch, a lamp will be lit. That's feedback - a positive reinforcement. We can control the players' behaviors by any kind of reinforcements. In video games, there are a lot of talk about rewards. Chris Bateman lists heaps of them over <a href="http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2005/08/designing_rewar.html" rel="nofollow" target="_new">at his blog</a>, and the interested can go over there to read. The reason why I don't list them here is because rewards are just a part of positive reinforcements, and rewards have a tendency to create a thinking pattern in the game designer's head that the only reinforcements are mechanical ones. That kind of thinking can harm your game.\n<blockquote>"Whenever you're in combat, gain 1 XP".<br/>"If you follow your belief, gain 1 artha."<br/>"If you make someone laugh, gain 1 die."</blockquote>\nWhat I'm partly talking about is the overjustifaction effect, where studies has shown that rewards only works if the task is <i>boring </i>in the first place, if the reinforcement is <i>verbal</i>, or if you're competing and <i>beating </i>other players. If the participants wants to do a task, and mechanical reward is given, then a reward for doing it will have either <i>no effect </i>or, in worst case scenario, <i>decrease</i> the fun of doing the task. A game should reinforce fun ways of playing the game, because frankly: who wants to do boring tasks in a game?<br/><br/>What I'm also talking about is that the reinforcement should have something to do with what being reinforced. If I tell a joke, then my character shouldn't become better at swords. If I tell a joke, other  participants should instead laugh. If I play out a seduction scene, I should see what consequences that will bring me. If I however roll to sneak pass the guards, then I should be rewarded XP (that affect game mechanics), because then I solve something by <i>using </i>the game mechanics. We should be better at communicating through reinforcements. Like I said in my previous post: "...cherish what they do - either by telling them how good they are or by building on their ideas." This is all part of the whole communication in a roleplaying game.<br/><br/>Don't throw in (mechanical) rewards and think that will solve everything. Instead, think of how to reinforce each other through communication.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420840/#Comment_420840" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-28T15:25:00+00:00" title="August 28, 2013  3:25PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Summarizing a few ideas I found really interesting:<br/><br/>-There's no such thing as a freeform, it's just that players are using procedures and pools from their experience instead of following a book.<br/>-Any RPG System actually includes:<br/><br/><b>a) Procedures for creating and establishing the fiction</b>, like prep, brainstorming, provoking questions, character creation, relationship trees, scene framing through description, through adding details in the players dialogue or by presenting visual material (drawings, maps and miniatures), roleplaying (as in Acting)<br/><br/><b>b) Procedures to negotiate the fiction</b>, like Techniques, mostly, though you could squeeze here rules and mechanics.<br/><br/><b>c) Pools for both a &amp; b</b><br/><br/>-a, b &amp; c synchro and feedback each other. when fiction is changed by the players, pools may increase, new things generate and even new techniques to deal with those elements may appear.<br/><br/>-There hasn't been any game that includes and explains all these on their corebook.

People will either ignore or fill based on previous experiences. This is common. If I don't have, as an example, a combat system, people will start wonder where it is. If I start talking about when to roll dice, some readers will ignore it because they have been playing roleplaying games in ten years and surely knows how and when to roll dice. I blame this behavior on two things:\n<ol><li>People are used to do this.</li>\n<li>We are writing roleplaying games in the wrong way - a way that are feeding the first point.</li></ol>\nYou can't change the first, but you can change the second one. We are to focused on HOW to do something instead of WHY we're doing it. I'm not sure that we should tell why either. Not in clear text, but instead the reader should realize this by reading the whole structure of the game. Perhaps we should focus more on WHAT the game wants from us. Boardgames makes this clear to us. Very clear\xb2\xb2\xb2. Most games today even put the end condition first in the manual, so we know why we are reading the rest of the book, and can make an understanding on WHY the rules exist while reading them.<br/><br/>In roleplaying games, when we read about character generation and combat, the game assumes that we know why. Of course, because they are in every traditional roleplaying game. But we don't reflect on why we need them. We just assume that we do. You can probably come up with a reason to why we need them, but that's just assuming. If I told you that we don't need character generation, but instead can make characters while playing to show what that particular session is about, you would probably wonder what the game is about. We don't need a combat system - we just assume that this is one of the types on conflicts that roleplaying games can have. We assume that roleplaying games needs conflicts. That is wrong. What we need is uncertainty\xb3\xb3\xb3, and conflicts are only but part of that.<br/><br/>Thoughts like this is what I mean when I write that I want to go back to the roots. To see on WHAT we need, and HOW we can, describe WHY we should play that game.<br/><br/>\xb2\xb2\xb2 I said in a previous thread that "how to make a scenario" should be first in a roleplaying book, but I think the whole book should be formed as a structure of play. The first thing we need to be first is to be told what kind of experience the game will create.

This is what I mean when I write "communication". I read The Game some years back, that controversial book that sees pulling as a game of manipulation. No matter what you think about that book, it brings up a good point. Verbal communication is nothing more than a pool of procedures. If you and me meet for the first time, we got a procedure for how to introduce ourselves. That procedure then reliefs another procedure that seeks, in a pool of topics, something to talk about. Worst case scenario, we will talk about the weather. The purpose of a conversation is to find topics that we both know and care about. I never ask someone what they do for a living because I care. I ask to find interesting things to talk about with that person.<br/><br/>I always find it easy to hang out on gaming convention, because we already have a common interest: gaming. During parties, I noticed that people sooner or later starts talking about sex. Even if you're a virgin, you still got some sort of idea about sex. We got the same thing when playing roleplaying games. No, I'm not talking about sex, but at any time, when you grab a roleplaying book, we know how to communicate in that game. We know the game's structure, it's pool of procedures, and it's specific procedure for each specific situation. Because we learned it, just like we learned how to do a conversation.<br/><br/>It's not that easy though. We also got people not knowing the game, we got a hierarchy within the group, either created socially from before or created by the game ("You're the game master"). These kinds of relations in the group can contradict each other, and plays an underlaying part in the communication. This is something I think roleplaying games should be better at building up. In <b>Kagematsu</b>, the game takes the typical minority in the roleplaying world - a woman - and places her in the game master seat. In LARP, we got mentors tutoring beginners so they don't have to feel footed. Theater exercises are playing and challenges different status to make the actors more aware of their existence.<br/><br/>What I really like in the quote above, and that I never would have thought of saying,  is: "...when fiction is changed by the players, pools may increase, new things generate and even new techniques to deal with those elements may appear." This happens in a conversation as well. Topics mutate into something. Most of the times, the topics aren't discussed to the end before they mutate, but that's good. That keeps up an interest! An <i>uncertainty</i> of what to come. I would like to see a roleplaying game that mutates like a conversation. What began with a love affair mutated into a duel and then sex ... or talking about the weather. This - these three procedures relieving each other - is something that should grow organically, and with the right procedures and pools, they can.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420915/#Comment_420915" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-30T16:12:41+00:00" title="August 30, 2013  4:12PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Exactly Rickard, that's another thing that makes RPGs so easy to learn: everyone used to the change of procedures and pools in conversations are already familiar with the flow of any game conversation. Also, everyone is accustomed to negotiate with people in the real world, so when you learn the equivalent tools the game uses for this (the techniques) you get confident in no time with them. Along with the understanding of roleplaying as a mix of play-pretend and theather, the learning curve ends up being surprisingly easier than you thought. Again, this makes me think that the techniques are still the only important barrier to learn how to play RPGs, and a key process that must see further development if we want to see the hobby evolve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420929/#Comment_420929" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-31T14:25:45+00:00" title="August 31, 2013  2:25PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2014 10:44AM by Rickard.">edited September 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark Rosewater is a lead designer of Magic the Gathering, and one thing he contributed with was the player types Timmy, Johnny and Spike. These three, and some were added later on, were in the designer's head when developing cards. Timmy wanted big monsters, Spike wanted to win and Johnny wanted to express himself through the deck. When you design a game, you should tell the participant WHAT the game is about, but this doesn't have to do anything with why a each individual wants to play roleplaying games.<br/><br/>Roger Caillois has his categories of games: (taken from Wikipedia)\n<blockquote> <i>Agon</i>, or competition. E.g. Chess<br/> <i>Alea</i>, or chance. E.g. Playing a slot machine<br/> <i>Mimicry</i>, or mimesis, or role playing. E.g. Playing a MMORPG<br/> <i>Ilinx </i>(Greek for "whirlpool"), or vertigo, in the sense of altering perception. E.g. taking hallucinogens, riding roller coasters, children spinning until they fall down.</blockquote>\nNicole Lazzaro have her four ways of fun.\n<blockquote><i>Hard fun</i> is competition or challenging yourself.<br/><i>Easy fun</i> is discovering and sensation.<br/><i>Serious fun</i> is finding a meaning that you care about.<br/><i>People fun</i> is about sharing a moment with your friends. </blockquote>\nMarc LeBlanc lists eight kinds of fun (aesthetics): (taken from his homepage)\n<blockquote><i>Sensation</i>: game as sense-pleasure<br/><i>Fantasy</i>: game as make-believe<br/><i>Narrative</i>: game as unfolding story<br/><i>Challenge</i>: game as obstacle course \t  \t<br/><i>Fellowship</i>: game as social framework<br/><i>Discovery</i>: game as uncharted territory<br/><i>Expression</i>: game as soap box<br/><i>Submission</i>: game as mindless pastime</blockquote>\nIn computer games, people love to talk about Bartley's four player types:\n<blockquote> <i>Killers</i>: interfere with the functioning of the game world or the play experience of other players<br/> <i>Achievers</i>: accumulate status tokens by beating the rules-based challenges of the game world<br/> <i>Explorers</i>: discover the systems governing the operation of the game world<br/> <i>Socializers</i>: form relationships with other players by telling stories within the game world</blockquote>\nBartley's list above is taken from <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/134842/personality_and_play_styles_a_.php?print=1" rel="nofollow" target="_new">Personality And Play Styles: A Unified Model</a> by Bart Stewart, where he also includes the GNS. Check out the article, because he claims that GNS is missing one player type. What's interesting is that even if there are tons of categorization out there, they are pretty much saying the same thing but with different words. We can for example find a Spike in every categorization here above.<br/><br/>From my own analyze of these categories, I can find "four" reasons to be engaged:<br/><b>Competition</b>: to try to beat the game or the other participants in different aspects of the game.<br/><b>Exploration</b>: to explore different aspects of the game.<br/><b>Expression</b>: to express yourself in different ways <i>through</i> the game.<br/><b>Sensation</b>: to experience something, to get an insight, to feel, to escape from reality.<br/><br/>I've been talking about WHAT the game is about earlier, but that has nothing to do with WHY a participant engage in a game. You can design the game with this in mind, like in Magic and a lot of video games, but I wonder if you ever can control why people are playing. The only thing you can be aware of is why some people wont play your game while others will adore it. Another thing I wonder is if we doesn't have all these reasons of playing a game all the time, but in different grades depending on mood, company and what kind of game that are about to be played. The experience of the game is also important to consider, where sensation can be a lot stronger in the beginning.<br/><br/>Some will perhaps wonder how I can narrow down LeBlanc's eight ways of fun into four reasons to be engaged, while I at the same time totally ignore Bartley's socializers and Lazzaro's people fun. Well, I will come to that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420930/#Comment_420930" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-31T15:16:57+00:00" title="August 31, 2013  3:16PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 1, 2013 10:48AM by Rickard.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've talked earlier about how how you should design for emergence, and that you can do that by letting several components in a system interact with each other. The people in the group are one part of the system, but hat else do we have? I will draw inspiration from LeBlanc's MDA - Narrative, Fellowship - and Lazarro - serious fun is finding a meaning that you care about. We got the Big Models premise that's saying the same thing as serious fun. Drawing from my own experience of gaming, I can find the following five groups of components in a game.<br/><br/><b>Meaning</b>: philosophical, ethical, spiritual and social questions.<br/><b>Structures</b>: pools and procedures. A way of communicating within the game.<br/><b>Group</b>: the participants and their relations within the group.<br/><b>Fiction</b>: the story being told.<br/><b>Setting</b>: the place where the story is being told and the people occupying it.<br/><br/>I'm not saying a game have to include all these things, but instead use a combination of these groups of components. Add the four reasons to be engaged to this, and you can see that you can <i>explore </i>the structure of the game (In <b>Dogs in the Vineyard</b>, the characters will become assholes). You can <i>explore </i>the meaning of a question (What love is worth in <b>Kagematsu</b>). You can get a <i>sensation </i>when doing that. You can <i>compete </i>in succeeding in the fiction ("my character's goal was a success"). You can <i>express </i>yourself through the group, or express yourself through the setting of the game (Controlling domains in <b>Archipelago</b>). Note that I'm talking about the emergence of the game here - the result of what the system produces. To express yourself through the setting of the game in Archipelago is actually controlled by a structure. Answering a meaning in Kagematsu is a combination of setting and structure. Mixing reasons to engage and components of the game is telling you WHY we should play the game. To achieve that, you have to make the components interact. Tell us then WHAT the game is about (winning condition or goal) and finally make us realize WHY to play the game through reading the game's structure.<br/><br/>[edit] I'm worried that this above can be hard to understand. I felt myself that I lost what I was going to write about (components to create emergence) while writing the post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420948/#Comment_420948" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-01T10:21:29+00:00" title="September  1, 2013 10:21AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 1, 2013 10:56AM by Rickard.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remember moments from when I was active in soccer. Games where it didn't matter what I did, I always succeeded. Sometimes even the whole team shared this state and we could turn games around from loosing to winning. I have found out that this feeling is called "flow". Flow is described by Mih\xe1ly Cs\xedkszentmih\xe1lyi as being fully immersed and focused on a task. While being in the flow, time and space will disappear and you will become one with the task. A rewarding spontaneous joy will emerge while doing it. The following is taken from Wikipedia:<br/><br/><div>Flow theory postulates three conditions that have to be met to achieve a flow state:\n<ul><li>One must be involved in an activity with a clear set of goals and progress. This adds direction and structure to the task.</li>\n<li>The task at hand must have clear and immediate feedback. This helps the person negotiate any changing demands and allows him or her to adjust his or her performance to maintain the flow state.</li>\n<li>One must have a good balance between the perceived challenges of the task at hand and his or her own perceived skills. One must have confidence that he or she is capable to do the task at hand.</li></ul></div><br/>If I were to translate this to roleplaying games:\n<ol><li>All participants around the table must be aware of what's going on. The game must be clear with delivering it's purpose - what the game is about. All players (not "characters") can have their own directions of where they want the game to go, but these must also be known by everybody. Every scene that's framed must be framed with an intention - a direction of where it should go. That doesn't mean people should know how the scene should go there. The purpose and the intention are something that the game's structure should provide.</li>\n<li>The game's structure should also provide constant reinforcements, either by the game itself or by the participants. Cheering for people, building on their ideas, offering new ideas, tying connections within the group, creating consequences, and mechanical rewards for solving things with game mechanics. We can do this by increasing each others' awareness for each other. To teach how to think to reinforce in a fruitful way.</li>\n<li>We must learn to break free from our self-censoring and become original. To become more relaxed in taking space. To be more sensible of others so we can provide more natural reactions. We must be sure of what structures to be used. If you find the structures to hard to understand, the flow will be broken. When everything seems to fix itself, you're instead taken by it. But you must also have some sort of challenge - something that creates some sort of uncertainty or effort. I have no trouble "improvising" a story (there is no such thing as improvising), so that will never put me in the flow, but if you and me were to create a story together, that challenge can create a flow state for both of us.</li></ol>\nTo be in the flow in roleplaying games is so much more than just being immersed in your character. You can also immerse in the <i>fiction</i>, in the game's <i>structures </i>(for tactical games), in building relations within the <i>group</i>, loose yourself in the <i>setting</i> (which the character is a part of), or being taken by the <i>meaning </i>of the game. In a best case scenario, the whole group will be in the flow. That's when the best experiences happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420949/#Comment_420949" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-01T11:21:04+00:00" title="September  1, 2013 11:21AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            About your "pools" and "procedures" : I'm a business architect as a living, and the two common terms we use are "process" and "procedures".<br/>When talking about a <i>trade</i> (I'm using this term on purpose), an architect with try to come up with a list of processes. <br/><br/>For instance, in a bank you would have : "creating/editing a customer", "creating/editing an account", "putting money in the account", "withdrawing money from the account", "closing an account" ... and so forth. When "re designing" <i>systems</i> (I'm choosing this term on purpose), we list all the processes, map them relatively to each other (we also use a list of <i>roles</i> and indicate which role uses which process). A good architect is the one who can remove a process from the system (for various reasons, be it redundant with another process and because it is a process that has no value).<br/>Once this is done, the architect/analyst then describe each process into procedures (to see exactly how it is "executed").<br/><br/>Now, can a map/list of processes for rpg (with the roles involved) can be done? I don't see why it couldn't ...<br/>That said, I think the use of "processes" and "procedures" might be easier than "pools" and "procedures" since they are less specific in their usage.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Another thing that came to me while reading this [long] thread :<br/>I've mentioned earlier that I've met a dancer who used to play rpg a long ago and that she still uses "techniques" from rpg in her present line of work.<br/>What is she using? Scene framing.<br/><br/>Now, the thing is, scene framing is present in rpg, but not only in rpg. Playing rpg is a great way to <i>learn</i> about it, see how it works (better than seeing a movie, for instance).<br/>This reminds me somehow, of Habermas and his notion that there is truth in art (as much as in science), but a very personal truth, different from one person to the other.<br/><br/>I've seen "commercial", who played rpg and still uses skills related to "negotiating".<br/>I've done recently something used in marketing, called "persona", where you represent your customers as "character/archetype" using something that really, but really looks like a character sheet. I did find this activity very, very easy ...<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>We could build a list of process that are present in rpg, and the realized that most of them are not restricted to our hobby, and can be used elsewhere.

I love links. ^^ If I understand correctly, "processes" aren't what I mean with "pools". Processes are what is done and by whom, and procedures, according to one of the links, is HOW things are done.<br/><br/>When I say "pool", I mean a collection of stuff to choose from. A pool could be something like this: "When you describe an environment, you must include one of the following words: bone, despair, naked, empty, rain, scent". A pool can also be <i>a collection of</i> procedures, just as a procedure can include different pools <i>to be executed in order</i>.<br/><br/>Both are lists. A procedure is a list where everything is executed in order. A pool is a list of options that you can choose from, and an instruction of how to use the pool. Both provides a structure for the game. You can find procedures and pools at all levels in the game's structure. From an overall explanation of to play the game down to very specific circumstances while playing.<br/><br/>[edit] Quite correctly, processes aren't procedures, but procedures are part of a process. When talking about pools and procedures, I was only half-right. What I should talk about is a process.

And this is very important (many analysts neglect that part). For a <i>given system/trade</i>, there is a <i>list of processes</i>. When a certain situation arises, an "actor" (in the sense of someone having a role in a given system) check the list of processes, choose the one that seems the more appropriate, and then might (or not), execute a procedure.<br/>There is that notion of "checking into the list" and picking the right process ...<br/><br/>Speaking of WHY, when analyzing a "system", there is an exchange with the "actors", asking WHAT they do and WHY they do it.<br/>It's surprising, but there are really two common answers to this :<br/>- "because I've <i>always</i> done it"<br/>- "because I was <i>instructed</i> to do it"<br/>And those are tough situations with the actors, because they clearly have never questioned the purpose of what they were doing.<br/>Now, that is the first step of analyzing a system. The HOW (and WHO) comes late after.<br/><br/>Another resemblance :<br/>- WHAT and WHY is <i>strategic</i>.<br/>- HOW and WHO is <i>tactic</i>.<br/><br/>So, I guess you're really looking at the rpg from a strategic point of view. <br/>Or maybe, you're [also] doing a business analysis of rpg as a system (remember your earlier posts?).

I will look into the video later though. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421028/#Comment_421028" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-03T11:00:23+00:00" title="September  3, 2013 11:00AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something here and on other threads made me wonder how much of my personal experience I have thrown into GMing and I suddenly realized that for years I've been using my knowledge of advertising to make illusionism work! I still use this a lot even when I'm no longer railroading. How is advertising usefull at this? Well, I basically use <a href="http://www.buzzle.com/articles/types-of-advertising-appeals.html" rel="nofollow">different types of advertising appeals</a> when I'm framing scenes, so they work in almost a subliminal way. Of course, probably most of us use this anyway, but if you're having trouble trying to give cues to your players to try something or if they keep paying attention to elements that distract them from the mood you're trying to convey or keep, perhaps you're not using them enough.<br/><br/>For example I recall something as simple as describing how players come into another town and find there's a huge convention of heroes there... and they all see a big group of people all going all excited to the same place. This is part something called Bandwagon and part use of emotional words. What happened? Of course, players start to wonder about this and asked questions about it. Once this becomes the topic, it feels more like they are leading the way, instead of me plainly railroading.<br/><br/>Boy, perhaps is due to techniques like these that there are players that defend railroading as a valid technique; my players have never complain when I've used this, and even found my GMing skills a bit lacking when I tried to go more for an open sandbox. Perhaps the last reaction was because they got used, more than because it's a really good practice, but there you have another explaining for this mystery.                        </div>\n<div

You've drawn from your pool of experience, and using structures [techniques from advertising] that your players have become aware of. The players recognizing [a structure] gives them self-courage to bring something of their own to the mix. Assuming they like what's being talked about in the first place.<br/><br/>If I were to tell you to make palt - a dish typical for Sweden - you will probably hesitate. If I said it was dumplings made out of potato and flour, you would draw from your own experience in how to make dumplings. If you instead knew how to make palt, and like to make food, you could get enough self-courage to even suggest changes to the recipe. Perhaps using bacon instead of salted pork, or combinations (from your pool of experience) that I couldn't even dream of. That's also how a typical conversation work (in a simplified way).<br/><br/>A healthy group has it's own (often unspoken - paidia) ways of communicating. A game should provide a way of communication in the same matter (but in form of ludus), and it can even add things to, or make the group aware of, the group's social hierarchy. All to make the communication more fruitful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421048/#Comment_421048" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-03T16:12:16+00:00" title="September  3, 2013  4:12PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, in my case it was more like yes, I had drawn techniques from my own experience, but they were so subtle that players didin't pick'em up conciously. In fact, they were so subtle I didn't realized I was using them until now. I'm aware that each group has it's own ways of comunicating, their own spoken and non-spoken language. <br/><br/>Yet we all humans share some sort of common background in our most basic forms of comunication. Gestures that allow us to share emotions. Our nature still makes us negotiate and put an effort on interpretation, for most of the time misunderstandings makes us miss a lot of opportunities in life. I still think that these are assets that can be exploited to make RPGs easier to learn, more eficient at helping people reach the gameflow and leave space for the games to grow in other senses.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421505/#Comment_421505" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-14T12:47:43+00:00" title="September 14, 2013 12:47PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 9, 2014 7:36PM by Rickard.">edited September 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We all know how to communicate. It's something we learn as we're growing up. A story told by a ten year old is sometimes hard to follow, because the lack of consistency. A fifteen year old telling the same story would be more consistent and therefore easier to follow. We learn how to listen, and when to cut in. We also learn when enough is enough, and that you should after a while let someone else take the lead. We learn to build from each other. One thing I find interesting is that one or two people are always leading the conversation. It's not always the same persons, as the topic mutates into something else. We take on the lead when we got something to say, or something to add to what someone else just said.<br/><br/>This is something I think we should use better in roleplaying games. At the moment, we dressed The Lead in game mechanics. We got "speaking points", initiative systems, limited use of powers, the game master taking care of describing the environment, and much more. I would rather see one or two people narrating, and letting others cut in when they got something to say. If we see our game as a conversations - a moment of exchanging ideas - things would sort itself out. I'm not saying that we should build a storytelling game with one narrator relieving another. We can still play like we always have, but with an awareness of each other. An awareness built by taking the unspoken rules (paidia) of a conversation and bring it out to the light, revealing them to everyone.<br/><br/>When talking about roleplaying games, 95 % of all examples are about combat, so I shall do an example about that. How should a combat be handled if we created an initiative system based on a conversation? How should people respond? Who should respond on what? Obviously, the person who has something to say should be the one who should talk, and all the time be aware of other people wanting to cut in. We can still have a game master responding to what the first person said, to create new situations. Situations that other people can cut in and build on. We can still have some sort of game mechanic to lean on, but it shouldn't cut off the talking (no failed rolls) or decide who gets to talk. Instead, the rules should give incitements of where the game wants to go. About what the game is about. To take into account the theme "crying", "space ships" will create a totally different combat compared to the themes "blood", "unforgiving".<br/><br/>What is the combat about, and how can it escalate <i>into something else</i>? Like I said before, topics in conversations mutates in a natural way. So should conflicts in roleplaying games too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421507/#Comment_421507" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-14T14:42:59+00:00" title="September 14, 2013  2:42PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>We all know how to communicate.

Sometimes, she asks questions and the people around just answer "funny stuff", impossible stories. We never tell her it is false and sometime, a couple of days/weeks later, she comes back saying "he, that other night, you were fooling me!! It's not true!! I've told some co-coworkers at they laugh at me". So, she's getting more suspicious with time ...<br/><br/>So, some evenings, when we're having diner with some friends, there are some moments when we know we can tell my wife a <i>story</i>. A <i>fantastic fable</i> to answer one of a her question. And it is really a story, all made up. And since she gets suspicious, she asks around the table, so we have to build a story <i>together</i>. There are of course, no rules, but there's this dynamic between us ... and it's not improv either. It is something everyone knows how to do ... And there is some kind of pure pleasure in it.

That's bad! (Hello, Chess! Good bye, D&amp;D!) It's good, however, to blur the outcome for a participant. What I mean by that is that others can give input to change the outcome. To cut in and build on another person's narration. You can also create an emergent complexity, where the outcome is hard to predict due to the many possibilities that the system gives. Remember, system in this case consist of several components, where game structures and participants are only two.<br/><br/>You can also create uncertainty by having hidden resources. In <b>Lady Blackbird</b>, each role got a secret to be used once over the session. In <b>Det sj\xe4tte inseglet</b>, all participants write secret truths about the setting that will be revealed while playing. Thomas M Malaby and Marc LeBlanc has given us a list of different kinds of uncertainties:<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MALABY</span><br/><i>Beyond Play: A New Approach to Games</i><br/><br/><b>Stochastic Contingency</b>: stochastic is just a fancy word for "random".\n<blockquote>[see Randomness below]</blockquote>\n<b>Social Contingency</b>: about never being certain of another person's point of view.<blockquote>having someone other than you in charge of saying what happens...<br/>...a strong GM role with great control over the world / plotline...<br/>one participant's interpretation, perhaps having a rule system with open-deterministic results or using cards that are open for interpretation.<br/>enforcing of people's opinions, like voting for outcomes or making pacts.<br/>using different techniques or rules during a scene, which may steer the story in a certain direction. "What? Is someone going to fall in love?"</blockquote>\n<b>Performative Contingency</b>: you either succeed or fail at a task.<blockquote>one participant's effort in succeeding. (performance uncertainty)<br/>two or more participants against each other.</blockquote>\n<b>Semiotic Contingency</b>: the outcome is open for interpretation, changing the meaning of all the previously actions.\n<blockquote>The good person was the bad person all along.<br/>The game Train, where you discover the theme of the game while playing.<br/></blockquote>\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;">LEBLANC</span><br/><i><a href="http://gamecenter.nyu.edu/2009/10/nyu-game-center-lecture-series-marc-leblanc" rel="nofollow">Lecture at NYU</a></i><br/><br/><b>Incomplete Information</b>: if you don't have all the pieces, you don't know where it's going.<blockquote>...players pick elements of the story that other players must include in other characters' storylines.<br/>...picking a different oracle and elements for each session inspires the players to create an interesting history full of twists<br/>...hidden or undefined knowledge about something the players /.../ care about.<br/>...exploration and mapping...<br/>I would see Exploration and Mystery as two genres / elements that use curiosity at their core.<br/>...Hexploration genre, where you can travel to each place in a sandboxy way...<br/>one participant adding something that isn't obvious what it's for.</blockquote>\n<b>Randomness</b>: the general solution in roleplaying games.<blockquote>conflict resolution /.../ task resolution<br/>...a random table or a deck of event cards or a stack of map tiles.<br/>the use of real world happenings, like having the weather or certain events in the newspaper affect the session.</blockquote>\n<b>Emergent Complexity</b>: the interaction between the pieces of information or the overflow of information makes it hard to predict the outcome.<blockquote>parallel stories with one ending.

Like the three rounds in Jeopardy.<blockquote>I think that the games people really like have good conflict escalation mechanisms (either formal mechanisms like in AW or Polaris or in terms of initial set-up like in Poison'd.)<br/>...strong characterownership where you can keep and reveal a secret about a character under your control.</blockquote>\n<b>Potential Barrier (Decelerator)</b>: you don't know if you will overcome them.

In the Chinese and Japanese narrative form kish\u014dtenketsu, you will never know what will come. When used in a poem, the first two lines establish and develop, the third introduces a new element, and the fourth line ties everything together. Keith Johnstone is talking about reincorporation in his book Impro. It's easy to create a story by constantly adding new elements, like the first three sentences in kish\u014dtenketsu. But constantly adding new elements to the story will mean it's hard to know if the story is coming to it's end. It can end in the first sentence, in the third sentence or in the fourtysixth sentence. That's when the fourth sentence in kish\u014dtenketsu comes in, and reincorporate the first ones with the third. Now the audience knows the story will come to an end. Both Dan Harmon's Story Circle and the Campbell's Monomyth ends with reincorporation. The Story Circle even keeps on reincorporating from the second half of the story. Comedians reincorporate too when they are performing an act.<br/><br/>Johnstone is also talking about routines. To shop groceries is a routine. To drive to the store is a routine. To keep up an interest, break the routines before they come to an end. "You're driving to the store when suddenly ..." or "You're pushing the trolley before you while looking for tomatoes when something comes over you that haven't happened in years.". This is somewhat I'm talking  about when conversations mutate; when they change before they will come to an end. You can do this, not only with situations, but also with narrating techniques. Focusing on one character walking, changing the view to another person's footsteps, describing emotions, the wind is playing with a plastic bag, and how a body is falling onto the bag. Do you see what I did there? I broke routines and then reincorporated elements to end my story. I created uncertainty by breaking routines and then ended with something familiar by reincorporation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422159/#Comment_422159" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-29T07:10:26+00:00" title="September 29, 2013  7:10AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 29, 2013 7:43AM by Rickard.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<h3>Summary</h3>The purpose of this thread is to relearn our hobby by seeing the similarities from other mediums and take knowledge from that. In the same matter, we need to spot what we nowadays implies through our design (ex. "A game master should balance the game to make the players finally succeed") and keep on remember people about those things.  Rules of Play, by Salen and Zimmerman, talks about constitutive rules, meaning two games that may look different share the same structures of play. For example, Puerto Rico and Race for the Galaxy. The following below are some similarities from other mediums that roleplaying games share.<br/><br/>- Every participant is part of a closed system.<br/>- In a perfect world, all participants wants to contribute to the interaction that takes place in the system. You can achieve this by making each participant comfortable in the situation. To make each person feel unique. To make each person feel like they are being listened to. To create spontaneous and creative participants. To make them be flexible to the situation and also free to express themselves and their emotions.<br/>-  When interaction happens in a system, a result will emerge.<br/>- The interaction is nothing more than communication. When the participants talk or discuss, it's as much communication as if they are using the game mechanics.<br/>- Communication mutate in a natural way in order to keep it interesting.<br/><br/>- A system consist of several, but not necessary all, of the following components: meaning, fiction, setting, group and structures.<br/>- The communication, the interaction, between them are part of these structures (mechanics and techniques).<br/>- Structures comes in pools and procedures, often mixed in each other.<br/><br/>- A system should make the reader understand it's purpose (WHY).<br/>- A system should be clear of what components to be used.<br/>- A system should teach how to use these components. This often means creating a positive group relationship where everybody feels comfortable.<br/>- A system should have uncertainty.<br/>- A system should reincorporate.<br/>- A system should provide feedback. To reinforce. Examples may be: feeling good while doing a task, getting praise from others, or the result of the interaction (emergence).<br/><br/>- A game is a learning process.<br/><br/>I will add a thought to all this, and I got it from reading <a href="http://cogweb.ucla.edu/crp/Papers/Steen_Owens_2001.html" rel="nofollow">An Adaptationist Model of Pretense and Entertainment</a>: boredom is the default state, and we fight this by taking part in an activity.

I feel that that's not the whole truth. If we look at flow again, it states: "One must have a good balance between the perceived challenges of the task at hand and his or her own perceived skills." This means that if the task is to simple, it becomes boring. If task is too hard, it creates anxiety. In Bernard Suits' attempt to define a game, he propose that games are inefficient, meaning that you need obstacles on the way, to make the game interesting. You may think about physical objects, but rules creates obstacles through their limitations. To score a goal in soccer, you're limited not only by the opponents but also by the rules of the game. You can't pick up the ball with you hands, and you can only move within the play field. Following these rules, play will emerge.<br/><br/>Following the rules ... takes effort.<br/><br/>Effort comes in many forms. The easiest way is to divide different kinds of effort into physical, mental and social. Effort isn't about succeeding or not, because that's part of uncertainty. Effort is about participating. When you're done, you're done and we can move on to the next part of the game. You don't create obstacles for the players so they will fail, as little as a creator of a crossword would make it impossible to solve. When designing the rules, you could do it with different kinds of effort in mind. I will take the theory of multiple intelligences as suggestions of how to think when designing efforts:\n<blockquote><b>Musical/rhythmic &amp; harmonic:</b> sounds, rhythms, tones, and music.<br/><b>Visual:</b> either noticing or visualize the environment, forms and movement.<br/><b>Verbal/linguistic:</b>  reading, writing, telling stories and memorizing words along with date.<br/><b>Logical/mathematical:</b> logic, abstractions, reasoning, numbers and critical thinking.<br/><b>Bodily/kinesthetic:</b> bodily motions, the capacity to handle objects skillfully, a sense of timing, a clear sense of the goal of a physical action, along with the ability to train responses.<br/><b>Interpersonal:</b> interaction with other people.<br/><b>Intrapersonal:</b> having a deep understanding of the self; what your strengths/ weaknesses are, what makes you unique, being able to predict your own reactions/emotions. <br/><b>Naturalistic:</b> nurturing and relating information in nature.<br/><b>Existential:</b> understand spiritual or religious traditions.</blockquote>All these categories can be divided into smaller categories. Puzzles and riddles are not exactly the same as calculating probabilities, but they all belong to logical intelligence. Me using the multiple intelligences is just a suggestion. You can pick other sources. Inductive and deductive reasoning, sports, Edward de Bono's six thinking hats, and much more.<br/><br/>[edit] Effort is about participating, and while it's good to think about in what way a person may participate, it's also important to think about how to make a person participate. All the things I've written about creating a positive group feeling, where everybody feels that they want to contribute, is to lay the grounds for effort.<br/><br/>[edit 2] Above I've talked about different aspects of participation, but I would like to add that talking about effort is also about how to make someone wanting to participate. I wrote about how this in my very first post in this thread, quoted below\n<blockquote>Eleanor Chase  York says in <i>Children's Theatre and Creative Dramatics</i> that children [exposed to creative drama] becomes more<br/><b>creative</b>, by suppressing the school's one-sided reinforcement of the intellectual capacity, which makes the creativity suffer.<br/><b>sensible</b>, by teaching the children to react in a more aware and natural way on the things they perceive. /.../<br/><b>flexible</b>, by training the ability to adopt to changed situations (to suppress a rigid state of mind).<br/><b>original</b>, by believing in their ideas and have the courage to tell them.<br/><b>emotional stable</b>, by an constructive outlet of feelings and tensions.<br/><b>co-operable</b> and <b>group orientated</b>.<br/>/.../<br/>I'm not saying that we should play roleplaying games to become these points, as Eleanor Chase above, but roleplaying games <i>are</i> about these points. We must learn to break free from our self-censoring and become <i>original</i>. Play Unsafe (which took it from Improv) tells us that our ideas may seem unoriginal to us, but that doesn't mean that they are for the others. Your ideas will feel unique for me. And those ideas should be celebrated as much as you should be recognized as an original human being.<br/><br/>We need, during a session, to work as a group - to form a communication in how to play. To think as a group. To feel as a group. To co-operate in creating a story - or a sense of feeling - together.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422235/#Comment_422235" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-01T04:39:46+00:00" title="October  1, 2013  4:39AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 2, 2013 5:05AM by Rickard.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I said that interaction is communication, but interaction is twofold. You can usually choose what structure to use when communicating. Greg Costikyan goes as far in I Have No Words And I Must Design to say that <i>interactivity</i> is nothing more than decision-making. That games are about making decisions, and without them you got a linear activity.<br/><br/>Ian Schreiber lists different kinds of decisions over <a href="http://gamedesignconcepts.wordpress.com/2009/07/20/level-7-decision-making-and-flow-theory/" rel="nofollow">at his blog</a>.<br/><br/><b>Decision-making done wrong</b><br/><i>Obvious decisions.</i> There is clearly one right answer, so it\u2019s not really much of a choice. Getting a +2 to include an aspect while making an action is an obvious decision.<br/><i>Meaningless decisions.</i> The choice has no effect on gameplay. Attacking orc <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> or <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, where both have the same stats, is a meaningless decision.<br/><i>Blind decisions. </i> Without knowing the outcome of the decision, the result will be random. Choosing to go left or right in an intersection without knowing where any way will lead is a blind decision.<br/><br/><b>Decision-making done right</b><br/><i>Tradeoffs. </i> Weighing one resource against another. Trading with other players, auctions, purchases of equipment and much more. This could turn out to be obvious decisions, where if the sword is always better than the axe.<br/><i>Dilemmas. </i> Similar to tradeoff but where all choices will harm the player.<br/><i>Risk vs reward. </i> One choice is safe. The other choice has a potentially greater payoff, but also a higher risk of failure.<br/><i>Choice of actions. </i>You have several potential things you can do, but you can\u2019t do them all.<br/><i>Short term versus long term.</i> The player must balance immediate needs against long-term goals.<br/><i>Social information.</i> In games where bluffing, deal-making and backstabbing are allowed, players must choose between playing honestly or dishonestly<br/><i>Responses. </i> How should you respond to certain actions? Duck? Attack? Create a trap? Find an ally?<br/><i>Emotional. </i> Decisions that have an emotional impact on the player. It can be something in-game or meta, like how you always playing the dog in Monopoly. The latter is a pretty meaningless decision for the game, but not for the player.<br/><br/>Note that using stochastic elements, such as dice, decreases the weight of a choice. Sometimes so much that the choice itself is turned obsolete.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422288/#Comment_422288" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-02T05:00:47+00:00" title="October  2, 2013  5:00AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 2, 2013 6:26AM by Rickard.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It may look like that I dislike using dice, but that's not true. I like craps just like the other, but rolling one dice after another isn't fun in itself. Something is missing. Investment - something to put at stake. Something to care about. If you're playing a in Poker tournament and the winner will get a prize, that will perhaps motivate you. On the other hand, if you pay an entry fee, you've made an investment and your motivation will increase. Here is a list of different investments:<br/><br/><b>The character's inner and outer sphere</b>, such as ...<br/>... self respect.<br/>... drives. Goals that can be fulfilled in the short or long term.<br/>... moral.<br/>... the time it takes to build relations.<br/>... family and different kind of groups that the player has created.<br/>... status.<br/>... the loyalty against different factions.<br/>... and other things that the player, through the character, care about.<br/><br/><b>The game mechanics</b>, meaning ...<br/>... resource management, with finite resources.<br/>... resources that you can put at stake to either gain more or loose.<br/>... the character's competence.<br/>... the character's advancement.<br/>... the character's health.<br/>... and other things that is a part of the character's freedom to do whatever it want.<br/><br/><b>The gaming experience</b>, with things like ...<br/>... positive engagement, where you care because the things happening are so god damn cool.<br/>... control over the narrative.<br/>... the time an adventure takes to play.<br/>... positive feedback from the others.<br/>... emotional investments, where what you play out get a response.<br/>... sharing experience/background from real life with what happens in the game.<br/>... spending time creating things.<br/>... and other things that is happening around the table.<br/><br/>I want to pick out two words in that second last sentence: "time" and "create". By having the player spend time on something, you raise the player's investment. When playing that Poker tournament, even if you haven't paid an entry fee, reaching the final means that you have invested time into it. The longer you play, the more you have invested. I played games that became boring to me after a while, but I still played it to it's end because I invested a lot of time in it. Time I didn't want to feel was spent on nothing.<br/><br/>The player creating something is an easy way to create a bond. Making up elements in the story (fictional positioning), putting a character's life at stake in horror games, or even creating an unknown uncle for that Call of Cthulhu game are all ways of creating investments. All games should involve investments in one way or another.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422291/#Comment_422291" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-02T05:48:46+00:00" title="October  2, 2013  5:48AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2017 4:11PM by Rickard.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will now tie everything together.<br/><br/>WHY - the purpose of playing\n<blockquote>Competition: to try to beat the game or the other participants in different aspects of the game.<br/>Exploration: to explore different WHATs in the game and their interactions.<br/>Expression: to express yourself in different ways through the game.<br/>Sensation: to get an experience, to get an insight, to feel, to escape from reality, to be nostalgic.<br/>[edit] Destruction: the thrill of destroy things created or of render something useless, like powergaming in a system. <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/427298#Comment_427298" rel="nofollow">More information</a> appeared later in this thread.</blockquote>\nHOW ... to play\n<blockquote>Uncertainty: uncertainty creates curiosity.<br/>Decision: what you basically do in games. <i>REMOVED.

A way of communicating within the game.<br/>Group: the participants and their relations within the group.<br/>Fiction: the story being told.<br/>Setting: the place where the story is being told and the people occupying it.</blockquote>\nIt's important to notice that alone is nothing, and that a game is a combination of different WHYs, HOWs and WHATs. I want to point out that you normally can't avoid including all of the WHYs and HOWs, even if some of them seems almost diminishing, and that it's good to see each one on a separate scale. You can have a game with 90 % competition and 75 % exploration, or a game that mostly is based on dilemmas (a kind of decision) but that will still include investment, effort and uncertainty in some grade.<br/><br/>I'm personally not interesting in categorizing games, and I wont support that idea. What I've been doing is stepping outside roleplaying games to see what other things that are out there. Use this above to create sparks of ideas and also to find new ways of playing. Perhaps you want to make a game about decisions. What kind of decisions and how should you use them? Perhaps you would like to create a setting to play in, or make a game about expressing who you are. You could also play around by mixing elements that you have no idea what to do with. What would a game be like that is based on exploration, sensation, investment, effort and group?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422293/#Comment_422293" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-02T07:09:12+00:00" title="October  2, 2013  7:09AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 2, 2013 7:14AM by Rickard.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [edit] Ops, I accidentally clicked Save Comment instead of Save Draft.

By trying to reach that goal, the players will understand the purpose of the game - which doesn't have to be related at all with the object. A game who's purpose is to create a comfortable feeling within the group can have a goal where it's about creating a solution to a problem. In the same way, a lot of board games gives out the object of the game in the beginning of the text  so the reader has to figure out the WHY while reading the HOWs and WHATs (read: how to handle the rules).<br/><br/>In a way, the object of the game is a WHAT that tells HOW to reach WHY. Or is it? Could it be a HOW, together with decision, uncertainty, effort and investment, but it doesn't tell how to use the WHATs, only what's expected of them; on why to use them. Emergence is the result of the WHATs interacting. The object of a game is like that, but just as emergence it stands outside the model. It's something that makes the participants act in the first place. This is as true as in any activity, may it be sports, video game, board games, or roleplaying games. If the <i>player</i>, and not character, has no goal, the player wont know why to play the game in the first place.<br/><br/>Few games tells the WHY, and that makes me wonder. Instead, we got this mysterious "object of the game".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422421/#Comment_422421" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-04T09:50:58+00:00" title="October  4, 2013  9:50AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, at least in boardgames, unraveling the WHY is an additional nice exploration experience (think of how good it feels to open up the box and check the contents for the first time; or in subsequent times when you show it to new players, how their expression changes to show the same emotion), but it depends on having a direct WHAT and a clear HOW, otherwise the original intent of the author is lost, unless the intent was to make me complete the WHAT or the HOW and enjoy the ludic part of the creative process. <br/><br/>But then we're talking about a deeper and more detailed design, which I can't say it hasn't been the intent of any designer whose game I've seen -not that they didn't achieve it.

It's about designing art - and I would even go so far to say it's about designing activities. It is funny, because McCloud did exactly what I'm doing now: he had to step out of his medium to be able to understand it better. At pages 165 and forward, things get interesting. There he talks about the primal brain, and how people are saying that we just want to eat and copulate. But there is more to it. To beat boredom, the cave man activated in physical activity or an outlet of emotional imbalance (self expression). These random activities led to discovery. Again, I can look at my own WHYs and find similarities: competition, expression, exploration, and sensation.<br/><br/>He continues with saying that creation of any work in any medium follows the same six steps.\n<blockquote>Idea/Purpose: the creator's drive of why to do art.<br/>Form: book, chalk drawing, song, sculpture etc.<br/>Idiom: what kind of style to use, what kind of genre it's about.<br/>Structure: story arcs, game mechanics - in how to compose the work.<br/>Craft: how well the art is created.<br/>Surface: what the things that stand out, and are first to be noticed.</blockquote>\nIan Schreiber makes a comparison <a href="http://gamedesignconcepts.wordpress.com/2009/07/16/level-6-games-and-art/" rel="nofollow" target="_new">on his blog</a> of the six steps and Marc LeBlanc's MDA - mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics - which is basically about how the mechanics have a dynamic that creates an aesthetics. What's interesting is that both McCloud and LeBlanc says that the creator is going from one direction (idea...surface <i>or</i> mechanics...aesthetics) but the audience takes in the art/game from the other direction, starting with surface or aesthetics.<br/><br/>Schreiber goes even further and states that McClouds six steps is an extension of MDA where structure, craft, and surface corresponds to mechanics, dynamics and surface. He's half right. MDA and my Why, How, What is similar, but when I'm applying my principle to comics, I see a pattern.<br/><br/>CREATOR<br/>Idea/purpose: WHY<br/>Form: HOW<br/>Idiom: WHAT<br/><br/>PARTICIPANT<br/>Structure: WHAT<br/>Craft: HOW<br/>Surface: WHY<br/><br/>[edit] A game theorist pointed out that Surface should be WHY and Structure is WHAT, and not the other way around. I agree, and changed my opinion.<br/><br/>In other words, we have two layers of the same principle, but from different people. This made me think. I wrote the following about objects of the game: "If the player, and not character, has no goal, the player wont know why to play the game in the first place". I would say that we in roleplaying games have three layers: creator, participant, character.<br/><br/>Think about this: the creator has an idea and creates a game that the participants experience. In that game, the participant has an idea and creates a character that is experienced by the others in the game. Add the game master to this, and my brain will explode. And as well as the participants can go from surface and discover all steps up to idea/purpose, it's the same thing with the participants experiencing the other characters. So it's actually nine steps, and not six.<br/><br/>A conclusion: so far, I've been talking about WHW (why, how, what) where the participant has been involved - about the medium itself. The lowest layer of Scott McCloud's six steps. The object of the game is possibly the WHY in that. I've also been talking about the creator's WHY, but that's a layer above what I thought I was talking about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422550/#Comment_422550" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-07T10:54:09+00:00" title="October  7, 2013 10:54AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2014 6:55AM by Rickard.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm quoting from Skapande dramatik (eng. Creative drama) that I started with in this thread. Replace "creative drama" with "roleplaying games" below and you will find I how I want to play roleplaying games. (My translation)\n<blockquote>Creative drama is a creative activity. Play is the essence. Not to play alone, but together. It's not being aware of or compare performing that's most important. We need to do things for their own sake - without thought of reward from audience. Children playing, aren't interrupting from time to time to receive applause, right?</blockquote>- page 8\n<blockquote>The most important thing with creative drama is to create comfort, so no one is feeling targeted of the leader's or the group's dislike /.../ To reach this comfort within the group, each individual should feel comfort and nerveless. It's of course an exchange between the individual comfort zone and the group's. /.../ The comfort depends on the group dynamic. It's not up to one, but everybody, on how the activity is proceed. If the individual is just one part of the whole, the pressure of perform will succumb and, with that, the risk of feeling personal failure.</blockquote>- page 25\n<blockquote>One of the questions that occur with improvisation is to use speech or not. Nothing is more right than another, but many feels it's easier to do improvisation without speech. /.../ That feeling can possibly come from the fact that we're using speech regularly in communication.</blockquote>- page 27<br/><br/>The author Rickard Wikholm gives some non-verbal collaborative exercises as example to release tension or to build a group dynamic. I've been thinking about this, and I'm almost always use verbal exercises (at conventions) to make the players understand how to play the games. Perhaps we should, instead of verbal exercises, draw a map together first, or do non-verbal communication exercises, like learning hand gestures for how to hand over a topic to another participant. <br/><br/>I have a verbal exercise to introduce "Yes, and" and "Yes, but" and I thought up to this point that I did that as a pedagogy tool (I included it in <b>This Is Pulp</b>). That's only a part of why it's successful. It also builds a group dynamic, so we know how to communicate. It creates a comfort, and by telling the players that we are all in this together (I almost never put the GM above the players) and that the players can use these two phrases to build on each other's ideas, I reduce the pressure of performing.<br/><br/>Of performing.<br/><br/>When I wrote about effort as a HOW, I talked about participating. These things that I talk about here is nothing more than structures for making people participating. To release tension, to make them comfortable in improvising, and to make everybody feel that they add to the whole. That's what will create an intrinsic award ("feeling good"), rather than us giving out dog candy such as XP, artha and whatnot. Wikholm writes "We need to do things for their own sake", and I can't do any else than fully agree.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422562/#Comment_422562" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-07T14:33:20+00:00" title="October  7, 2013  2:33PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2013 2:33PM by WarriorMonk.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You just reminded me, I've always wanted do design a game around the concept used for the <a href="http://www.whereareyourkeys.org/" rel="nofollow">language learning method "Where Are Your Keys"</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422569/#Comment_422569" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-07T16:05:25+00:00" title="October  7, 2013  4:05PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2013 4:06PM by Rickard.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You just reminded me, I've always wanted do design a game around the concept used for the <a href="http://www.whereareyourkeys.org/" rel="nofollow">language learning method "Where Are Your Keys"</a></blockquote>\nIf you do, I will playtest it and I will probably steal the ideas. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> It seems like the method of fluency play but with a hive mind principle, or gamification taken to the next level. I really liked this part in their <a href="http://www.whereareyourkeys.org/techniques.html#start" rel="nofollow" target="_new">technique map</a>: "it's more important to learn the structures the language uses to talk about things, than it is to learn long vocab lists of nouns or adjectives. Once players have learned to talk about three nouns fluently, new nouns can be added quickly and easily."<br/><br/>This is what I'm doing with my "Yes, and/but" exercise. Showing the structure of communication.<br/><br/>The following also gave me something to think about: "In an ideal WAYK language-learning setup, the game is designed so that it's perfectly obvious what everyone is saying, even if you aren't familiar with the actual words they're using."<br/><br/>I'm playing with the thought of using hand gestures to steer the conversation. The last year, we've been playing <b>Svart av kval, vit av lust</b> - a game that uses a hand gesture to order a player character to do something, and another gesture to signal that it's time to cut the scene - and it worked beautifully. So off course, I want to expand this. Perhaps a signal for "I don't know where to go anymore, can someone take over?", "I have in idea, I want to cut in." and similar. Sure, people can say this but hand gestures doesn't break the flow as a verbal commands would do. What I also thought about was introducing these by playing out exercises at the beginning of the session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_422667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus" title="The_Magus (Banned)"><img alt="The_Magus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus">The_Magus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422667/#Comment_422667" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-09T15:40:08+00:00" title="October  9, 2013  3:40PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Learning how all the components in the system interacts, and what kind of input results in what kind of output.

To co-operate in creating a story - or a sense of feeling - together."</blockquote>\nYikes.  I really have to voice my objection to some of the ideas in this thread.  Other people have voiced their concerns over the adoption or creation of a language of aesthetics which can describe role-playing and I can agree with this.<br/><br/>What do you want your theory to do?  As a latecomer to The Forge I found it an interesting place where people appeared to use theoretical ideas from GNS Theory to develop games with a largely narrativist bent based on people describing what happened in actual play.  That's great - it did what it set out to do.  But what are you trying to do in this cut and paste approach?  I don't feel particularly enlightened by drama teachers saying how to build a group dynamic.<br/><br/>Human systems are much more confounding that a lot of these "experts" appear to understand.  I say this as a systemic psychotherapist and someone with 12 years of experience running psychotherapy groups.  Your ideas about systems are just plain wrong.  In such a creative endeavour as role-playing you cannot predict the outcome of a system cased on its inputs.  When I'm working with families I have no idea of the outcomes of any of my therapeutic input.  I know that what they are saying is that things have become unsatisfactory for them.  Often one person assumes I will take their side and whole-heartedly agree with them in a dispute.  It just doesn't work this way.  I'm trying to understand the pattern and history of this disagreement.<br/><br/>Group thinking and group feeling is a slippery slope.  Who gets to say the group is performing well?  Your experience of a group being wonderful might be my experience of a group being sucky.  Based on Bion's theory of groups a group needs a primary task.  Fine, how are you going then to define the task of a role-playing group?<br/><br/>There is something in looking at the patterns of communication within RPGs that might be worthwhile but the idea that you can create a game system that will give you a guaranteed output is absurd.  To use a drama analogy I can read Shakepeare but he doesn't tell me how to act.  I can read Stanislavsky but that won't make me an actor.  I can go and see King Lear performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company or the local school.  I cannot say which one will be "better," as I might derive a greater enjoyment from seeing a friend in the school version.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422674/#Comment_422674" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-09T19:32:16+00:00" title="October  9, 2013  7:32PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 9, 2013 7:44PM by Rickard.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I said that all emergence can be predicted, then I made a mistake.

Learning how all the components in the system interacts, and what kind of input results in what kind of output."<br/><br/>"Learning emergence is fun, so design for emergence" was the motto. Not "A game designer should predict the players' behaviors".<br/><br/>If the following sentence was that threw you off, then ignore it: ""Note, the participants are also components and learning them is learning to predict the outcome in the whole gaming experience."<br/><br/>It was a poor choice of words. I mostly had in mind, when I wrote that sentence, a group that I played a lot of GM-free and structured freeform with, where the game itself didn't give much input. After a while, I started to see pattern in how people thought and every game seemed the same. Not in what happened but in how it happened. However, people could still surprise by taking on an unexpected role or even game style.

Ideas raised by Dom <a href="lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/753#18" rel="nofollow" target="_new">over at lumpley</a>, and I think it's an interesting angle. When it comes to the WHY, I guess it's basically the object of the game. What I think is interesting is how a WHY on a higher layer creates a limitation for the WHYs on lower layers.\n<blockquote>CREATOR: the object of the game is to make people discuss strategy.<br/>PARTICIPANT: the object of the game is to survive.<br/>CHARACTER: the object of the game is to find treasures.<br/><br/>CREATOR: the object of the game is to make people behave like douchebags.<br/>PARTICIPANT: the object of the game is to make the character fail it's goal.<br/>CHARACTER: the object of the game is to follow my religion.</blockquote>\nIn roleplaying games, the game master should also be inserted here. I will leave it open if it's just another participant or if the game master is a layer atop of the other players. I will leave it open because these are ideas that are new to me. What is a good WHY, and how should it participants get to know them? To answer the second question, games usually leave out the object for the game that the creator had in mind. The participants normally get to know the goal for their sake (in boardgames: winning condition), and from that form a strategy for their character to fulfill that goal (in boardgames: the tokens to move on the board). By experience the other characters' objects for the game, and then the participants, the group can then explore and perhaps discover the creator's WHY. I'm not saying that this is the way to go, but it can be a part of the playing experience.<br/><br/>So what is a good WHY? For the creator, a loose one will not help the participants at all. "To play for fun" is an example of this. I wonder however what the downside is with having a too narrow WHY in the top layers. Will the game be predictable (no uncertainty)? Will the decision be fewer? Will the chance increase of one participant destroying another participant's object of the game earlier in the game because they will clash?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423087/#Comment_423087" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-17T22:22:00+00:00" title="October 17, 2013 10:22PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2014 6:58AM by Rickard.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will continue trying different angles from what I've come up with so far. This time it's about the HOWs.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://erebaltor.se/rickard/utmaningar5.jpg"/><br/><br/>You can't really have a game that doesn't include investment, uncertainty, decision and effort in some way, but what does it mean to combine them?<br/><br/><b>Gamble</b> (investment+uncertainty): Rolling a die isn't fun in itself, even if you invest time in doing it, because you want something out of it. If we instead put something at stake, like money or the character's life, you will get <i>excitement</i> from the progress.<br/><br/><b>Planning</b>: (investment+decision): You're driving a car. You got the option of driving to your destination fast and spend a lot of gas, or driving economically. You will save gas money but the trip will take time. When you got decisions about different investments, <i>tension</i> will build. What will the consequence be of your decision?<br/><br/><b>Struggle</b> (investment+effort): You want to get fit, so you start to run every third day. You will spend time (investment) and it will take effort, but you will get something back. Effort isn't about if you make it or not, that's uncertainty, and it has very little decision-making in it. While running, it's a <i>challenge</i> for you. According to flow theory, you need to keep it challenging for you to not be boring or to avoid frustration because it's to hard. You can do that by changing the distance of running.<br/><br/>When creating a game, you can look at these feelings. What do you want from your game? Excitement? Challenge? Tension? What components from uncertainty, effort and decision can you use to build that? What will be put at stake, and what will the participants gain from it?<br/><br/>You can go even further and combine gamble+planning, planning+struggle, and struggle+gamble. Combining for example gamble and planning is another way of saying uncertainty+investment+decision. This will also create excitement and tension, if built in a right way.<br/><br/>Like I said in the beginning, you can't really avoid having each one of investment, uncertainty, decision and effort. That's pretty much the same thing as saying that a game consist of the feelings <i>excitement, challenge</i> and <i>tension</i>. You can opt for one or two of these feelings, but the third one will always show up in some minor degree.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423090/#Comment_423090" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-17T23:46:21+00:00" title="October 17, 2013 11:46PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 6, 2014 5:19AM by Rickard.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally, I think that stochastic uncertainty (dice and similar) has a too big influence in roleplaying games today. People tend to think that rolling for Lockpick is a challenge, when it's more about <i>excitement</i>. I would love roleplaying games to explore other kinds of uncertainties, like emergent complexity, hidden energy and such. <b>Archipelago</b> is a perfect example of social contingency with it's ritual phrases. "Describe more" or "Try another way" are perfect examples of social contingency, where the other participants can steer, or put obstacles in the way of, the one who narrates.<br/><br/>We got a lot of decision-making in "indie games", but these are often obstructed by the stochastic uncertainty. For example, I have two options: Alpha and Beta. Alpha is easy to go through with but gives very little back. Beta is harder, but the payoff is greater. I feel that roleplaying game designers then throw in dice rolls in this because that's how roleplaying games normally work. If I have a 95 % chance of succeeding with Alpha, and 60 % chance of succeeding with Beta - the die roll can render my decision useless. I can see the same tendencies in video games. Golem Arcana is a successful kickstarter project by Jordan "Shadowrun" Weisman. It's launched as a strategic game, but the game mechanics has still stochastic uncertainties.<br/><br/>And where's the love for effort in roleplaying games? The game master got effort, when improvising, and so do GM-less games. "Creating a story together" is nothing more than effort. I like <b>Dread</b> only by the fact that it takes a <i>physical effort</i> to play it (drawing tiles from a Jenga tower). In video games, you got FPS where shooting someone serves both as effort and performative contingency. In <b>Diplomacy</b>, you have to convince people to make allies. In the roleplaying game <b>Magicians</b>, you learn Korean while playing.<br/><br/>I will summarize these three paragraphs with an example. Let say that I got the task of creating <i>Game of Thrones: the RPG</i>. [EDIT] The players choose characters that will compete for the throne. They got five procedures to choose from when they want their characters to achieve something. Perhaps one procedure is about establishing something in the game. It could also be about brainstorming together. Or setting up a scene. The game master can apply "Say yes, or answer back with a procedure" at any time when one of the procedures are used. No dice, but still effort (competing within the rules), investment (the struggle to achieve the character's goal), decision-making (what procedure to use and when) and uncertainty (not knowing what procedures the other participants will choose).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423188/#Comment_423188" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-19T06:58:41+00:00" title="October 19, 2013  6:58AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 19, 2013 7:00AM by Rickard.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "And where's the love for effort in roleplaying games?" Well ... effort is basically participating: by following the rules, by making an effort in contributing, by adopting to situations, and much more. In combination with investment, it's a struggle. It's a struggle to follow the rules while taking care of your investment. In my third post in this thread, I talked about how we have forgotten to include the basics. In how to participate - in how to play - a roleplaying game. In my second post, I talked about what creative drama does with children and how that's the essence of roleplaying games. To be creative, sensible, flexible, original, emotional stable, co-operable and group-orientated.<br/><br/>It's good to think about how to create effort in a roleplaying game, by making the players describe their actions, calculate outcomes, seeing connections, forming plans, talking their way out of things, and other mental, social and even physical tasks. But what I rather talk about is how to make the players participate, instead of what they have to do <i>while</i> actually participating. That's what going back to the basics is all about!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423383/#Comment_423383" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-26T02:34:11+00:00" title="October 26, 2013  2:34AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2014 6:59AM by Rickard.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I glanced through the table of content in Start With Why by Simon Sinek.

You've mentioned Improv as one method of storycrafting. As someone who has practiced improv for years, I thought I might add something for you and everyone to think about. \n<blockquote><blockquote>One of the questions that occur with improvisation is to use speech or not. Nothing is more right than another, but many feels it's easier to do improvisation without speech. /.../ That feeling can possibly come from the fact that we're using speech regularly in communication.</blockquote>- page 27<br/><br/>The author Rickard Wikholm gives some non-verbal collaborative exercises as example to release tension or to build a group dynamic. I've been thinking about this, and I'm almost always use verbal exercises (at conventions) to make the players understand how to play the games. Perhaps we should instead draw a map together first, or do non-verbal communication exercises to learn gestures for how to hand over a topic to another. <br/><br/>I have a verbal exercise to introduce "Yes, and" and "Yes, but" and I thought up to this point that I did that as a pedagogy tool (I included it in <b>This Is Pulp</b>). That's only a part of why it's successful. It also builds a group dynamic, so we know how to communicate. It creates a comfort, and by telling the players that we are all in this together (I almost never put the GM above the players) and that the players can use these two phrases to build on each other's ideas, I reduce the pressure of performing.<br/><br/>Of performing.<br/><br/>When I wrote about effort as a HOW, I talked about participating. These things that I talk about here is nothing more than structures for making people participating. To release tension, to make them comfortable in improvising, and to make everybody feel that they add to the whole. That's what will create an intrinsic award ("feeling good"), rather than us giving out dog candy such as XP, artha and whatnot. Wikholm writes "We need to do things for their own sake", and I can't do any else than fully agree.</blockquote>\n"Yes, and" is the foundation of improvisation. "Yes, but" gives me pause, because it causes problems. <br/><br/>When an improviser on stage gives a line, they are saying (either aloud or implicitly) "Yes, and." This is actually a standard introductory game when learning improv theater: progressing a scene by starting with a "Yes, and" with each line:<br/><br/>"It's a lovely day outside!" <br/>"Yes, and that's exactly why I brought a picnic!" <br/>"Yes, and there are now dinosaurs following your scent!" <br/>"Yes, and I'm glad I left my superpowered weapons arsenal in the back seat of my car!" <br/><br/>In four lines, probably less than a minute of speaking on stage, you've added more to one scene than you might ever be able to address and fully resolve in some game systems. It appears as if there's no complex "system" at work, but that couldn't be farther from the truth. <br/><br/>Line 1 establishes a setting for the players. <br/>Line 2 accepts the setting, establishes goals and motives for the responder, and establishes something for both players to participate in. <br/>Line 3 adds a complication that escalates the situation, provides both players with context to further progress on their situation, firmly establishes a motivation for both players to resolve their situation, and provides both players with a tool (the scent) they could potentially use as part of their resolution. <br/>Line 4 proposes a solution to the escalating situation, creates tools for both players to enact the proposed resolution, and a means to which they can further develop their relationship and the situation - either towards more escalation or a resolution. <br/><br/>"Yes, and" is the fundamental purpose of improvisation. "Yes" accepts what you are offered; "and" allows you to offer something of your own. When your gaming group continues on these lines of "Yes, and," you build the dynamic you've described. This touches at the core of just about every story game you could possibly cook up, and everything out there already. And Improv! <br/><br/>My issue with "Yes, but" as a method of teaching a game is that it seems contrary to the goal of fostering group creativity. For example: <br/><br/>"It's a lovely day outside!" <br/>"Yes, but instead of having the freedom to enjoy the outdoors as you please, your supervisor has asked you to hold a picnic. What have you prepared for your picnic?" <br/><br/>Stopping here because two cardinal rules of improv have already been broken. <br/><br/>1) The responder's "Yes" firmly denies the speaker. "Yes" is an acknowledgement, but (see how it works?) it is immediately turned into a rebuke. If it wasn't clear by "Yes, but," the continuing explanation is a MASSIVE denial of the speaker's statement. "Yes, what you said is true, but I am going to reduce and lessen your offering." <br/>2) Anything could happen during this "lovely day outside," but now the speaker's freedom to actually <i>interact</i> with this setting has been greatly diminished. This scene is set to move forward within the confines of the explicit and seemingly arbitrary directions. Purpose and action is still provided, but the flat denial makes it seem as if the first speaker's offering of "a lovely day outside" was not enough. <br/>3) The offered situation isn't further developed, and is instead rebuked with a question. Instead of an affirming "and" along with an offering of more supporting detail and development, the question asks for more from the first speaker. "What more can you give me? What else should you have added to this?" This creates a one-sided relationship between players: always taking, never giving in return.  <br/><br/>The end result is quite the opposite of the happy "Yes, and" scene. As a fellow GM I am plenty guilty being <b>this</b> GM, rather than a "Yes, and" GM. Instead of accepting what's given to me by a player and working with it, I deny creativity and demand more detail, more minutiae that may or may not actually move the narrative forward. The point is that in storytelling, "Yes, but" can deny creativity and shut down the shared creative process, even if your intended purpose is to inspire the creative process.<br/><br/>I don't want to suggest that any sort of setting would constrain players and kill the creative process. A firmly established setting (and even a scenario with motivations and goals for player character(s) built right in) can produce wildly creative scenarios. In improv all players are on an equal footing, and no one player is supposed to manipulate the scene in a way that cheapens the other players' offerings and creativity. I feel that in some games the opposite is encouraged or at least practiced: the GM feels responsible to manipulate players by limiting their options or placing needlessly difficult impediments and denials ahead of their players' creativity. <br/><br/><br/>There's plenty more stuff that improv touches on: nonverbal cues and gestures, mechanics/process and complexity, etc. You can see how anyone that has practiced improv could go on for days about any one particular aspect...I had to stop myself from delving into anything else. <br/><br/>Many improv teaching manuals have gamified methods of practicing the fundamentals outside of just "here's one word, make a ten minute scene out of it." Improv teaches things that I've felt make me a better GM*, and GM'ing has taught me things that make me a better improviser. If any GM is concerned with group participation and inspiring a sense of shared creativity and spontaneity, instead of trying to devise any sort of Universal Player Engagement Core Rulebook, just pick up an improv manual. Academic theater has its place, but modern improv theater relates more directly to storytelling games in my opinion - to the point that a decent storytelling game could derive its mechanics from any number of improv games already in existence....and maybe a small handful of dice.<br/><br/><a href="http://improvencyclopedia.org/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://improvencyclopedia.org/index.html</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423888/#Comment_423888" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-07T08:23:04+00:00" title="November  7, 2013  8:23AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 18, 2013 4:37AM by Rickard.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent post, and I agree. It seems like roleplaying gamers has taken "yes, and" but interpreted it into their own style and, by doing that, kind of lost the purpose of the technique in the first place. Games like <b>InSpectres</b>, as an example, where instead of using "and" as an acceptance of what the other did, the system force the player to add something more to the description.<br/><br/>(I could say that your "Yes, and there are now dinosaurs following your scent!" is nothing more than a "Yes, but" and it is a way of creating obstacles, but that would just be ignoring the point that you're making.)<br/><br/>Something I like about improv - I haven't done it myself but read a lot about it and adore shows like Whose Line Is It Anyways - is two of the words you used. <i>Accept</i> and <i>offer</i>. That what you say is offered by you to the others to build on. That others should accept what you have to offer. By knowing this the angst about what you're about to offer will decrease. I also like what you wrote "In improv all players are on an equal footing,", and that is what I feel when I'm a game master. I'm not "above" the rest of the participants. I just have different tasks at hand.

This changed my view in how to design games and I now always aim to design for learning.

(I'm only giving three examples of WHATs.

Scott McCloud talks about boredom instead of fun and how we activate ourselves to fight boredom. (The whole book is a comic so the quotes can be weird.)\n<blockquote>It's a happy fact of human existence that we simply can't spend our every waking hour eating and having sex! No matter how frantically we pursue our goals, there will inevitably be times when we just don't have a thing to do.<br/><br/>What may look like a tribe of bored, inactive cave-dwellers below us is, in fact, a thriving art colony!<br/><br/>See that old woman with the stick?

(MCloud's remark: sport and games) [my remark: what I include in "competition"]<br/><br/>Second, they provide an outlet for emotional imbalances, aiding in the race's mental survival!

You see, applied like Bape_Escape described it will do nothing but work in detriment of the group's fun, no discussion there. And I admit there's a lot of groups that make this mistake and limit their own fun. But then, why does this technique still sees use?<br/><br/>Because there's actually an appropiate moment to use it, and that's when it looks like the fun is over. Say, go for a while with "yes, and" on the picnic example. You'll probably come to the moment where you have a dead dinosaur over your picnic and you're standing victorious over it. Everything is all right, you've got a happy ending and the current flow of creativity has been exhausted. And then somebody has another idea to keep the fun going on. That's the moment when that person says "Yes, we won, but now we see this isn't the only dinosaur around! It's an alien dinosaur invasion!". I think I'd safely assume it also works with bad endings.<br/><br/>So there, crativity re-ignited and the game can continue. Not necessarily blocking anything else but the conclussion of the story/game.

How "Yes, and" is handled in roleplaying games is that the <i>player</i> creates the "...and". The <i>game master</i> creates obstacles through "Yes, but". What I thought was so refreshing was that <a href="/forums/profile/Babe_Escape">@Babe_Escape</a> wrote about how "Yes, and" should be used by the <i>others</i>. It's what I've been talking about in this thread: building on each other's ideas. How "Yes, and" usually is handled in roleplaying games (like in <b>InSpectres</b>) is almost like a variant of the Czege principle.<br/><br/>I totally get your point in creating obstacles and I can see how it creates creativity - because I usually play like that myself - but what if you don't seek conflicts in a roleplaying game? We are so keen on creating conflicts that we somehow thinks they must be a part of roleplaying games.

Yeah, I read those.  I was just hoping you hadn't left them behind in favor of a new theory.

Koster doesn't say "Fun is another way of learning". To quote from his <a href="http://www.theoryoffun.com/resources.shtml" rel="nofollow">A Theory of Fun: 10 Years Later</a>, where he quotes Chris Crawford: "fun is the emotional response of learning".<br/><br/>Let say we have a procedure.

It's not until after the procedure that I can feel the joy of learning something: perhaps I got answer to existential questions or perhaps getting hope in my life? (These are examples of sensation.) "Fun" occurs after the procedure. When I read Start With Why (a suggestion from this thread), I got revelations <i>while </i>reading the book and the book made me start thinking.

It will be a different gaming experience if you roll often compared to if you roll seldom.

Why is that?<br/><br/>WHY - the purpose of playing<blockquote>    Competition: to try to beat the game or the other participants in different aspects of the game.<br/>    Exploration: to explore different WHATs in the game and their interactions.<br/>    Expression: to express yourself in different ways through the game.<br/>    Sensation: to get an experience, to get an insight, to feel, to escape from reality, to be nostalgic.</blockquote>\nI will now talk about a WHY that I haven't included because I haven't felt that it should be part of a game: <i>destruction</i>. I have now come to reevaluate my opinion, and it's mostly because of Roger Caillois' ilinx. Ilinx is part of his <a href="http://blog.ihobo.com/2007/08/roger-caillois.html" rel="nofollow">Pattern of Play</a> where you can find terms as agon (competition), mimicry (simulation and characteration), alea (randomness), and also ludus and paidia which I <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/420773#Comment_420773" rel="nofollow">talked about earlier</a>. From his book Les Jeux et Les Hommes ("Man, Play and Games").\n<blockquote>Ilinx. The last kind of game includes those which are based on the pursuit of vertigo and which consist of an attempt to momentarily destroy the stability of perception and inflict a kind of voluptuous panic upon an otherwise lucid mind. In all cases, it is a question of surrendering to a kind of spasm, seizure, or shock which destroys reality with sovereign brusqueness.</blockquote><blockquote>In parallel fashion, there is a vertigo of moral order, a transport that suddenly seizes the individual. This vertigo is readily linked to the desire for disorder and destruction,</blockquote>\nIt's the second part that I find interesting. Crashed cars at the side of the road has a tendency to be set of fire after a while. Why is that? Boys throws rock at windows to shatter them in an abandoned factory. You slay countless of mooks in <b>Feng Shui</b>. That's destructive ilinx. Why I haven't included it before was because I felt it only had to do with shadenfreude: the joy of another person's misfortune. Why did the player attack the least dominate player in the boardgame? That has very little to do with competition, but to thrive of the power of suppressing another player. I don't think that belongs in a game, especially social games like roleplaying games.<br/><br/>But shadenfreude is just one part of destruction. You can thrive on destroying your own character. To see it's misfortune and feel sorry for that character. You can build up a world only for the pleasure of destroying it. You can take your character sheet and blow it up with fire crackers. Destruction has a part of gaming, just like the rest of the four WHYs.<br/><br/>[edit] Earlier drafts of Marc LeBlanc's eight kinds of fun had Masochism. It was later renamed into Submission. So it seemed like he had the same idea of destruction being part of why to enjoy a game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427299/#Comment_427299" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-17T03:19:59+00:00" title="January 17, 2014  3:19AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2014 3:24AM by David_Berg.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Some men aren't looking for anything logical like money.

It can be the tokens in Ludo, a character in a video game or participating as a team member in a soccer game. Ever heard someone say "He was caught up in the game so what he did on the field isn't how he is off the field"? Yes, I'm taking the term \xbbcharacter\xab too far but what I want to show is that you always have something you can use to steer the game: to participate in the game, and it doesn't matter if it's you psychically or if it's a token on a board. My standpoint you need take into account to understand what I've written below is: a character is always present.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>You can find an article in <a href="http://www.ropecon.fi/brap/" rel="nofollow">Beyond Role and Play</a> (2004) that Ari-Pekka Lappi has written named The Character Interpretation: The Process Before the Immersion and the Game. The article is about how <i>character immersion</i> happens. In order to interpret the character, in order to understand the character and to be the character, you have to constantly going through the following steps. (quoted below)\n<blockquote>\xd7 A player reads the character and discovers facts about her.<br/>\xd7 If the player already postulated a world view, she tests whether the facts fit the world view. Otherwise the players tries to find a world view that is most stuitable for the character.<br/>\xd7 A player postulates a world view, resulting in the character.<br/>\xd7 After a player had postulated a world view she should be able to explain why the character is described as she is. [return to the first point] If she cannot explain that, she has to choose another world view. [redoing all the steps]</blockquote>\nIt doesn't really matter where you start, like if you like to know about the world before you read the character. That's of less importance. What's important is the constant loop you do between taking in the character and taking the world view and the interpretations you make while jumping between them. This is what creates character immersion.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>In Media Psychology (2007), shit loads of psychologists have contributed to an article called A Process Model for the Formation of Spatial Presence Experiences. I haven't read it myself so I took a shortcut and read <a href="http://www.psychologyofgames.com/2010/07/the-psychology-of-immersion-in-video-games/#foot_text_514_3" rel="nofollow">the following summary</a> instead. That article talks about <i>spatial immersion</i>, which means that when you play a video game, it feels like you're part of the world like if you were really standing there. It suggests two steps to create that. (quoted below)\n<blockquote>   \xd7  Players form a representation in their minds of the space or world with which the game is presenting them.<br/>    \xd7 Players begin to favor the media-based space (I.e., the game world) as their point of reference for where they \u201care\u201d (or to put it in psychological gobblety-gook, their \u201cprimary ego reference frame\u201d)</blockquote>\nSee any similarities to the points in The Character Interpretation? These two points have included the interpretation steps so it's basically two points: the world and where "they" - the character - are.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>When I read this, my thoughts goes as following. The setting is part of the WHATs, so to immerse in the world and/or the character is to make a loop between the character and the <i>setting</i>. Like I stated in my first paragraph, you always have a character even if you don't think of it as a character. What happens if you, instead of setting, puts other things in the loop. What happens if you put meaning in the loop? Will you get immersion in <i>meaning</i>? I myself have already experienced immersion in <i>fiction </i>when playing roleplaying games. When the real world around me dissolves by me being taken by the story produced while we play. I also experienced immersion in <i>structures</i>, when tactical games have sucked my in with it's game mechanics. So it's only one left, and that's immersion in <i>group</i>. I, and you who read this, have probably already been immersed in both meaning and group without realizing it yourself. Have you, for example, ever been deeply involved in a discussion with your friends or <a href="http://www.psychologyofgames.com/2014/03/why-we-love-ellie-from-the-last-of-us/" rel="nofollow">felt a connection to a NPC in a video game</a>? These are some areas that I think we can benefit from exploring in roleplaying games. In exploring how to create immersion in the five WHATs: setting, meaning, fiction, structures, and group.<br/><br/>Getting ideas like this, discovering new ways of playing roleplaying games, is why I made this thread in the beginning. To take in information from sources outside roleplaying games to better understand what we do when practicing our hobby.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429827/#Comment_429827" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-24T10:32:21+00:00" title="March 24, 2014 10:32AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2014 9:57AM by Rickard.">edited September 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The 100th post in this thread. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I will do some repetition of two things that I have touched and referred to in previous posts all through this thread.<br/><br/><b>Flow Theory</b><br/>Mih\xe1ly Cs\xedkszentmih\xe1lyi decided one day to try to find out what creates happiness and his research over the years gave birth to flow. "Flow is the mental state of operation in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity. In essence, flow is characterized by complete absorption in what one does." (Wikipedia)<br/><br/>I really like that it says "fully immersed". I will continue quoting Flow in Games by Jenova Chen:\n<blockquote>According to Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's well-documented research and wide-scale gathering of personal observations, the phenomenology of Flow has eight major components.<br/>1. A challenge activity that requires skills<br/>2. The merging of action and awareness<br/>3. Clear goals<br/>4. Direct feedback<br/>5. Concentration on the task at hand<br/>6. The sense of control<br/>7. The loss of self-consciousness<br/>8. The transformation of time</blockquote>\nTake special interest in the fourth point. Not all of these eight components must be present, but to achieve flow, you need the following. (quote from Flow in Games)\n<blockquote>Once we have digested the above components and revisited them with a game design perspective, here are the three core elements a video game must have in order to evoke Flow experience.<br/>1. As a premise, the game is intrinsically rewarding, and the player is up to play the<br/>game.<br/>2. The game offers right amount of challenges to match with the player\u2019s ability, which<br/>allows him/her to delve deeply into the game.<br/>3. The player needs to feel a sense of personal control over the game activity.</blockquote>\n<b>Skill Atoms</b><br/>Daniel Cook and Raph Koster asked themselves if there wasn't anything hidden behind the game mechanics and aesthetics that comes with a game. That behind all that are some basic foundations, based on human psychology, that could be extracted from all games and could be turned into practical techniques in game design. Play is instinctual and controlled by strong feedback mechanisms in form of boredom and frustration. To beat this off, you seek out to find stimulation. As we participate in these stimulations, may it be playing, we will be rewarded by learning from it. When we're mastering knowledge, skills and tools endomorphin are released in the brain and gives us a sense of joy.<br/><br/>What they came up with was the skill atom, that's the minimal requirement for how the player achieves a new skill. (quote below, <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/129948/the_chemistry_of_game_design.php?print=1" rel="nofollow">source</a>)\n<blockquote> A skill atom feedback loop is composed of four main elements:<br/><br/>-Action:The player performs an action. For a skill atom encounter by a new player, the action might involve pressing a button. More advanced atoms might instead require the player execute a batched set of actions such as navigating a complex maze.<br/><br/>- Simulation: Based off the action, an ongoing simulation is updated. A door might open.<br/><br/>- Feedback:The game provides some form of feedback to the player to let them know how the simulation has changed state. This feedback can be auditory, visual, or tactile. It can be visceral in the form of an exploding corpse or it can be symbolic in the form of a block of text.<br/><br/>- Modeling: As the final step, the player absorbs the feedback and updates their mental models on the success of their action. If they feel that they have made progress, they feel pleasure. If they master a new skill or other tool, they experience an even greater burst of joy. If they feel that their action has been in vain, they feel boredom or frustration.</blockquote>\nNow take in what you just read and connect this to what the previous post wrote about creating immersion. In order to learn, you need a feedback loop of some sort. If I compare this to character immersion: action is the player reading about the character, simulation is when the character is tested against the world, feedback is when the player learns about the world, and modeling is when the player interprets what it just learned. When you do this loop, it's a step of being immersed. When you do this loop of direct feedback, the flow state can occur. When you do this skill atom feedback loop, you will learn and from that possibly get the feeling of joy.<br/><br/>So basically, what I've been describing in the two last posts is not just how to get immersed in different parts of a game, but how an intrinsic reward system can be created, in comparison to extrinsic rewards like artha, XP, fate points, fan mail and similar.

                   Zooming in on the modeling element: It's useful to note that players in videogames spend 80% of their time <i>failing</i> and yet there is a broad buffer between a tactical failure and a literal feeling of frustration with the game.  In this buffer area even tactical failure is experienced in a positive light because it contains a nugget of learning or mastery (cf. McGonigal, "Reality is Broken").  So the low end of positive feedback is actually lower than the fulcrum between objective success and objective failure.  This supports the notion of intrinsic rewards expressed in your final paragraph.  The pleasure response requires that the player make some progress, true, but this progress does not need to be an extrinsic reward.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429971/#Comment_429971" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-25T14:39:26+00:00" title="March 25, 2014  2:39PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2014 7:28AM by Rickard.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            McGonigal's ideas of games saving the world are so weird, but I adore her for it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> When you say that players fail 80 % of the time, do you mean by doing little things, like missing a jump, or grander things like failing an objective in the game (ex. by dying)?<br/><br/>In flow theory, if you succeed too often, the activity will lead to boredom and if you fail to often you will be frustrated instead, like the following picture below shows:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Challenge_vs_skill.svg/300px-Challenge_vs_skill.svg.png"/><br/>(source: Wikipedia)<br/><br/>What kind of conclusions do you draw from that when looking at the flow theory, where failing leads to frustration?<br/><br/>I personally find it interesting how a frustrating game can be enjoyable, like how <a href="http://flappybird.io/?game" rel="nofollow">Flappy Birds</a> is one of the most downloaded games to iPhone. I haven't read much about frustration but I guess that fiero - the feeling of triumph - increases a lot with frustrating games. However, you can't win in Flappy Birds so it's a conundrum for me (and my niece got 36 points when I only achieved nine - God, I hate her! <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> ). It's possible that Flappy Birds triggers that arousal in the image.

The quote is "Perhaps her most significant finding yet is this: gamers spend nearly all of their time failing.  Roughly four times out of five, gamers don't complete the mission, run out of time, don't solve the puzzle, lose the fight, fail to improve their score, crash and burn, or die."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430002/#Comment_430002" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-26T07:46:30+00:00" title="March 26, 2014  7:46AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for checking that up.

I can see that happening in both video- and board games, but I wonder if the numbers change when the medium change, like team sport or tabletop roleplaying games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430008/#Comment_430008" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-26T07:56:48+00:00" title="March 26, 2014  7:56AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 26, 2014 7:57AM by AsIf.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the numbers probably do change for TTRPG.  I mean, of course they do.  But what we lose in somatic excitement we can easily make up in the power of meaningful <i>drama</i>.  In the right RPG setting and circumstance, it can be amazing and meaningful and poignant and feel "complete" to totally, utterly and irrevocably DIE, never again to play that character.  I've never had <i>that</i> feeling from a videogame.  <br/><br/>So... two different animals.

When I was talking with Ron Edwards, after a gaming session, he said that he left immersion out of GNS because it's not even a play style (it's an interpretation of what he said, remembering exact words isn't my forte). That sounded weird to me as a Swede because immersion is such a huge thing in the Nordic countries, especially with the our LARP scene.<br/><br/>But while I was writing about immersion in this thread,  I came to the conclusion that he's absolutely right. Immersion is not a play style, it's a reward for playing. It's autotelic, meaning why we do a task solely for the purpose of doing the task. Note that I'm not talking about the traditional meaning of immersion, to loose yourself in your character, but all kinds of immersion. If you think this is weird, let me instead present another term for immersion: <a href="http://www.psychologyofgames.com/2010/07/the-psychology-of-immersion-in-video-games/" rel="nofollow">presence</a>.<br/><br/>It's my suggestion that you can achieve presence in my five WHATs: setting, group, meaning, structures, and fiction. I've given the a suggestions of components to do that with my HOWs, to create a task that involves decision, uncertainty, effort and investment. I also think that the task have to do with WHY you do something - may it be exploration, sensation, competition, expression or destruction - that the task should correlate with what you find, as a foundation of gaming, interesting with doing a task. The WHYs also change depending on your preconception of the task. If you're used to play D&amp;D in a competitive style with focus on structures, then you wont find it as amusing with another roleplaying game that instead explores fiction. It took me a few years before I liked Forge games (indiegames) before I realized their WHYs.<br/><br/>I always felt that something were missing, and I could now have found the missing link - something that ties WHAT and HOW together - and that's the model for creating presence. To create a loop between what the character stands for or acting against, and what the result is that the character is given back. Let say that you use the skill atom, you first need the player to do an effort to make something happen. Effort is basically about participation, but can be turned up a notch to be more demanding, like having do to twenty push-ups. The consequence of your result will (hopefully) be enough to make you do a decision. The result should have some sort of uncertainty, otherwise you wouldn't be doing the task in the first place, and while doing it you create an investment. It's even possible that you are already invested, like betting money while playing craps.<br/><br/>Something that I've been pondering these last few days is why character isn't one of the five WHATs. My thoughts goes like this: it could be, but none of the five WHATs are required where character is. You don't need either setting or fiction to play craps. You don't need group to play solitaire. One thought that appeared now was that character could be a HOW: a component of the game that must be there but can be almost diminishing. To play craps, you don't have a character per se, but you could put on a certain mask (to drag Jung into this) while playing the game. It's there, but it's as diminished as effort, compared to the other three: decision, uncertainty and investment.<br/><br/>Another thing that can seem weird is that I gave an example of character immersion and setting immersion in my first post about immersion as a reward, but using the same loop. I've now come to believe that it's wrong to see character immersion as being immersed in character. It's more about being immersed in meaning. To sink into what something feels like, based on cultural, social, spiritual or ethical questions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430093/#Comment_430093" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-27T10:45:53+00:00" title="March 27, 2014 10:45AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2014 10:48AM by AsIf.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I mention this because of your final comments about Character and Meaning:  I have an unpublished computer-assisted narrative debugging system in which plotlines and elements are tracked through a three-dimensional grid.  The model derives partly from some observations by Brenda Laurel (cf. "Computers as Theater").  Not going to get into great detail here but just to note: The 3 dimensions that I find irreducible for such a system are <i>Space, Time</i> and <i>Meaning</i>.  Space and Time are abstracted representations of locations and temporal flow, respectively.  The Meaning coordinate is even more abstract, but it represents the appearance of applicable information (positive) OR unanswered questions (negative, ie "known unknowns") in the storyworld.  In my 3D structure, like yours, terms like "Character" and "Immersion" are not present because their existence is assumed.  Character is a substrate.  Immersion is an effect.<br/><br/>Also: Since you're scattershotting for inspiration from other media here, I feel slightly less than totally embarrassed to drag out this old chestnut, in which my younger self brazenly attempted to create a rating scale for "interactivity" across all media types.  In this system, the "Interactivity Rating" of a given medium (from "reading a book" to "direct neural interface") is viewed as being comprised of five traits: <i>Immersion, Realism, Range, Response Speed,</i> and <i>Logical Consistency</i>, and "Immersion" is literally nothing more than the number of senses affected by input.  This breakdown is sophomoric and dated, but I find that it still provides food for thought: <a href="http://asifproductions.com/systems/firm.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://asifproductions.com/systems/firm.html</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430781/#Comment_430781" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-10T01:29:36+00:00" title="April 10, 2014  1:29AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 10, 2014 6:37AM by Rickard.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>terms like "Character" and "Immersion" are not present because their existence is assumed.

In what engages us with each activity.<br/><br/>Reading a book is sensation (WHY) and has uncertainty as a HOW tied to it. You also invest time into the activity.<br/><br/>Talking a walk in the park is also sensation, but involves effort instead of uncertainty. Again, time come in here as an investment.<br/><br/>Playing a game, however, can be about sensation but also competition, exploration, destruction and expression. It can involve all kinds of HOWs, depending on the structures of the game but it should at least include uncertainty and either effort or decision. Investment is here too, not only in time but in honor, money or putting your character's life at stake (as a few examples).<br/><br/>It may seem like games are the best activities to make someone engaged, but this is not a fair comparison because games comes in all kinds of shapes. You can add decision in books by reading a Choose Your Own Adventure. You can add exploration to walking by taking a hike in the mountains. Something I think is important is also the player's WHY and how it corresponds to the game's WHY. If the player comes in with expectations and those expectations are met, the whole activity will be more joyful (I'm assuming here). You know what WHY you get when you read a book, but that's not always the case with a game.<br/><br/>And what happens if you're several people doing an activity where each person has it's own WHY? The next post will go into some of my thoughts about that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430785/#Comment_430785" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-10T02:36:20+00:00" title="April 10, 2014  2:36AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2014 11:34PM by Rickard.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been talking about <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/420929#Comment_420929" rel="nofollow">player types</a> before and from that I formed my WHYs: exploration, expression, competition, sensation, and destruction. I claimed that WHYs are on different scales of each other, where you can have, for example, 80 % competition and 70 % exploration in a game. I will now try this thought from different angles.<br/><br/>An adventure I played at a convention had two distinctive act for the game master. In the first act, it was about exploring the group and establish relationships between hostages and hostage takers. Then the adventure changed and it was more about finding out clues to overcome a threat towards the group.  Participants that played out the first act had trouble with the other act, and participants who didn't do so well with exploring the relations did better at finding out the clues. When talking to the other game masters, they had the experience from the adventure. What happened was that the adventure had a change in playstyle and that didn't turn out well for the whole gaming experience. At best, the session became a mediocre experience.<br/><br/>The card game <b>Once Upon a Time</b> has two WHYs: either you compete in structure and fiction or you explore the fiction with the structures of the game. At best, you ignore the competitive element of the game and create a good story, or you play to win which resolves in a bad story. In most cases, the group hasn't agreed and the WHYs collide, resulting in a mediocre story and a mediocre competitive experience. When it came to the adventure in the previous paragraph, what I did was to try to recognize what the group wanted. If they were keen on playing out the relationships, I would hold on to the first act as long as I could and then kind of brushed over act two. If they on the other hand didn't pick up on the relationship business, I would trigger the second act earlier. So the adventure gave either a good base for playing out the character but gave a bad clue-finding phase, or the other way around.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Robin D Laws talks about player types in <i>Robin Laws For Good Game Mastering</i>. He writes on page 3 "Everybody comes to the gaming table for slightly different reasons. Our biggest task as GMs is to direct and shape individual preferences into an experience that is more than the sum of its parts." He then talks about the player types.\n<blockquote><b>The Power Gamer </b> (competition) wants to make his character bigger, tougher, buffer, and richer. /.../<br/><br/> <b>The Butt-Kicker</b> (destruction) wants to let off steam with a little old-fashioned vicarious mayhem. /.../<br/><br/> <b>The Tactician</b> (competition/exploration) is probably a military buff, who wants chances to think his way through complex, realistic problems, usually those of the battlefield. /.../<br/><br/> <b>The Specialist</b> (expression/competition) favors a particular character type, which he plays in every campaign and in every setting. /.../To make a specialist happy, you have to create scenes in which his character can do the cool things for which the archetype is known.<br/><br/> <b>The Method Actor</b> (expression) believes that roleplaying is a medium for personal expression, /.../<br/><br/> <b>The Storyteller</b> (expression), /.../ he's more interested in taking part in a fun narrative that feels like a book or a movie than in strict identification with his character. <br/><br/> <b>The Casual Gamer</b> (sensation) is often forgotten in discussions of this sort, but almost every group has one. Casual gamers tend to be low key folks who are uncomfortable taking center stage even in a small group.</blockquote><a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/theory/models/robinslaws.html" rel="nofollow">More reading</a><br/><br/>I've taken the liberty in suggesting the most important WHYs in brackets for each player type above. Different WHATs can distinguish them even further, like how method actor is more about meaning/group (in that order), and storyteller focus more on fiction/meaning (in that order). Balancing the gaming experience is something that I guess most people take for granted in roleplaying games, but I have come to reconsider this. I assumed in the previous post that when our WHYs corresponds to the game's WHY, the gaming experience will be more joyful. This should mean that the games should be specialized on a single WHY but also be clear on what kind of WHY that the participants should expect? I also wonder if you can have the same WHY but with different kinds of WHATs. Would Once Upon a Time be a better game if you compete with both structures and fiction, where you play rivals in a story? Then it would make sense to win in both story and structures. Would Once Upon a Time become a better game if you explore both the fiction and the structures together?<br/><br/>You could also switch between different WHYs and we have examples of that in roleplaying games. <b>D&amp;D4</b> has gotten a lot of crap because you can only fight in that game, but that's not true. You still have the "roleplaying" aspect in the game - Robin D Laws has even written about his player types in the Dungeon Master's Guide. <b>Warhammer FRPG 3</b> is basically the same game as D&amp;D4, but here it's more clear when to switch because they labeled it <i>combat mode</i> and <i>story mode</i>. When we still moved the miniatures around on the board after combat in D&amp;D4, in we ditched the dolls in Warhammer when we realized the switch between combat and story mode. I will leave it open if this is a good solution or not but if I would like to combine different WHYs, I would try to interleave it in each other. Not by mixing them together, but having different layers, where someone who likes expressing themselves can do that in combat while another player, who wants to compete, can do that during "story mode" as well.<br/><br/>I would like to see, some day, a game that can let different people combine their different WHYs in a good way and, at the same time, let it correspond to the game's WHY.<br/><br/>(Side note: when writing about how to combine players' WHYs, I came to realize it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing" rel="nofollow">multiplexing</a>, where WFRPG is using time-division multiplexing and my suggestion is frequency-division multiplexing. There are other types of multiplexing in the Wikipedia article that can perhaps bring new ideas for others.)<br/><br/>[edit] I should point out that I'm not fond of categorizing either players or games into WHYs and WHATs. These things are there for you to understand the focus of your own game and and it's participants. I did however an exception for Laws'es player types but only to show the similarities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431699/#Comment_431699" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-27T05:57:00+00:00" title="April 27, 2014  5:57AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2014 6:06AM by Rickard.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My ideas for the HOWs originated from when I wanted to show my perspective of what kind of feelings certain mechanics bring forth. I was annoyed that people kept calling dice rolls for challenges (Hello, <b>Mouse Guard</b>) when the uncertainty doesn't bring any challenge. Instead, effort is what brings a challenge. I haven't got any of these feelings below from established research, but from observations that I've made through my years of gaming.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://erebaltor.se/rickard/utmaningar5.jpg"/><br/><br/>I've thought about this, and something that annoyed me with my own thesis is that challenge and tension is what happens <i>while</i> doing an activity while excitement is what comes after the uncertainty is solved. What would be a proper emotional response would instead be suspense, but I feel that suspense and tension sounds too alike (am I wrong?) so I would instead say uncertainty creates curiosity. Curiosity is not the whole truth but it gives a notion of the feeling I'm after.<br/><br/>Excitement is instead a feeling that can come from all the three HOWs. I wonder if investment is a HOW or if I should treat that component in a game as I treat character. That it should be something that must be created through the game - either as a stake, as something you create or as something you spend time on - for the game to give excitement. Is it possible that it is investment that gives excitement? As I said before, all of the other three HOWs must be combined with investment for a game to work. If you're not invested in the activity, then the payoff wont be as big or, in some cases, wont happen at all. But like I said before, excitement is something that comes after the task is done. <i>Involvement</i> could instead be the feeling. It sounds a lot like the HOW Effort. Immersion, possibly? You can't immerse in something if you don't invest in it. Is that true?<br/><br/>I'm writing this to show where my thoughts are going. It's possible that it can create a spark of thought for someone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431705/#Comment_431705" name="Item_112" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-27T11:13:46+00:00" title="April 27, 2014 11:13AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just some of my thoughts, <br/><br/>Why do we invest in something?

The fisherman out in the cold may not be thinking about it all the time, but subconciously each of the implements he was using, every movement that he uses to manipulate them, the actual feeling of being soaked while working or waiting to catch something... everything in his mind is related to memories and more than that, to the memory of the things he felt the first time he did that or the first time he mastered his act. That whole river of soothing emotions is good enough to have him glad of waking up early and enduring any weather.<br/><br/>It's the same for any "type" of player. Everyone ends up enjoying a different combination of aspects of the game, which is what makes taxonomies sorta possible. Of course, the player personality also plays an important role. Patience is a good virtue for any fisherman, to the point it helps him enjoy fishing more than the average person. Yet the imprinted memory can be strong enough to make the person accustomed to a conduct different than their usual.<br/><br/>So, how do we apply this knowledge to the game? Well, to have players invest in the game you have to ingrain their emotions in the game. It's actually easier and less "manipulative" than it sounds. Here's some GM advice:<br/><br/>-First of all, people WANT to play. Just by calling the whole activity a <b>game</b> is enough to make them remember similar activities they enjoyed in the past. Newbies will ask "It's like X or Y game" to make sure it's related to a good experience or a bad one, but when they do that question you can be sure you already have their attention.<br/><br/>-Second: use rules everyone is comfortable with or that actually help generate content. That's why ditching encumbrance rules is okay after a couple sessions at least or whenever they don't actually matter. Comfortable in this case also means <i>reliable, practical and efficient for the purposes of the session</i>, which are conveying emotions, allowing players to project back their emotions, built the fiction on that and keep this exchange going, changing and increasing, as this is the nature of what we call now the<i> Flow</i>.<br/><br/>-Third: observe carefully which elements of the fiction receive any kind of emotional charge (which characters they hate, which they like, what objects and places are loaded with meaning for them) and come back to them/reuse them at least once. Actually, once loaded, re-use them to guide the story/build the story around them. But only ONCE if you can help it. If the players bring that element with them into the adventure, feel free to use it more times.<br/><br/>-Fourth: Don't contaminate the fiction with the feelings you have for your creations (as in NPCs, monsters, dungeons, tactics, detailed background, rules which some players are uncomfortable with, etc) because that leads to imposing your feelings about something to the rest of the party. THAT IS ACTUALLY MANIPULATIVE, and while it can be done trough illusionism and collaborationism, both require a lot of work in prep and/or in sweetalking the players into it. If you absolutely go that way, be ready for it or at least be ready to watch players try and destroy your work.<br/><br/>-Fifth: If your answer to the threath above was in the lines of "let's see them try -evil grin-" then what you enjoy is the competition in metagame terms. Before you go there, make sure your players are okay with this kind of competition. It's actually a valid form of fun, as long as everyone is fair with it. Nobody goes changing rules to win or adding points the didn't earn to their character sheet. Decide which manuals you will be using and let the best ruleslawyer/munchkin win. If what you really really like is to cheat in games, screw you.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431767/#Comment_431767" name="Item_118" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-28T14:41:45+00:00" title="April 28, 2014  2:41PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 29, 2014 2:28AM by Rickard.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think what <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_88">@Paul_88</a> brings up is interesting. When I first came up with investment, and attacked it from different perspectives, one of the perspective was about people that are cheering for their favorite football team. There is nothing there that is "theirs", there is nothing there that they can influence, but they do invest a lot into the activity. It's the same deal as following a TV show for seasons after seasons or subscribing to someone on Youtube: after a while, they become part of your life.<br/><br/>If we look my <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/422288#Comment_422288" rel="nofollow">original list of investments</a>, being a fan is connected to your inner sphere for the character (as in "being a fan" - yes, I realize the strained use of the term). But being a fan, or a fisherman, also says something about who you are. It's connected to something in your earlier life, for example, where you grew up or how influenced you were by your acquaintances.<br/><br/>What I think is interesting, when I read what Paul wrote, is that investment somewhere along the way - after spending a lot of time with it - becomes expression. If you do a lot of thievery, you will - after a while - consider yourself a thief and use that to express yourself. All this makes me question whether investment is a HOW or not. Perhaps it's something that must be a part of it's own, and stand above the whole model, just like "character" is.<br/><br/>Also, think about how some video games - I have games like The Walking Dead and The Last of Us in mind now - creates investments in characters through choices or sharing experiences with the characters - either by playing them or getting to know them through interaction.<br/><br/>(As a side note: I like how my play of thoughts created more of a discussion than my other posts that more "stated/listed facts". Investments are something I think we all need to be more aware of when designing activities, and I really like discussing them with you guys.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431770/#Comment_431770" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-28T14:45:02+00:00" title="April 28, 2014  2:45PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I like how my play of thoughts created more of a discussion than my other posts that more "stated/listed facts".</blockquote>I'm beginning to think that EVERY topic should have a functionalist thread and a structuralist thread. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431771/#Comment_431771" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-28T14:53:21+00:00" title="April 28, 2014  2:53PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 28, 2014 3:03PM by Rickard.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Re Robin D Laws player types (and of course we've all seen numerous such taxonomies)...<br/><br/>I'm leery of adhering too closely to taxonomical categories when talking about real things.

I would like to see a game that stated "Play this archetype if you want intrigues in the session" or "Play this role if you want love to always be present".

However games have less variables, effectively limiting the amount of ways anyone can enjoy a game and thus making a taxonomy of players sorta possible. "Sorta" because it won't be perfect given how player's personalities will affect any archetype determined in such taxonomy.<br/><br/>About the different game aspects, well the player's types taxonomy you posted above among some other stuff I readed before made me think of many of them. Allow me to adopt some of these terms by the moment, but correct and replace any of them if you know a better word for them:<br/><br/>The Power Gamer not only enjoys the <b>Competition</b>, there's also the <b>Fantasy of Power</b>. The Butt-Kicker enjoys <b>Destruction</b> and <b>Venting Frustration</b>, but there's also the component of <b>Expecting Consequences</b>, as in curiosity for what will happen if I press the red button.<br/><br/>The tactician also enjoys <b>competition</b>, perhaps  even more than the power gamer (who mostly wants to win) but enjoys it through the<b> Intellectual Challenge</b> I've seen tacticians who also enjoy variant <b>Historical Reconstruction</b>, as in "what could have happened if X went this way instead of that?"<br/>There's <b>Exploration</b>, which mostly happens when the GM is good at framing scenes, creating a feeling of mistery around new places, objects and people. The method actor does enjoy the <b>Expression</b> aspect of the game, however it depends on the acting method: if the player is playing himself as the character then she's going for <b>Showing off</b>, a sorta meta-power fantasy of being the center of attention. If the player is playing the character by going into the very skin of the character and watching the world trou it's eyes, then this is more like Psychological Immersion. Often method actor switch from one method to other to obtain different feelings from the character and the audience.<br/><br/>The storyteller also goes for <b>Expression</b>. Some like to immerse others in a controlled enviroment and thus work through illusionism, railroad or collab (since this can be done either from GM or player's side, I remember we discussed this a long time ago in this forum) Some enjoy and embrace the randomness of the group creation and sandbox the game by roaming free trough improvisation or just built upon the other players input and dice results. Of course all storytellers enjoy a good story above winning all the time or identifying with their characters.<br/><br/>Game design and Rules improvisation are other forms of Expression, even when they are into the meta-gaming side.<br/><br/>Actually I believe the Specialist and the Casual Gamer are less-investing forms of the player types mentioned. Their fun may even come more from aspects outside the game that not even touch the meta. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431814/#Comment_431814" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-29T01:24:50+00:00" title="April 29, 2014  1:24AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 29, 2014 1:38AM by Rickard.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What I meant there is that is harder to make a taxonomy of personalities since the variables are way too many.

The person will always be limited by it's own view of the player type or the game - which you correctly pointed out with my categorization. Someone could say that <b>D&amp;D</b> is Step On Up, but that would only be half the truth and probably say more about the person making that statement rather than the game itself. This is why I'm hesitant to use the WHYs to put labels on games or players. The only reason to use the WHYs in my model is to make an understanding of what's important in your game, or to create new ideas - by combining a WHY with a WHAT - in how to play roleplaying games. This is why I say that people are a combination of all the WHYs, and that's probably true for most roleplaying games too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431839/#Comment_431839" name="Item_126" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-29T11:48:50+00:00" title="April 29, 2014 11:48AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm confused how your diagram is linking to actual emotions?<br/><br/>What I do like is a clear link from gamble, planning and struggle <b>to</b> uncertainty, decision and effort.<br/><br/>Gamble comes down to that uncertain moment.<br/>Planning has to stop at a decision.<br/>Struggle will require effort.<br/><br/>The emotional descriptions? <br/>Is challenge a good emotional description for struggle effort, could it be stress, anger or other ?<br/><br/>I might be off topic but it seems the emotional descriptors could be linked to the investment.  <br/><br/>Investment is a valid term but its like the number zero, it has no value.<br/> <br/>so if you gave it a value you would get the sum of your diagram in the emotions.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432041/#Comment_432041" name="Item_127" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-03T07:11:58+00:00" title="May  3, 2014  7:11AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had to take a few days to think about this.

I can't even make up a word in Swedish for it. It's more a ... mental state(?). They - suspense, tension and challenge - can probably all result in stress, anger, frustration, joy or whatever feeling that you got. It's when something is in the way that these states occur. When you have to choose between two things you can't choose between. When there is something holding you back in your effort.

I will change emotions to one of your suggestions too, or something similar at least. I will use "mood" in this post.\n<blockquote><b>I dunno if "emotions" is a good descriptor of what I'm getting at.

If you want to challenge the player, and not the character, then create a game that takes Effort. What I rebelling against is that some people use the word "no challenge" when there are no obstacles, and obstacles in roleplaying games are simulated by dice rolls, i.e. the locked door. A locked door is a challenge for the character but never for the player, unless the game demands some sort of effort from the player. The only thing the locked door bringsto the player, in form of a dice roll,  is suspense.\n<blockquote><b>Would you say that the investment is zero here or are you thinking of investment being zero in terms of emotions? </b><br/>I was thinking like the character being an empty vessel filling up with a situation and becoming aware of his predicament.<br/>The fisherman becomes aware of the deteriorating weather - he struggles with the simple tasks his tongue pushing out with the effort.<br/>The two arm wrestlers sit down and become aware of the gamble and uncertainty in the faces of fans family/child. <br/><br/>Its like your diagram helps to channel the flow of energy the investment could be <b>awareness</b>? becoming aware of what's at stake.</blockquote>\nWhen I reread this over and over, I got this weird feeling in my stomach as if I discovered something. I like this. I like this a lot. Investment creates awareness. I will take that with me, for sure.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The HOWs - uncertainty, effort, decision (and investment) - are something I've come up with from analyzing games and activities, and through discussion with other game designers. They are all there in an activity, but the game designer can basically concentrate one or two more than the others in their game. The moods suspense, tension and challenge are a minor part of the HOWs, and I'm uncertain if I should even include them in the whole model of WHYs, HOWs and WHATs. I also feel that the moods are there as an explanation of a mental model of mine (a perspective/interpretation of game elements) and they are so theoretical, and not based on anything empirical/scientific, that I feel that I need to do some research about emotions in gaming to have a ground to stand on. At least, when it comes to the rest of the model, I can show other peoples' ideas and say "See, they got it too" but I can't do that with the moods.<br/><br/>I will probably attack this problem by reading <a href="http://janemcgonigal.com/2014/01/06/superbetter-show-me-the-science/" rel="nofollow">the following articles</a> by Jane McGonigal, but it's such a small part of the whole model, and such an amount to read, that I feel I could spend my time in better ways. I still got articles and essays to read about what engages us in games, and I will prioritize that more. But I will come back to the moods in the future when I got more meat on my bones.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432067/#Comment_432067" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-04T06:54:06+00:00" title="May  4, 2014  6:54AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 9, 2014 7:38PM by Rickard.">edited September 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A different topic now.

He tells me that he can't improvise, and have therefor to plan everything. It's important in improv not to plan ahead. To plan ahead is to block yourself into taking other's ideas into consideration. What would happen if someone does something that destroys your plans? Would that make you perplexed? You can probably work around this problem most of the times and some have even put this into structure as how they prepare a scenario.<br/><br/>To spend hours to prepare creates a comfort zone, much as following rules. To throw out the idea of planning isn't really about removing something from how you do things - to destroy a structure that you use - in favor of free improvisation. <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/420773#Comment_420773" rel="nofollow">Like I said before</a>, there is no such thing as improvisation\xa0(paidia). Only unspoken rules. So when someone says "No planning", it actually means to follow a different structure that responds on other's contributions rather than planning ahead to create situations, or a sensation, for others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432288/#Comment_432288" name="Item_131" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-08T07:38:56+00:00" title="May  8, 2014  7:38AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 1, 2014 11:48PM by Rickard.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<h3>Summary</h3>The purpose of this thread is to seeing the similarities from other mediums and, through that perspective, learn more about our own hobby. In the same matter, we need to spot what we nowadays implies through our design (ex. "A game master should balance the game to make the players finally succeed") and to keep remembering people about those things.  Rules of Play, by Salen and Zimmerman, talks about constitutive rules, meaning two games that may look different share the same structures of play. An example of that is Puerto Rico and Race for the Galaxy. The following below are some similarities with roleplaying games from other mediums.<br/><br/>\u2013 Boredom is the default state. We fight boredom by taking part in an activity.<br/><br/>\u2013 Each participant takes on a role. It may be a character, but it can also be a game master, a storyteller or role like that. (Note to self: Jung's masks comes into mind.)<br/>\u2013 Each and every one that participate in the activity are one part of a closed system.<br/>\u2013 In a perfect world, all participants wants to contribute to the interaction that takes place in the system. You can achieve this by making each participant <i>comfortable</i> in the situation. To make each person feel unique. To make each person feel like they are being listened to. To create spontaneous and creative participants. To make them be flexible to the situation and also free to express themselves and their emotions.<br/>\u2013  When interaction happens in a system, a result will emerge.<br/>\u2013 The interaction is nothing more than communication. When the participants talk or discuss, it's as much communication as if they are using the game mechanics.<br/>\u2013 Communication mutate in a natural way in order to keep it interesting.<br/>\u2013 Communication is not about talking, but about listening. About being aware of the surrounding.<br/>\u2013 When a participant controls a certain component of the game, and gets feedback from the surroundings, immersion will appear. Immersion depends on what component the participant controls.<br/><br/>\u2013 A system consist of several, but not necessary all, of the following components: meaning, fiction, setting, group, and structures (WHATs).<br/>\u2013 The communication, the interaction, between them happens through the structures of the game (mechanics and techniques).<br/>\u2013 Structures comes in pools, procedures, and triggers. They are often mixed in each other.<br/>\u2013 Relying on structures gives <i>comfort</i>. Improvising is nothing more than using unsaid structures.<br/><br/>\u2013 A system should make the reader understand it's purpose (WHY).<br/>\u2013 A system should be clear of what components to be used (WHAT).<br/>\u2013 More importantly, the system should teach how to use these components (HOW).<br/>\u2013 A system should have uncertainty to create curiosity to move on or suspense on what to encounter. Breaking a routine is one example of how to keep up the interest.<br/>\u2013 A system should take effort. It should make each participant want to participate; to invest in it.  The very basics of this means creating a positive group relationship where everybody feels <i>comfortable</i>.<br/>\u2013 A system should have decisions. Decision-making is interactivity.<br/>\u2013 A system should reincorporate to create a limit in where the participants can move. Can also be used to create a sense of when things are going to end.<br/>\u2013 A system should provide feedback; to reinforce. Examples may be: getting emotions from doing a task, getting praise from others, or getting a result through interaction between different parts (emergence).<br/><br/>\u2013 A game is a learning process.<br/>\u2013 Fun is the emotional response of learning.<br/>\u2013 Immersion comes from a constant loop between learning the response and adopting to it.<br/><br/>To fail is never bad if you learn from it. This is why I prefer "No, because" (as compared to "No, and/but") as a failing forward mechanic. "No, you couldn't lock pick the door <i>because </i> guards arrives before you can attend to it". The player fails but get a chance to adopt to the new information that is given.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432289/#Comment_432289" name="Item_132" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-08T07:42:09+00:00" title="May  8, 2014  7:42AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2014 3:44AM by Rickard.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the last three-point-list in the previous post is really important, but so also the fact that we always take upon a role when we do an activity. I named this "character" previously but changed the term to the more vague "role". What happens when we immerse in the activity is similar to flow: loss of time, feeling energized, we become one with the task, and we enjoy doing the activity. The default meaning of "immersion" in roleplaying game is to lose yourself in the character, but because role is something we always take upon, there is more to it. It's instead about taking on a perspective; a sense of meaning in life.<br/><br/>A role is something you take on, and immersion is what you want from playing a game. But you can be immersed in more ways than just meaning.<br/><br/>I've been playing with character focus (immersed in meaning) most of my life and, when I stumbled upon Forge games, I had a hard time to understand how to take them on. I had a hard time understanding how to think to enjoy them and it took a couple of years before I realized that those games were instead more about creating fiction with others. It was what kept me in the hobby today, because I was getting tired of my old play style. The last few years, I've come upon world building games like <b>MicroScope</b>, <b>The Quiet Year</b> and <a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2011/12/16/a-thousand-years-under-the-sun/" rel="nofollow">A Thousand Days Under the Sun</a>. I'm not fully enjoying those games but I think that's because that I haven't realized how to think - in what mental state of mind I have to put myself into - to benefit from the gaming experience.<br/><br/>I want to relearn the hobby as a game designer by going back to the basics. I will do that so I can discover what we taken for granted and forgotten to explain to thers, or discover new ways in how to play roleplaying games and then explain them to others in how to design them.

What's important to understand is that, for a game at least, the participants and the activity are each a specific combination of all the WHYs and the activity is also a combination of all the HOWs. What a game designer can do is to focus more on some of those to make one game differ from another. Even with the same play structure, Monopoly will change a lot if you focus on Competition compared to if you focus on Expression.<br/><br/><b>WHY we play</b><blockquote><i>Expression</i>: to show who you are as a gamer. To take on a role. To be creative. Communication and agreement.<br/><i>Sensation</i>: to experience something. To escape from reality. To get an insight or to live out a different perspective.<br/><i>Exploration</i>: to discover and learn different aspects of the game or emergence created through the interaction between the different parts.<br/><i>Competition</i>: to beat others or the game in different aspects of the game.<br/><i>Destruction</i>: to destroy what's created. To render something useless, like finding loop holes in the rule system to make yourself unbeatable.</blockquote>Combine a WHY with a WHAT to gain completely different gaming experiences. This could mean that you got 25 different playstyles, but even if you settle for Expression+Fiction, there are multiple ways of make this combination differ. What Expression+Fiction really means is how the loop between the role and the WHAT is handled. This is the loop that creates immersion in the WHAT. Will the participant, through the role, express the role's perspective and get a response back? What would happen if it's instead a competition between the participants about who controls the fiction?<br/><br/><b>HOW we play</b><blockquote><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/422288#Comment_422288" rel="nofollow"><i>Investment</i></a>:  investment is something that's created through time or put at stake at the beginning. To create something of your own is a greater investment than be given something. Investment isn't really part of the HOWs, but by combining investment with any other HOW creates the following below.<br/><br/><i>Gamble </i>= investment + <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/422143#Comment_422143" rel="nofollow">uncertainty</a>: the joy in suspense. To be able to put things at stake and risking loosing it while trying to gaining something else.<br/><i>Planning </i>= investment + <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/422235#Comment_422235" rel="nofollow">decision</a>: feeling the tension from having to do decisions. Decision-making is also what creates interactivity.<br/><i>Struggle </i>= investment + <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/422196#Comment_422196" rel="nofollow">effort</a>: if you don't have any opposition, you would loose interest after a while. It's about participation instead of observation.</blockquote>HOW is a strange gem and it's what binds WHY and WHAT together in a way. In MDA, it's the dynamics that ties mechanics and aesthetics together and HOW fills the same purpose. There are heaps of ways in how to use each HOW, which can be found in the links above. Just like WHY, all HOWs are present in a game but in various degrees. If there are any other activities, like taking a walk, some HOWs wont hardly be present at all. There is almost no uncertainty that you wont be able to finish the walk and the tiny obstacles that can do that wont create a suspense. If you however compete with someone else, both effort and uncertainty will be present.<br/><br/><b>WHAT we play with</b><blockquote><i>Meaning</i>: spiritual, philosophical, ethical, social and cultural perspectives of life. It's something that the game provides or the character provides.<br/><i>Fiction</i>: the story produced by playing. Note that to be able to learn something, we tend to create fiction to be able to understand it easier.<br/><i>Structures</i>: game mechanics and techniques sorted into pools, procedures and triggers. The structure of how the game or the participants should communicate with each other.<br/><i>Group</i>: the participants taking part in the activity. According to research by Nicole Lazzarro, emotions produced by games are increased a lot by doing something together compared to playing alone.<br/><i>Setting</i>: where the play takes place or where the story being told. Also involved all the characters.</blockquote>This is what the player is given to handle during a game. A game is nothing without it's participants so they should always be considered to be parts of the game itself. It's my observation that many game designers forget about this and only focuses on what the game should do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433056/#Comment_433056" name="Item_134" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-27T08:42:04+00:00" title="May 27, 2014  8:42AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 8, 2014 3:04PM by Rickard.">edited September 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [edit] I realized that WHY is actually Aesthetics and WHAT is Mechanics in MDA (corresponding to Surface and Structure in Understanding Comics). A thanks to Bart Stewart for pointing that out.\n<h5>WHY, HOW, WHAT</h5>According to flow theory, you achieve flow by doing a task, but you have to want to do the task in the first place. It sounds so obvious that it seems stupid to point it out but it's more important than people may think. I'm a firm believer that not all people should play all games, but instead playing the games that they think is fun. To be able to attract the right consumer, the game must first convey the WHY so the player type corresponds to the playstyle that the game have. Simon Sinek talks about this in Start With Why. Apple's vision is to  challenge the status quo. They do it through intricate and innovative design. They just happens to make computers. You have an Apple because you share their vision, and not entirely because of what they produce. It's a pride to some to own an Apple. You own it because that will tell others about who you are as a person: someone who challenges the status quo.<br/><br/>My conclusion from reading that book is that we should do the same with games. If you ever read a game pitch that start with how many classes and spells it got, that's starting with WHAT. A game description could say that it's about strategy and betrayal, and that's a HOW. "Do you want to be on top of the food chain?", now that's a WHY. Which pitch appealed more to you?<br/><br/>Scott McCloud says in Understanding Comics that the creator starts with Structure (WHAT), goes on with Craft (HOW) and finish off with Surface (WHY) but the consumer takes in the art from the other way: Surface-&gt;Craft-&gt;Structure. Marc LeBLanc's MDA says something similar, while a game designer can start with any step, the gamer will experience first Aesthetics (WHY), then Dynamics (HOW), and finally Mechanics (WHAT).\n<h5>Immersion is the result we're after</h5>\nIn order to attain presence (spatial immersion), you have to do a loop between the role you take and the game world. To be able to gain flow, you will do a task and get constant feedback. If you want immersion, it will be a constant loop between the player's self-awareness about the character and the response from the game world. The skill atom claims the same thing, that a loop is happening. Each time you will have to update your own thinking. Each time you get a response, you will learn something from this loop. And what is an emotional response to learning..?<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://erebaltor.se/rickard/utmaning_immersion.png"/><br/>When playing a game, you will take on a role and that role will come with a WHAT. The HOW then creates the dynamic between that WHAT and the game world. The game world isn't exactly a world per se but can also be a game board, a discussion or possibly even a theme. I don't know what to call all this, where the interaction takes place, but "game world" suits the purpose at the moment. When you implement your WHAT through HOW into the game world, the response it will give is a WHY. In other words, the response can give you a <i>sensation</i>, give the feeling of <i>competition</i>, enhance your love for <i>destruction</i>, or a combination of those.<br/><br/>While doing this loop of feedbacks, you will become more and more invested: you will bond with your task. Getting a feedback is also learning and the brain's response to learning is the release of dopamins\u2014liquid fun. This is why we play games, but it may differ WHY we think it's fun. What we're after when playing is immersion, flow, being the zone, being invested in, or whatever you want to call it. The loop will constantly give you more dopamins.<br/><br/>One of my purposes of writing in this thread is to discover new ways of playing. Make what I have written about into a play of thought, just as I do. Take any WHY and combine it with any WHAT. What would that look like? Competition + group, can that be a debate? Are there any HOW that you want to explore, what kind of WHAT is suited for it and what WHY could be the response to it? If you then changed the WHY, would that affect how you look at the already picked WHAT and HOW?<br/><br/>This model has helped me discover new ways of playing. It will help me as a game designer to explore new areas in our hobby, and all I can hope is that it can do the same thing for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433357/#Comment_433357" name="Item_135" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-04T03:57:09+00:00" title="June  4, 2014  3:57AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Focused Play = Total Fun</b><br/>When I say that you should only play the game that suits you\u2014that suits your WHY\u2014I also think that you should design in the same way.

It's not. Over the last year when I tried this out in narrating, I realized breaking routines is about change. When something is coming to it's end, it's over and will loose it's interest. If I instead describe a place like "Trees in a row. Footsteps from someone lonely. An owl is watching. A smile appears when two people meeting. A scent of roses.", I constantly breaking the routines. If I would had continued describing who made those footsteps, the interest of reading it would diminish.<br/><br/>Johnstone also talks about this when it comes to status. There are three ways of achieving status; high status through forced dominance (the teacher everyone were afraid of); low status by leaving room for others; high status by adopting to others though constant <i>change</i> between high and low status. In similarity, the same thing can happen in a play. The evil monarch and the beggar will switch places during play, which will keep up the interest for the audience in what's happening.<br/><br/>In roleplaying games, there is usually rules for improvement, but getting better is only a subcategory to change. We don't need improvement rules in roleplaying games, but we need the characters, or story, to constantly change. Something I did the last years of playing only trad, was to think of how my character would change personality over time, and play against that. <b>FATE </b>got <i>both</i> change through keys and improvement, and I think that's just cake on cake. I love cake, but sometimes it can be too much.<br/><br/>An <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/FifthColumnGames/war-of-omens" rel="nofollow">online CCG</a> I'm currently playing - a card game that is very well thought through - has four different factions with different cards, but what I really enjoy is that the factions doesn't play out in the same way. So it's not only different cards, they <i>feel</i> different to play, much like the design of the colors in Magic gives a different feel. So when I get tired of playing the game, I just switch to another faction to get a different experience.<br/><br/>Nicole Lazzaro talks in her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMsrVanw2Ss&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=1187" rel="nofollow">four keys of fun</a>, about how a game can manage to enjoy someone by only having a loop in of the keys (recognize this?). I did talk about focused play in my previous post, but what she also suggest is to create a change in what to enjoy by having the different keys loop into each other. So you can, for example, have <i>people fun</i>, where it's about enjoying the company of other people, turn into <i>hard fun</i>, where the group is trying to beat something. I did this in a tactical RPG of mine, where one of my design goals were to make people discuss tactic. I managed to achieve this fairly easy by letting each power for every character to be used on anyone. So to be able to use the powers in the best way possible (hard fun), the group needed to discuss (people fun) how to distribute the use of the powers.<br/><br/>(Note that she mostly talks about changing between different loops in the matter of attracting as many people as possible to do the activity, and in terms of gamification. I'm not fully sold on either idea, but I think she has otherwise some sane ideas to take into consideration.)<br/><br/>When I talk about the loops above, and how they create immersion/investment/flow, it's important to realize the change that occurs when the player get a response and adopt to it, and how important that change is to keep up the interest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434011/#Comment_434011" name="Item_139" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-18T09:22:42+00:00" title="June 18, 2014  9:22AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just an observation that doesn't really fit anywhere else...  <br/><br/>If we go with Bernard Suits' definition - "Playing a game is a voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles" - we can find evidence that humans aren't the only creatures who do this.

They also show social tendencies, can cooperate to get food, and even take in behavior from other species, like looking where a human is looking.<br/><br/>Social behavior is also mostly learned through interaction but also through play, like the cubs wrestling each other.

It's not that I'm a huge fan of improv, which is an art I surely enjoy experiencing, but because the book contains a lot of basic foundations in how we communicate with each other. To design a roleplaying game is to design a conversation. It doesn't matter if you got game mechanics, using techniques, or only have a structure of play. They all share the same purpose, to make people interact with either the game itself or with each other.<br/><br/>I'm now going to quote from Impro and give my interpretation of why I think that text is so important for roleplaying games. It's going to be a lot of text, so I will break it down into four chapters: notes about myself, status, spontaneity, and narrating with theater. These are four chapters from the book. I will translate back from Swedish into English so some terms will change. I should also say that the page numbers may be wrong too, compared to the English book.<br/><br/>NOTES ABOUT MYSELF<br/>When a book has interesting stuff as early as in the introduction, I know it's going to be a good book.<br/><br/>p. 13When I grew up, the world started to become gray and boring. /.../ I thought a diminish of perception came with age /.../ I didn't realize, that the ability to experience clear and intensive is a matter of mind. Since then, I've discovered techniques to make the world rise in flames again on fifteen seconds with effects that lasts for hours.<br/>He then goes into describing an exercise where the people in the group goes around and saying out loud the wrong names on objects in the surroundings. About ten names will do. Johnstone states the effects are, among other things, making the colors brighter, the people smaller and the counters sharper. What happens is that our brain sorts out visual sense, our strongest one of all the (20+) senses we got, all the time. We stray through the day noticing things unconsciously, but by breaking the conceptions about what you have in your surroundings, you can force the brain to become more aware of the situation. A similar related effect can happen if you shout out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scH0R1pl4jM" rel="nofollow">name of the object</a>.<br/><br/>So why is it important to be aware of the surroundings? Because you become more aware of your <i>friends</i>, of how they react, of how they think, of what they contribute with. Even if you're not looking right at them, you can sense their feelings, and adopt to it. I think this is one step in achieving group flow; where the whole group are in synergy and inspire each other. You know those times when you brainstormed, or had a lively discussion, and the whole world disappeared around you? That were the moments when you had group flow.<br/><br/>p. 27As Edward Bond said: "The community of authors taught me that dramatic is about relations and not characters."<br/>The quote is taken from it's context, but when I read this I instantly thought of my <a href="http://www.gnomestew.com/gming-advice/the-fish-tank-as-a-mystery-2/" rel="nofollow">fish tank</a>. It's a scenario writing technique for creating mysteries, and the clues that should be given to the players are the relations between the different factions nor the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" rel="nofollow">MacGuffins</a>. A place is seldom interesting without a relation to something else, like being the camp for raiders or a reminder of the great battle that occurred. The relations should be thought of when it comes to everything, even the personal characters in roleplaying games. A relation to the scenario is normally created in-game through a mysterious stranger in the corner of a tavern, but there are lots of other ways in how to incorporate this.<br/><br/>p. 29-30Soon we were a significant troupe and the only improv group I knew of. /.../ It was horrifying to wake up in the morning, only to know that you will stand on a stage in twelve hours without being able to prepare for success. /.../ ...if you're lucky, the flow wont be broken /.../ Other days, cold stare will meet you /.../ After some time, a pattern started to take form and the performance gradually improved, up to a point where the audience becomes like an animal that turns over to be scratched.  /.../ Hubris grabs you ... /.../ ... you <i>expect </i>to be loved ... /.../ All comedians know this feeling.<br/><br/>When I came to realize these techniques, that releases the improviser's creativity, I started to use them in my own work.<br/>That last sentence. I have already said that there is no such thing as improvisation. There is no such things as paidia\u2014free imagining without any rules. The only thing improvisation is, is the use of unspoken rules. So even if you improvise, you use techniques to inspire you and to release creativity. Gnome Stew is releasing a <a href="http://www.enginepublishing.com/unframed-the-art-of-improvisation-for-game-masters" rel="nofollow">book about improvisation</a>, and from what I can tell from the preview, it's a book that teaches you techniques to use in different situations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434163/#Comment_434163" name="Item_142" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-21T18:38:58+00:00" title="June 21, 2014  6:38PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 13, 2014 12:30PM by Rickard.">edited September 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Still hungover from yesterday's Midsummer Eve so my English might be even crappier than usual.<br/><br/>STATUS<br/>p. 42If status is something common, what is it then that happens between friends? Many would claim that we don't play status games with our friends and still every moment, every intonation, is status. My answer is that acquaintances becomes friends <i>when they agree</i> that they play status games with each other. If I serve an acquaintance a cup of tea one early morning, then perhaps I would say "Slept well?" or something similarly "neutral" and status is established through voice, posture, eye contact and so on. If I serve a friend a cup of tea, then I can say "Get up, you old cow!", or "The duchess's tea!" and pretend I raise or lower my status. When the students understand that they play status games with their friends, they also realize that they already know the most of the status games I'm trying to teach them.<br/>Usually we got a social hierarchy within the gaming group, even if you play with strangers on conventions. The person who explains the rules will automatically raise their status towards the rest in the group. I think this is really important to realize when you play collaborative storytelling, and  I myself usually joke about myself to lower my status after or during the explanation of how to play the game. There are tons of other ways to do this: you can make others look cool or taking on roles that got a really low status for example.<br/><br/>If you want creative players, whether you play collaborative storytelling or traditional gaming, then make them comfortable. Raising their status is one way of achieving this feeling.<br/><br/>p. 51When status becomes automatic, like it is in real life, then it becomes possible to improvise complex scenes with any preparation /.../ This is not that far way from Stanislavsky [creator of method acting, my comment] as some may think, despite the fact that Stanislavsky wrote in An Actor Prepares(?): "Play out the outer task." /.../<br/><br/>Some "method actors" interpret this in a way that they must know all "given circumstances" before they can improvise. If I ask them to do something spontaneous, they will react as if I asked them to do something indecent. /.../ All you need to know when you enter a room, is what kind of status you have.<br/>I wish some roleplaying games experimented with different kinds of scene framing, where we play to find out where we are. I fantasize sometimes about playing out a full conversation about something ordinary, like taking the kids to the zoo, and finish off the scene with "Do you think the holes are deep enough? Ask Peg to drag the bodies here."<br/><br/>p. 58, p. 60If you can make the students insult each other in a playful way, then the status exercises will become easier. /.../ When they do that, the actors becomes absorbed and often impossible to stop. /.../ Teams of, for example, master-servants can meet and insult each other. But there has to be a purpose, something they want to achieve in the scene, except "getting insulted". The sudden drop in status is so drastic as well as pleasurable, that typical status scenes never seems as threatening.<br/>A good exercise, before playing with strangers, to make them relax? Johnstone also suggest writing down a list of insults to incorporate in the normal dialogue so it becomes more apparent that there is no mean, conscientiously as unconsciously, to it.<br/><br/>p. 64-65The movement teacher Yat Malmgren told me, that he as a child discovered that he didn't end where the body ended, but that he really was an oval "Swiss Cheese shape". To me this is the "space" that surrounds you, and that you experience if you close  your eyes and feels with the body outwards, into the surrounding darkness. /.../<br/><br/>"Much like the Earth is surrounded by atmosphere, the living human is surrounded of a magnetic aura, that reaches contact with the outer objects, without having contact with the human body. This aura, or atmosphere, varies in depth, depending on the life force of the human . . ." (The Theatre of Jean-L<br/>ouis Barrault, Barrie and Rockcliff, 1961)<br/>When I read this, I think of the astral lines that are sent out in the movie Donnie Darko. Astral lines, or astral traces, are also talked about in parapsychology. I also think of Cesar Milan - The Dog Whisperer - and how he always talks about sending out "energy" that the dogs can pick up on. Keith Johstone talks about people being like magnets in the space, with iron filings on the floor, and when someone move then the movement will change the iron filings.<br/><br/>But even if it all sounds like magic when he and several others talk about it, he also acknowledge that it's adopting to others through body language, posture and even the tone of the voice. When talking about status, it's about adopting to the "lines" of the others. If I point somewhere, people will (follow that line and) turn to that point. Someone who doesn't want to be seen, someone with low status, will adopt to the lines in the space, or make itself invisible by trying to be so small as possible.<br/><br/>I said earlier that you can raise someone else's status by making them cool. Cesar Milan does this with nervous dogs by raising their tails. Change the body and the mind will follow. This happens with humans as well. It's an effect called \xbbmirror neurons\xab. If you see someone cry, then you may mimic their face and feel their sadness. Play in pairs and raise you head and make the other person do the same thing. The person will feel more confident, as holding the head high signifies pride. You can also raise someone's status by mimic their posture to send a signal that you agree; an effect called \xbbmirroring\xab.<br/><br/>But what I think is really important is the awareness of space and how you can influence it. Lower your status by following "the lines" or raise your status by breaking them.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Something I'm a little surprised over is that I didn't make dog ears on the pages talking about different kinds of status. About the teacher that everybody was afraid of (high status by forced dominance), about those who are submissive (low status), and those who are admired by everyone (by changing between low and high status). Cesar Milan often talks about dominant behavior but if you watch his shows, you will see that he actually switching between both high and low status. If a dog is nervous, then he will first lower his status to gain trust before he enforce assertiveness.<br/><br/>Keith Johnstone also talk about change in status in play, and how the change between servant and master (the jester and the king, etc.), where the master will serve the servant, becomes interesting for the audience. <i>Play Unsafe</i> talks about this but I think it kind of misses the point. "All you need to know when you enter a room, is what kind of status you have." and using status to bring comfort within the group is really what I want to take with me from this chapter. Both these points, and also change of status within the play, are important for improvising but for different ways; one is helping how to (re)act; another to make people comfortable; the third to make things interesting <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/433814#Comment_433814" rel="nofollow">through the change of status</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434222/#Comment_434222" name="Item_143" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-23T09:11:24+00:00" title="June 23, 2014  9:11AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 16, 2014 10:49AM by Rickard.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            SPONTANEITY, part one<br/>There will be longer quotations here because you have to understand the whole chain of thoughts. I will therefor break this chapter into two posts.<br/><br/>p. 85Most schools encourage children to <i>not</i> show creativity and ingenuity. Research has up to this point shown that creative children are disliked by their teachers. Torrance gives an eyewitness of an "exceptional creative boy" who questioned on of the rules in the textbook. "The teacher became furious, even in the presence of the principle. She boiled of anger: 'So! You think you know more than this book!' ..." (E P Torrance, Guiding Creative Talent, Prentice-Hall, 1962)<br/>/.../<br/>One of my students spent two years in a classroom, where the teacher had hung a big sign over the black board. It said "Your attitude should be 'Yes, teacher!'".<br/>The first rule of roleplaying:<br/>1. The game master is always right.<br/>The second rule of roleplaying:<br/>2. If the game master isn't right, see rule no 1.<br/><br/>In the first chapter, Johnstone wrote: "When I grew up, the world started to become gray and boring. /.../ I thought a diminish of perception came with age /.../ I didn't realize, that the ability to experience clear and intensive is a matter of mind.", and it's the same thing with spontaneity. We learn as we grow up to adopt to others\u2014to not stand out. This is a sort of self-censoring that we need to break down in order to become creative in roleplaying games.<br/><br/>When I read about the teacher and how she treated the creative boy, I remember a conversation I had with a game master that were so annoyed when the players didn't do what he expected. This, and rule 1 and 2, is an attitude that chokes creativity in roleplaying games.<br/><br/>I usually say that to be able to play <b>This Is Pulp</b> or <b>InSpectres</b>, with me as a game master, it takes experienced roleplaying gamers 20 minutes and non-gamers 10 minutes to understand how to play the games. This is because I have to break down and rebuild the attitude that the experienced roleplayers have, in order to make them more creative and spontaneous.<br/><br/>p. 90-91It may seem like humans aren't that creative, but they are extremely ingenious when it comes to rationalize their own actions. /.../ A friend of mine got discovered buck naked in a closet, of a furious husband. The wife screamed: "I have never seen that man before in my life!" "I must be on the wrong floor", said my friend. None of these explanations are satisfactory, /.../ but they came automatically.<br/><br/>Sometimes I shock my students that has be taught by extremely orthodox "method" teachers.<br/>"Be sad", I say.<br/>"What do you mean, be sad?"<br/>"Just be said. See what happens."<br/>"But what is my motivation?"<br/>/.../<br/>"That's not in particular sad. You're only pretending."<br/>"But you asked to me pretend."<br/>"Raise one arm. Well, why did you raise it?"<br/>"Because you asked me."<br/>"Yes, but why would you had raised it?"<br/>"To get a hold of a strap, on the subway."<br/>Say the first thing that comes into mind, because that is usually the best idea. I would never had thought of a subway as a reason of why I raised my hand. Don't hesitate, that's what being spontaneous is about. Thinking that it's too ordinary? Obviously not. Your own thoughts are ordinary to you, but they will almost always seem unique to me. Even if they aren't unique, it's what I will expect, and you fulfilling that expectation can also be a good thing. I will talk more about this in the next chapter called Narrating With Theater.<br/><br/>p. 103"There are humans that prefer to say "Yes and there are humans that prefer to say "No". Those who says "Yes will be rewarded through the experience of adventures, and those who says "No" are rewarded through the safety and comfort that they achieve. There are a lot more "Naysayers" than "Yeasayers", but you can train one to be another. ("Yeasayers and Naysayers", Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, Vol 160, No 2, 1960.)<br/>/.../<br/>There is a connection here to status play, because low status players tend to accept and high status players tend to block. They block every transaction, if they feel that they can't control it.<br/>What does "rolling the die" means? What does it mean to have a game master with unlimited power? What does it mean to have game mechanics, that the game master can enforce, to limits what the players can do?<br/><br/>When I playtested <b>The Murder of Mr. Crow</b>, a game where you aren't allowed to say "no", some people said that they wanted to sometimes be able to say "no". If we assume that the game has a working rule set for interacting with each other, what does that tell you about them?<br/><br/>It's my belief that the game master needs to let go and start accepting the other participants' ideas. I'm not saying that we should get rid of the rule mechanics, because that will leave the game master empty handed, but what I have been talking about all through this thread is the use of structures in play. Structures can come in form of game mechanics or techniques. I also been talking about how there is no such thing as improvisation but instead the use of (unspoken) structures. Thirdly, I also mentioned that the structures are there to make people communicate\u2014to make them interact with each other.<br/><br/>So try to create an interaction through saying "Yes", by taking what others have contributed with and give it a spin. Also, when someone feel that they are acknowledged, then they will feel good about themselves. So what this means is not only a fruitful interaction model that frees spontaneity and creativity but also a reward system. And if I say something, you reply, and I adopt to it and reply, then we got this circular feedback system that brings both investment and immersion/presence/flow.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Why I'm quoting from this book isn't because it's a sort of Bible that everyone should listen to, but because here are ideas that I had for the last five years about roleplaying games. What Keith Johnstone writes corresponds so perfectly with my own ideas, that he's actually verbalizing them.<br/><br/>The next part will be about blocking and accepting, and the huge difference between "Yes, but" in roleplaying games and improv, even though roleplaying gamers got that technique from improvisation theater in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434407/#Comment_434407" name="Item_144" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-26T08:13:42+00:00" title="June 26, 2014  8:13AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 6, 2014 9:15PM by Rickard.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are some contradictions in what I wrote above.<br/><br/>People are afraid to stand out, but they also want to provide original ideas. The original ideas are often the dull ones, because the ordinary ideas are something everybody can give a response to. If I explained Hitlers return through a metaphysical aspect that involved the Illuminati, I would exclude a lot of people from adding ideas to it, compared to if I said "Hitler fled". How did Hitler flee? That's up to you to add.<br/><br/>I and <a href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">@Hasimir</a> talked about the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19000/dreamwake-the-importance-of-saying-no/p1" rel="nofollow">the power of saying no</a> a few months back. While it may seem like I despise the use of "no", it can come in handy sometimes. Hasimir talked about his veto rule and how it was used to make people be on the same wave length. If someone didn't like what another participant contributed with, that person could use the veto and then explain why the rule was used. The first person could then adopt to it and change it's contribution. (Again with the loop.)<br/><br/>I've noticed how "Yes, but" can bring comfort when I game master <b>InSpectres</b> or <b>This Is Pulp</b>. Not so much for me, but for my players when I say that they can invent anything in the environment as long as they leave room for me to fill in with "Yes, but". If I don't introduce "Yes, but"\u2014a technique that can negate what they came up with\u2014it can otherwise leave the players uncertain in what they can fill out the environment with.<br/><br/>Another thing that brings comfort in playing is the use of the X card. If we're about to play a game on conventions that are about sensitive topics, we always introduce the X card. Whenever someone feels unease of what occurs in the scene, that person can take the X card to end the scene. No questions asked, and another scene is framed instead. I have never seen the X card been used in play, but I think that's because it brings comfort having it. The player know that the scene can always end at any moment, and is therefor in control over the situation.<br/><br/>And <i>control </i> is what "no" is about.

Some people will say "no..." (implied ellipsis) if they feel something suggested was technically accurate but aesthetically wrong or illogical for a given character or location (in other words, saying "no" in this case is more like defending a mood/theme/stylistic choice, editing for continuity, or pointing out a narrative gaffe; If the gaffe can be corrected without destroying the whole suggestion, then someone usually proposes an alternate pretty quickly.  That suggestion often comes from a player who isn't involved directly in the scene.)  In other words, sometimes "no" means "not quite exactly", which is effectively similar to a "yes but".<br/><br/>This is a picayune point in most cases, but when the call precedes the fiction it can be an important distinction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434418/#Comment_434418" name="Item_146" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-26T09:13:22+00:00" title="June 26, 2014  9:13AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2014 9:20AM by Rickard.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>In other words, sometimes "no" means "not quite exactly", which is effectively similar to a "yes but".</blockquote>\nYeah, I forgot to say that in the post, but a "Yes, but" is the same thing to me as a somewhat good way of using "No".

I say that because if I let two students act out a scene, where they have to say "I love you" to each other, they always almost accept each others ideas.<br/>It's important to help the group to be in the right state of mind. If the players are competitive, or think that it's the game master versus the players, blocking will occur as a natural response to all kinds of interaction.<br/><br/>p. 108-109I call everything that an actor does for "offering". An offer can either be accepted or blocked. /.../ Blocking is anything that hinders the story to develop, or rendering the possibilities useless that the partner has earlier established. If it contribute to the story, then it's not blocking.<br/><br/>"Are your name Smith?"<br/>"And what if it were, you disgusting creep!"<br/><br/>This is not blocking, even if the answer is hostile. Another example:<br/><br/>"I had enough of your incompetence, Perkins! Please leave!"<br/>"No, Sir"<br/><br/>/.../ The other one, who talks, has accepted that he is a servant, and he has accepted the situation,<br/><br/>I talked earlier about the word "No" but what's important is what the word usually leads to: blocking. This is what I mean when I said that "Yes, but" is a good version of "No". I will restrict what the other person is saying but it will hopefully lead to something else. In the same matter, when I used "Yes/No...and/but" systems, I never used "No...and/but". I preferred to instead use "No, because" so I could provide more information to create a new situation that could be solved. That's not blocking by using "No", that's offering a new situation.<br/><br/>p. 112These "offer-blocking-accepting" exercises are useful outside the acting career. People who live a dull and boring life thinks their lives has become like that by chance. In reality, all people choose, more or less, what kind of events that they will experience, through their conscious patterns of blocking and submission. One student objected to this idea and said "But you don't choose your life. Sometimes, you're in the hands of people who demands and controls." I said: "Are you avoiding those people?" "Oh", he said. "I understand what you mean."<br/>A word of wisdom, according to me. I noticed this as well. People that had bad things happening in their lives will continue to have bad things happening to them,  but that's because they don't dare to choose paths other than wrong ones. I've seen my fair share of people who finally got into a good relationship or any other kind of healthy life, but screwed it up because they didn't think that they deserved it.<br/><br/>(I do wonder there is a mistranslation in "conscious" from English to Swedish because I would say it's an unconscious pattern. It's possible that it's a \xbbconsciousness\xab that Johnstone is talking about, because that's the word that is used everywhere else. "...through their patterns of the consciousness..." That word assumes both the conscious and unconscious mind.)<br/><br/>p. 115<b>"Yes, but . . ."</b><br/>This is a well known "accept-and-block" exercise. /.../ I will describe it because there are two ways of doing it, that gives opposite results\u2014and it says something about the nature of spontaneity. /.../ If you do this exercise in a bad way, B will come up with the answer <i>before</i> he starts to talk.<br/>"Excuse me, is that your dog?"<br/>Yes, but I'm thinking of selling him."<br/>"Do you want to sell him to me?"<br/>"Yes, but he's expensive.<br/>"Is he healthy?"<br/>Yes, but you can take him to the vet and give him an exam."<br/>/.../<br/>...the actors has probably not that fun on stage. This because it's the logical and rational part of the consciousness that is in control. If you instead answer "Yes, but..." with enthusiasm, /.../ and answers the fist anything that appears in the consciousness, the answers will be different. /.../<br/><br/>"Do I know you?"<br/>"Yes, but I have to go."<br/>"You took my money!"<br/>"Yeah, but I've spent them all."<br/>"You're a bastard!"<br/>"Yes, but everyone knows that."<br/>/.../<br/>It's /.../ very funny to throw yourself out with "Yes, but..." and <i>have to</i> end the sentence on the spot.<br/><br/>What he talks about is basically to have the right state of mind, but also to force yourself to answer the first thing that comes into mind. To avoid self-censoring yourself.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The last one is a long quote, but I want to show the difference in attitude in how "Yes, but" is handled in improv compared to roleplaying games. I feel that "Yes, but" in roleplaying games are used to create an obstacle, pretty much as in the first example. The second part is accepting what has been said and giving it a spin, even though it's blocking.<br/><br/>To create obstacles in roleplaying games is an attitude that I think hurts the collaborative experience in roleplaying games. It's what make the game to become the game master versus the players. We are so damn focused on using conflicts in attempt to create uncertainty, that we haven't thought of what it really does to our games. Some games thrive on having the game master as the adversary, and that's fine, but not all games need to be like that.<br/><br/>I believe that <b>ALL Forge games</b> suffers from this, and I think it's because the roleplaying game theorists/designers have played traditional roleplaying games and brought over a lot of stuff to their designs without thinking of what it actually does. They thought that conflicts were something that needed to be included in a game to make it interesting. In <a href="http://erebaltor.se/rickard/TheMurderofMrCrow_RickardElimaa.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Murder of Mr Crow</a>, there is no conflict between the participants. There is no way of saying "No". What I used instead was social contingency from the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/422143#Comment_422143" rel="nofollow">large list of uncertainties</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434507/#Comment_434507" name="Item_148" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-28T06:42:51+00:00" title="June 28, 2014  6:42AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 27, 2014 2:31AM by Rickard.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another major difference between roleplaying games and improv is the use of "Yes, and". In improv, it's used by another participant to accept another person's contribution, and give it a spin. This is acknowledgment, which gives an (social) intrinsic reward, as I have mentioned earlier. In roleplaying games, <i>it's the same person</i> that does both the description of the action and provide the additional information. This is, to me, a form of violation towards the Czege principle, even though the principle is stated in a somewhat weird way: "if the same person generates the adversity and also its resolution in an RPG, the result is boring." (<a href="http://random-average.com/TheoryTopics/CzegePrinciple" rel="nofollow">source</a>)<br/><br/>The important meaning in the Czege principle is that one player should not respond to it's own action, but instead let another person respond to it. That's what interaction is. Without interaction, the game becomes "boring". "Yes, and" is all about this in improv, but the use of that phrase has lost it's original purpose in roleplaying games.<br/><br/>If the same person do an action and responds to it with an "and", that is responding to it's own action. This actually happen in a similar way when someone else has to respond with "No, and". Sure, that person says "No" and explaining why\u2014which is a good thing because that person is answering someone else\u2014but what then happens is that the same person, who did the explanation of why the action didn't succeed, then do an "and" and responds to their own description.<br/><br/>(And why is the Czege principle phrased like it is? Well, reread the last two paragraphs in the previous post.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434960/#Comment_434960" name="Item_149" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-07T16:48:24+00:00" title="July  7, 2014  4:48PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 27, 2014 2:32AM by Rickard.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            NARRATING WITH THEATER, part 1<br/>The post was too long, so I had to break this chapter into smaller bits.<br/><br/>p. 124I decided that the implication should be ignored. /.../ I tell the improvisers to follow the rules and see what happens and never feel singled out from what comes out of it. If you improvise in a spontaneous matter, you have to accept that your inner self will be revealed. /.../<br/><br/>Alex Comfort filmed my work once, /.../ He had just explained that I worked as a therapist, that I drew the students out to areas that were normally "forbidden" and that spontaneity were about abandoning your defenses.<br/>Self-censoring again. This time it's not so much about wanting to fit in and having good ideas. It's instead of the fear of what others can interpret. I remember a session that I game mastered with non-gamers (with "non-gamers", I mean no experience in roleplaying games). It's a game that is all about being creative and it takes around 1,5 hours to play, including adventure writing, explaining the rules, making characters and all of that. One participant said that she had a hard time making things up, but I reassured her that it wouldn't be a problem.<br/><br/>It was. The game took almost twice the time to play, because she constantly self-censored herself so whenever it were her turn to contribute, the whole game halted because she couldn't come up with anything. In retro-perspective, I thought first that I should had stopped the game and done some exercises to release spontaneity and creativity. While this may had helped, I think it was something I did in the prep phase of the game. To start off the game, the participants draw things on a map, and she drew a mountain. It looked like a dick, which I jokingly insinuated, and it got even worse when someone drew a stick figure standing on it's snow-covered peak.<br/><br/>I do think that humors is great to relieve tension but in this case, I brought out her implication in the open, thus making her more anxious for what else that could had come out of her while we were playing. She then over-thought her contributions in attempt to self-censor herself. Self-censoring is an attitude that hurts creativity.<br/><br/>p. 125-126When you decided to ignore the implication, it's possible to understand exactly what a narrating progression is, because you can concentrate on the <i>structure</i>. /.../ Even the smallest child knows that a story isn't a sequence of events.<br/>/.../<br/>The problem with such a sequence is that there isn't a point where it can end, or more rightly: it can end <i>anywhere</i>. You wait conscientiously on something new to begin, not on free association but on reincorporation.<br/>Johnstone then gives an example of a man that's being chased by a bear, and the story ends when the man is transformed into a bear and realize that he was the bear that chased him. He brings up what implications that the story probably had, which shouldn't be important, because it disrupts his ability to do free association.<br/><br/>What he also brings up is the basic structure for creating a story. Free association and then reincorporate. I think it's really important to establish things; to establish things in roleplaying games to be used later. Sow and harvest. Setup and payoff. You could say that to buy a skill is to establish it, but it's not established until it comes out in play. I really like the first scene in <b>Dogs in the Vineyard</b> where you play out a scene based on one of the traits that your character got. It not only makes the player more invested in the trait, because framing a scene about an object is spending time on it, the scene also establish the trait for the other participants.<br/><br/>I wish more roleplaying games used setup and payoffs. I wish they pointed this out, incorporated it into the structure of play, as an important part of story building.<br/><br/>p. 130The improviser must be a human who moves backwards. He sees where he has been, but he never worries about what to come. His story can bring him anyway, but he still needs to "balance" it and give it's form by remembering episodes left "hanging" and reincorporate them.<br/>You can see this A LOT in stand-up and any form of improvisational comedy. For the latter, it's not even like the comedians think about what they are doing (or how), it's just the way they are. It comes naturally for them. We, roleplaying gamers, should to do this too.<br/><br/>p. 143-144Suppose that I say "Imagine a box".  A student can anticipate that I should follow up with something like "What's inside?" Instead I say "Who has put you there?".<br/>/.../<br/>We all laugh. I presume that it's because of the implied homosexuality. If I singled that out, then the student would feel like he had to put up his guard. I ignore the implication but concentrating myself instead on pulling the answers from the student as fast as possible. /.../ To answer these questions are easy. The hard part is to ask them, because you need a new angle for each question.<br/>I did some hard cutting in the quotes, but I wanted to repeat the message from previous quotes rather than having a coherent text.<br/><br/>I always say "Ask leading questions instead of suggesting" to a group that I'm about to game master when I talk about helping each other out in a collaborative matter. Why? Because leading questions makes the person take a stand. If I ask "Is it raining?", that would be a very leading question, because it's obvious that I want it to rain. To leave it up to the other person gives that person a choice but also control (the power of <i>be able to use</i> "no"), compared to if I said "It is raining".<br/><br/>But what Johnstone writes in the last sentence is brilliant and something that I will take with me into future session. You shouldn't only ask leading questions, but also bring new angles to every new question.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434961/#Comment_434961" name="Item_150" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-07T16:49:05+00:00" title="July  7, 2014  4:49PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 7, 2014 5:52AM by Rickard.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            NARRATING WITH THEATER, part 2<br/><br/>p. 148One-word-at-the-time-letters usually goes through four stages: (1) The letters are usually careful and filled with nonsense and hidden sexual implications. (2) The letters are obscene and psychological. (3) They are filled of religious feelings. (4) Finally they express vulnerability and loneliness.<br/><br/>Improvisations goes through the same stages if you don't censor them and work in with the same group over time.<br/>If I apply this to some of my own experiences. (1) Dick mountain! (2) Surreal events in order to wait for something to happen. (3) As me being an atheist in a secular country, I'm having a hard time to imagine any of this taking place, but the religious feeling is probably replaced with something else. Perhaps a sense of meaning (WHAT)? (4) Immersion\u2014being invested in something, like a story, the setting, or a character's emotions to mention a few different things.<br/><br/>p. 154An improviser can study status transactions and how you develop an improvisation and "reincorporation" and he can learn how to associate freely and how to spontaneously  develop narration through the form of the theater, and still feel it hard to "compose" a story. But this has actually to do with aesthetic and conceptual reasons. He shouldn't spend energy to invent stories, but to <i>breaking "routines"</i>.<br/><br/>If I say "make up a story", most people will get paralyzed. If I say describe a "routine" (a progress, that constantly goes in one direction, after expected templates), there will be no problem.<br/>/.../<br/>Most people tries to create more <i>interesting</i> routines, which doesn't solve the problem [with "composing a story", my remark]. It can be interesting to have a veterinarian give an elephant a rectal exam, or show a brain surgery performing a delicate operation, but these activities <i>remains</i> routines. If two caretakers breaks the routine by performing a brain surgery, or a winder cleaner starts to exam the elephant, then it's likely that this would generate a narrating progression.<br/>I talked about this before, that breaking routines creates a change and changes are always interesting (give or take). This is why, for example, we got experience rules in roleplaying games, even if they focus more on change in one direction (being better). Breaking routines can also create an uncertainty, to create a curiosity of what to come, which is one of the HOWs that makes us engaged in an activity.<br/><br/>Note that asking questions from different angles is a form of breaking routines. \xbbA student can anticipate that I should follow up with something like "What's inside?" Instead I say "Who has put you there?".\xab<br/><br/>p. 156For a lot of the students, the imagination ends at the moment when they realize that the routine they are describing is about to be fulfilled. They realize that the routine <i>needs</i> to be interrupted, otherwise they wont feel so unimaginative. Their problem is that they are not <i>aware</i> of what's gone wrong. They they finally understood the purpose of "breaking routines", they wont get stuck due to lack of imagination.<br/>I tried the idea of breaking routines during this last year, and it's strange how your mind can take twists and turns in a way you can't even imagine, which sparks new ideas from your own improvised ideas. I do think that you can't think things through, when using this technique, but have instead to be spontaneous. \xbbIt's /.../ very funny to throw yourself out with "Yes, but..." and have to end the sentence on the spot."\xab Please note the mental state instead of the technique. "Throw yourself out" is more important than how you actually being spontaneous.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>This was the final chapter of the four I talked about in the first post in this "series". There is one more about masks, but I don't really see the relevance. Perhaps I will come back to that later, if I take  up on Jung's personalities (masks) or reading about trance. Johnstone talks about trance and hypnosis, and some of what he write is highly connected to flow (theory).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

ethnography of role-playing games, Shared Fantasy, where he described three important frames common to most or all gaming sessions2. First is the social frame, which participants inhabit as friends and fellow hobbyists. Laminated over this is the game frame, where players use rules to manipulate the fiction of the game. This fiction forms the third frame, which participants inhabit as characters. This is a useful framework that helps us understand the management of in-character vs. out-of-character knowledge, for example.</blockquote>\nThese frames corresponds to my thought about my WHATs. Group (social frame), structures (game frame), and fiction (fiction frame). I also got setting and meaning.<br/><br/>The while essay talks about the other frames as non-immersive experiences, but here I am of a different opinion. You can immerse in, for example, game mechanics just as much as you can immerse in fiction. What's interesting is that the essay talks about immersion in fiction where "which participants inhabit as character", and therefor can call it calling it immersion (in character). I'm not even have characters in my WHATs because it's assumed that roles are used within the game.<br/><br/>Ron Edwards <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=3654.0;wap2" rel="nofollow">once wrote</a>:\n<blockquote>I have a lot of private emails people send me about the way that I "dismiss" immersion in my essay, often with very angry and defensive evidence that "it exists," always describing one of the above four things. Since these things are definitely not the same, and since the emotional commitment to the given person's definition seems to be so high ... well, my take is that we're better off deconstructing the issue into independent parts that address anything substantive, and leaving the term to evaporate slowly, if possible.</blockquote>\n"...deconstructing the issue into independent parts..."<br/><br/>I totally agree, which <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/post/quote/18733/Comment_430089" rel="nofollow">I have done and talked about before</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437328/#Comment_437328" name="Item_152" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-15T00:09:33+00:00" title="August 15, 2014 12:09AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 15, 2014 12:10AM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I'm reading this book by Richard Duke, maybe you've heard of it: "Gaming: The Future's Language" (1974).  It's a little hyperbolic in its social predictions, with a wide-eyed naivete that tastes like nostalgia to a first-wave cyberartist like myself, but nonetheless still thought-provoking today.  It's always good to look back at earlier research to see which stones we've left unturned in our mad dash toward "The Future's Language".  Duke's central thesis is that the primary purpose of virtually all games is to convey <i>gestalts</i>, i.e. holistic representations of complex situations.  Here is an excerpt from the preface:<br/><br/>"A careful review of the variety of products currently available as serious games turned up the startling disclosure that they seem to share no single characteristic: neither subject matter nor technique, nor duration, nor client, nor audience configuration, nor paraphernalia, nor style.  In one instance, the logic of math is illustrated by dice (wooden cubes) in an exercise requiring less than an hour; in another instance, a large and carefully-trained staff, supplemented by a mammoth computer, confronts an audience of 50 to 100 people with an exercise of a week's duration.  In one, role-playing is emphasized, and in another, human decision-making is emphasized in an almost sterile man-machine context.  A given exercise uses a board and players move physical objects about in one instance; in another, visual aides are completely absent.  Still another exercise closely mimics or simulates some real-world phenomenon, while another is a completely abstract phenomenon.  Curiously, professionals have no difficulty at all in alluding to all of these as games, or addressing the phenomenon they use as "gaming" even though the particulars are so varied and diffuse.<br/><br/>On the assumption that several thousand professionals did, in fact, understand the phenomenon in practice even though the theory was not coherently expressed, I, deductively, set about in an effort to determine the nature of games.  The process was slow, and entailed the identification of all terms or descriptors employed within the profession.  At the worst moment, over one thousand such terms had been identified.  As the effort proceeded to organize these terms, a unifying perspective began to emerge - games are a form of communication."<br/><br/>Thought you might wanna <a href="http://ocw.metu.edu.tr/pluginfile.php/6890/mod_resource/content/2/74duke-gamingthefutureslanguage-100211123056-phpapp02.pdf" rel="nofollow">check it out</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437344/#Comment_437344" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-15T08:42:28+00:00" title="August 15, 2014  8:42AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 16, 2014 8:06AM by Rickard.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I got it from the homepage you recommended.

I should dig deeper into this. What I found is so delightful is that I found a source talking about meaning, relationship and social responsibility, and how creativity, autotelic tasks and possibility/accomplishment are part of fulfillment and the feel of happiness. And that it takes <i>work</i>. Meaning and group are part of my WHATs. Creativity and accomplishment are part of the WHY Expression (and slightly Competition). The combination of WHATs and WHYs, connected through the HOWs (decision, uncertainty, effort [=work]), are what I think creates engagement. Engagement is what I want from games. The result of engagement is happiness.<br/><br/>It may sound very hippie-like, but this is what I want to discover.

He was into speedracing and when he won his fist world championship, it took him years to win a second time. Why? Because he started to focus on winning. It wasn't until he went back and started to enjoy his own sport that he won the championship again, and he did that five years in a row. Here is a quote from the scientific paper (page 15):\n<blockquote>The present work, in contrast, examined process-based rather than outcome-based thinking. Participants reflected on and committed to a specific plan for attaining their goals, which has been shown to greatly increase rather than decrease goal achievement<br/><br/>/.../<br/><br/>Our work therefore revealed how planning for the future can positively impact goal management. Zhang et al. (2007) showed, quite importantly, that a focus on future successes can be costly.</blockquote>\nWhat they basically say is that if you focus on the success, the intrinsic motivation will decrease. If you instead focus on the process of achieving your goal, the motivation will increase. Based on the story from Tony Rickardsson and several other athletes, I think the opposite is true too. Think of the fun, and success will follow.<br/><br/>I don't really know how this revelation can benefit our hobby but I'm sure it will come up in the future.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437950/#Comment_437950" name="Item_160" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-29T19:54:50+00:00" title="August 29, 2014  7:54PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've seen many GMs posting about how they're literally <i>intimidated</i> by the rules of certain games, afraid of doing it wrong, basically.

F. Skinner created a box, an operant conditioning chamber, with a button for pigeons to peck on. He showed how he could affect their button pressing through a tangible reward mechanism (food). What he later discovered was that humans were affected in the same way as pigeons, and that he could control their <i>active </i>choice through the reward. Extra Credits talks more about this:<br/><br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-tWtvrPTbQ_c?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWtvrPTbQ_c"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/tWtvrPTbQ_c/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span><br/><br/>Chris Bateman has a summary of Skinner's results over at <a href="http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2005/08/designing_rewar.html" rel="nofollow">one of his blogs</a>:\n<blockquote> <b>Fixed Ratio Schedules</b>: these provide rewards after a fixed number of actions. They produce a high level of activity and are easy to understand, but after the reward is achieved, there is a pause. XP in CRPGs is an example - although the gearing of XP systems is exponential, the intent is that the player is constantly moving up to tougher foes, thus keeping a constant ratio of kills to level. /.../<br/><br/> <b>Variable Ratio Schedules:</b> these provide rewards after a random number of actions - like a slot machine. You keep putting in coins, because at some point it will pay out. These also produce a high rate of activity and interest, but they tend to block exploration - as the player will stick with the reward schedule until it is exhausted, or until they burn out on it. Effective with all play styles - but burnout is always a risk. /.../<br/><br/> <b>Fixed Interval Schedule:</b> that is, a reward is provided after a set amount of time. This provides better control over the rate of reward, and comes with the same post-reward pause as a fixed ratio schedule. Indeed, pauses are inherent to fixed schedules of all kinds. An example is the new items in the shop each day in Animal Crossing - the player comes back on future days to see what's new.<br/><br/> <b>Variable Interval Schedule:</b> like the variable ratio schedule, this produces a steady rate of activity with no pauses - but its not as intense as the variable ratio schedule, because players quickly learn that their actions are independent of the reward. Good for encouraging a player to come back to certain places in a game, however, if a reward appears in certain places 'at random'.</blockquote>\nSome players say that they enjoy rolling dice [to see if they succeed]. Why? Because it follows a Variable Ratio Schedule, and strikes the same response in the brain as playing slot machines. I'm personally not keen on using exploits in human psychology to make my games more attractive, and an ethical discussion should be held around this. Of course, dice rolls also brings uncertainty but sometimes at the cost of the decision-making. If you increased your chances to a 90 % chance of succeeding, that last 10 % will tell you that all that planning you did was useless. That said, dice can be used as a "fun" element to bring uncertainty and therefor curiosity of what to come. I see no harm in random encounter tables, as an example.<br/><br/><b>A Different View on Rewards</b><br/>Chris Bateman also lists several different kinds of rewards on that page: Currency Rewards, Rank Rewards, Mechanical Rewards, Narrative rewards, Emotional Rewards, New Toys, New Places, Completeness, Victory.

I believe that a task should be <i>autotelic</i>, meaning that doing the task has a purpose of it's own. This is a "No shit, Sherlock" moment but to be able to create a game that is "fun", you need to attract the right target audience that thinks that the task in the game is fun to do on it's own. You can't play Ludo, expecting Chess. You can't play a railroad, expecting collaborative storytelling.

He found flow.<br/><br/>This will be a translation back to English from the Swedish translation. I talked about <i>flow</i> earlier, as a state of happiness. All these quotes are based upon heavily grounded research and aren't just philosophical ideas. If anyone would like it, I could give the resources that his statements are based upon. As for now, to avoid wall of text, I wont.<br/><br/>I will write my thoughts during the reading of the book, and how what I read can be applied to roleplaying games.<br/><br/>THE TASK TO CREATE FLOW\n<blockquote>Not that materialism is bad in itself, because up to a certain level, we get happier of owning and using our possessions. All humans are in a way materialists. /.../ To be dependent of objects to reach happiness leads to an escalation of a zero-sum game: just as addiction demands constant doses of new acquisitions, and if someone doesn't have more gadgets than its neighbor, they don't really have anything of great value.<div>p. 46</div></blockquote>\nI think this is important to realize when it comes to rewards in roleplaying games.\n<blockquote>To reach your potentials, which usually creates happiness, depends of two simultaneous processes. /.../ The first one is <i>differentiations</i> where one realize that we are unique individuals, responsible for our own survival and satisfaction, willing to develop our unique self wherever it may take us, meanwhile we enjoy how we express ourselves in action. The second process is about <i>integration</i> or the insight that no matter how unique we are, we're also totally encapsulated in a network of relations with other people, with cultural symbols and objects, and the surrounding environment.p. 47</blockquote>\nIn <b>Feng Shui</b>, you got -2 if you described actions in a repetitive way. I never played with that rule because it would stand in the way of contribution - the feeling of being heard by expressing yourself. Someone should be able to contribute without having to be judged by someone else, and to get feedback in form of being listened to so you feel that you done something both for and with the group.<br/><br/>In <b>Feng Shui 2</b>, Robin D Laws removed that rule.<br/><br/>Do note that getting a -2 for doing a boring description is the same thing as getting +2 for doing a good one. It's just different sides of the same coin. Remember what I said about rewards in roleplaying games. What do they really do psychologically?<br/><br/>If you want people to do something, make them do it because they think it's fun. That's self-expression/differentiation. Create structures in form of rules or techniques to make them realize what they are supposed to do. Don't bribe them with rewards; that's only designing to give them a false choice and to use an exploit in the human mind (addictive behavior).\n<blockquote>A human that is fully differentiated and integrated becomes a <i>complex</i> individual - an individual that has the best chances to live a happy, vital, and meaningful life.p. 47</blockquote>\nA player that can both feel integrated in the group while having the chances to pursuit self-expression has the best chances to experience a fun and meaningful session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438649/#Comment_438649" name="Item_167" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-24T04:05:40+00:00" title="September 24, 2014  4:05AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 16, 2014 11:06AM by Rickard.">edited December 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            HAPPINESS IN ACTION, part one<br/>I talked about <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/post/quote/18733/Comment_429827" rel="nofollow">the flow state</a> before and eight components that can be present in various degrees, even to a degree where it's non-existent, when flow is reached. This chapter talks about these eight points below so I will only quote parts of it that I think are food for thoughts.\n<blockquote>1. A challenge activity that requires skills<br/>2. The merging of action and awareness<br/>3. Clear goals<br/>4. Direct feedback<br/>5. Concentration on the task at hand<br/>6. The sense of control<br/>7. The loss of self-consciousness<br/>8. The transformation of time</blockquote>\n<blockquote>In contrary belief, happiness is nothing that just comes to us. It's something <i>we</i> make happens, and it comes as a result of us doing our best.p. 57</blockquote>\nOne thing that bothers me with flow is that it seems like it focuses a lot on competence; about mastery of task. This is what Theory of Fun also is about, possibly inspired by flow. Cs\xedkszentmih\xe1lyi do talk about reading books as the most common flow state (p. 60), and watching a play can be another passive way of achieving flow. So the quote above is not really about <i>doing</i> an activity, it's about seeking activities.<br/><br/>I will return to this in the next part.\n<blockquote>The moment where you find pleasure can be both physical and mentally painful; but because the pleasure consist of triumph over the powers of entropy and decadence, it will strengthen the spirit. Pleasure is the foundation for memories that, when you look back, enlighten life and gives confidence for the future.<div>p. 58</div></blockquote>\nPleasure comes from looking back at what you accomplished during a roleplaying session.\n<blockquote>...you get so involved in the task and all its complexity that you get absorbed by it. /.../ Flow is often the result to be together with others in a close collaboration.<div>p. 60-61</div></blockquote>\nThe words in the Swedish language can be combined to create new words. Samber\xe4ttande is a Swedish roleplaying term for \xbbcollaborate storytelling\xab. It consist of the word "sam-" and "-ber\xe4ttande". The last word means narrating but the first one means both togetherness (samh\xf6righet) and cooperation (samarbete). There have been many sessions when I played samber\xe4ttande (collaborative storytelling) where I had flow, and the feeling of togetherness and cooperation were a huge part of that.\n<blockquote>The real pleasure lies within the steps you take towards the goal, and not actually achieving it. /.../ To care excessively about the end result often <div>p. 63-64 (Clear goals)</div></blockquote>\nThis brings me back to when I <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/437949#Comment_437949" rel="nofollow">talked earlier about</a> the scientific paper <i>Consider It Done! Plan Making Can Eliminate the Cognitive Effects of Unfulfilled Goals</i>.\n<ul>"The present work, in contrast, examined process-based rather than outcome-based thinking. Participants reflected on and committed to a specific plan for attaining their goals, which has been shown to greatly increase rather than decrease goal achievement /.../ Our work therefore revealed how planning for the future can positively impact goal management. Zhang et al. (2007) showed, quite importantly, that a focus on future successes can be costly."</ul>\n<blockquote>Feedback can come from colleagues or foreman commenting what you do, but it's best when the activity itself gives that information.<div>p. 64 (Direct feedback)</div></blockquote>\nI always found it hard to create a system where the participants praised each other, because it seemed kind of meta and artificial (and "fan mail" is NOT the answer). I talked a lot about making people contribute and to make them interact with each other. One part of interaction is responding, which is a feedback. I'm currently experimenting with techniques that creates a comfort within the group by building up a framework for interaction. That's when the activity creates feedback, by using the participants, rather than adding a guideline "outside the system" that the participants should cheer for each other.\n<blockquote>A good flow activity offers many levels of complexity<div>p. 66 (The merging of action and awareness)</div></blockquote>\nFocus on the tactical aspect one day and the creative one the next. I will tell you why in the next part.\n<blockquote>You don't need to force the mind to think sharply, as when you try to solve a mathematical problem; on the contrary, the process seems effortless /.../ When \xbbthinking\xab begins the melting between the author and writing starts to break. The poet tried to form ideas in words on a conscious way instead of letting the words flow and fall in place naturally. But when a poet is in flow, he concentrates instead on the words that appears in the mind, he cherish them and fight to understand their meaning - rather than forcing them to follow his own will.<div>p. 70 (The merging of action and awareness)</div></blockquote>\nWhen I talk about the system of roleplaying games and how they should cherish interaction\u2014of how they should be looked upon as a conversation\u2014this is what I mean. It should be a constant back and forth where one participant takes the other participants' actions into mind. This is what happens during a fruitful session of collaborative storytelling, but IMHO also during a session of a traditional roleplaying game, where the game master cherish the players' ideas instead of forcing them to follow an already assigned route (sequential play).<br/><br/>I know situations where the scenario seemed to play itself. When no matter what the players came up with, I had a proper response. Where I felt I was in full control, even when the players surprised me. Things happened. Things I couldn't foresee. Time and space disappeared. It was just us; we and the activity we're doing. All together in one system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438680/#Comment_438680" name="Item_168" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-25T04:12:38+00:00" title="September 25, 2014  4:12AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 16, 2014 10:58AM by Rickard.">edited December 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            HAPPINESS IN ACTION, part two<br/>The book tends to use general words like "pleasure", "ecstasy" and "happiness". Words that can mean anything to anyone. I'm more curious of HOW or WHY to reach those than what these words actually mean to each and every one.\n<blockquote>Your mind can't handle too many stimuli at the same time. If we really concentrate our attention on one particular task - independent if it's a question about mountain climbing or compose music - we can't perceive anything outside this narrow field of attention.<div>p. 72 (The merging of action and awareness)</div></blockquote>\nMixing different playstyles, different WHYs combined with WHATs, breaks flow. I never liked how <b>Mouse Guard</b> mixed both tactical play with narration with dilemma. I never felt it had a nice flow with that game as when I played games that focused surely on tactical play, narration (in form of <i>descriptive challenges</i>), or dilemmas. Focus on the tactical aspect one day and the creative one the next.\n<blockquote>When you're in flow, the activity demands full attention, and the problems that bothers you in the everyday life have no chance to make any presence in the mind. This is the reason a pleasurable experience creates a sense of ecstasy, the feeling of be in another world. /.../ The world of flow is not only limited in the space but also time: because attention must focus on the now, events that happened in the past or future wont fit in the mind.<div>p. 57 (The transformation of time)</div></blockquote>\n"Don't plan ahead" is a mantra used in improv. The meaning of that mantra is that if you plan ahead, you will be more inclined to stick to that and block any attempts that might change that outcome. You will be less inclined to take other contributions into consideration. The quote above is another reason why you shouldn't plan ahead. You could, and should, have a clear goal of where you want to go, but not assume the outcome of it.<br/><br/>Also, don't focus on the outcome of success (the result of the plan). That's something that is in the future. Focus on what happens now; the journey to the future.\n<blockquote>But what they forget is their social persona /.../ with all the responsibility that are tied to that. It's an ecstatic feeling to, in a blink of an eye, be relieved from the consciousness about yourself, about ambitions and defeats, fears and wishes. /.../ It's common to forget who you are during a flow experience, but afterwards your self-awareness returns in a stronger form than before.<div>p. 80-81 (The loss of self-consciousness)</div><br/><br/></blockquote>\nWhat he talks about is the reason why people seek different kinds of immersion. I see an explanation of why people seek character immersion - <i>bleed</i> in LARP - where the character's emotions bleed into your own mind. This can happen for a chess player as well, where the world is the chess board. <i>Presence </i>is another form of immersion in computer games, where the game world becomes the real world for the player. I've felt emotions for characters in a book or a movie, and I have lost myself in stories told in a collaborative manner with my friends around a table.<br/><br/>Listen to what Heather Anne Campbell's reason is to why she does improv. It's like she's talking about roleplaying games.

Flow is something you seek out. Not seeking out, as in doing certain activities that brings flow, but something you can seek out in any activity. Try to find the purpose of your activity. Make it autotelic (doing a task for the purpose of doing the task). That is what is <i>intrinsically rewarding</i>. You can be a well-paid surgeon but if you love what you do, no money will make it either more or less fun. Compare the surgeon's salary to mechanical rewards in roleplaying games. Compare this to how roleplaying games seldom conveys why anyone would play that game. Roleplaying games should be better at guiding the participants in finding what's fun with that particular game. In finding the purpose of playing that game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438730/#Comment_438730" name="Item_169" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-26T11:30:54+00:00" title="September 26, 2014 11:30AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 16, 2014 10:49AM by Rickard.">edited December 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FLOW AND DEVELOPMENT<br/>I didn't think I would benefit at all from reading this chapter.\n<blockquote>... one of the main requirements for flow, the balance between challenge and skill.<div>p. 88</div></blockquote>\nThis is the main reason why I think flow is mainly about skill mastery. The book said on page 60 that reading a book is the most common source of flow but in this chapter, Cs\xedkszentmih\xe1lyi talks purely about challenge. This chapter can mostly be summed up by the following picture.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Challenge_vs_skill.svg/300px-Challenge_vs_skill.svg.png"/>\n<blockquote>Flow attracts progression. If you want to stay in flow, you must do progress, and learn more to ascend to a higher level of complexity /.../ Anyone would quickly get tired on any kind of labor if the challenges remains on the same level.<div>p. 89</div></blockquote>\nI'm going to take this out of its context, where Cs\xedkszentmih\xe1lyi talks about increasing in skill. I have previously talked about how <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/433814#Comment_433814" rel="nofollow">change keeps up the interest</a>. I do agree that progress, often in form of increasing skills, leads to change but it's not the only way change can occur.<br/><br/>Jim Butcher talks about the <a href="http://jimbutcher.livejournal.com/2880.html" rel="nofollow">aftereffects of conflict</a> in stories, and how they really are the interesting part because they are the consequences of the conflict. The conflict brings uncertainty but it's the consequences that are the changes.\n<blockquote>Everything from textiles to weapons, from houses to meals becomes more complex: harder to manufacture but easier to use. /.../ The evolution of culture is based on the differentiation and integration of earlier manufactured objects and previous knowledge. /.../ Groups of people can also be described as more or less complex<div>p. 95</div></blockquote>\nRemember from the earlier chapter that a complex person is a person who is fully differentiated (self-expressing) and integrated (with others). The first cameras was really simple but hard to use. The more they developed, the more differentiated they became but integrated with the users, the more complex they became but also simpler to use.<br/><br/>The same thing happens with a group. Inside jokes are born, social "house rules" are created, hierarchies are set, and playstyles are formed. The participants becomes more and more integrated with each other and the group becomes  more and more differentiated. Shortcuts can be made; shortcuts that will make it harder for someone new to arrive to the group; shortcuts that we wont realize that we created ourselves.<br/><br/>This ... is ... why I made this thread. Our hobby is still young but we have learned a lot over time. We got artifacts from other games and previous knowledge from game creators, but who knows how a camera works nowadays? We know that certain things work but not why. It's too complex for us to realize how the group is created, even if it's easy to use. I want to draw knowledge from that, to explain the first parts and how they fit together and what result they bring. I want to rediscover what we take for granted, mostly so I can continue to differentiate them and then integrate with others. I would like roleplaying games to build the group and help out differentiate and integrate it. Because I feel that we have come as far as we can. Something new must happen, and something groundbreaking.<br/><br/>I'm not the only one who thinks this, because the whole OSR movement is basically doing the same thing. Their WHY is however not the same as mine so I have to find my own way.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I thought I wouldn't benefit at all from reading this chapter. I was wrong.<br/><br/>The next part of the book is about flow and organizations and the reason why I picked up this particular book about flow in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438842/#Comment_438842" name="Item_170" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-30T04:34:56+00:00" title="September 30, 2014  4:34AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 16, 2014 10:47AM by Rickard.">edited December 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WHY FLOW WONT APPEAR AT WORK<br/>The chapter dives deeper into some these points.\n<blockquote>1.

The third is to steer the working moral in the organization in a positive direction...<div>p. 118</div></blockquote>\nIf we would start looking at roleplaying games as work, because they <i>are </i>demanding like all games (Bernard Suits: Games are inefficient. The rules impose obstacles that prevent the player from reaching their goal through the most efficient means), WHY would anyone want to do it?\n<blockquote>...contemporary jobs seldom gives <i>adequate feedback</i>.p. 125</blockquote>\nNothing in most jobs says anything about that person's skill. A coworker is replaceable, as in comparison to a carpenter where every movement with the tools are sign of that person's skill.<br/><br/>When I pitch roleplaying games on conventions or bigger gatherings, I focus on the purpose of the game. Why would anyone want to play that particular game? I noticed that I can't do that with boardgames because it's assumed that we play it to win. Roleplaying games are different here; more diverse, if I may say so. Where boardgames have different requirements of skills but with the same goal - to win - roleplaying games seldom have the same purpose. One game can be to have your character's emotion <i>bleed</i> into your own feelings, another could be to create a plot together, a third about discover how the history affects the present day. Some roleplaying games are played to Compete for victory, but a lot focuses on Expressing yourself, to Explore, to get a Sensation, or simply to Destroying structures or otherwise feeling powerful.<br/><br/>These things are the feedback that the roleplaying game should give. Rewards is a subcategory to feedback, and I would like to say that all kinds of feedback is a reward if it has anything to do with the participant's purpose of doing that activity. If you want to play to loose your own persona into a character, the game should send feedback that helps you achieve that. If you want to do tactical decisions, the game should feed you more tactical choices back to you. The more you do this kind of circular exchange, the more invested you become in the activity. That's how flow/immersion/presences/being in the zone is achieved. That's how you gain intrinsic rewards. That's how you reach fulfillment.\n<blockquote>Another feature in many jobs is <i>the lack of control</i>. /.../ Both these complaints comes from the feeling to be reduced to a tool where any possibility to affect the company where you work.p. 127</blockquote>\nI can totally understand people that hate railroading. When I game master sequential play, I make sure that the players got control over certain areas, like how to portray their character, how they can create things in the environment, or take shortcuts in the adventure. I'm also very open with what they can and cannot change, so they don't focus on the parts where they don't have control.<br/><br/>So even if they are spectators of a sensational ride, they still got control over certain areas which can affect how they will perceive the adventure. Of course, if your purpose of being a player is restricted to only control the fiction, this is not the style of play you're after.\n<blockquote>As we previously pointed out, young people grow up with different social capital in form of support from parents, education, and resources from the society. Some learn to build up a psychological capital; other don't. When they grown up enough to work, some are so brainwashed by culture that they can't see a job as anything else than <i>work</i>.p. 136</blockquote>\nA tiger spends energy to hunt, in hope to get more energy. Doing mental or social exercises do drain our energy - our psychological capital. Roleplaying games are work, so why don't we think of it as work? What is it we get back from it?<br/><br/>It's basically what the previous chapters have talked about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438876/#Comment_438876" name="Item_171" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-01T09:07:06+00:00" title="October  1, 2014  9:07AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 16, 2014 10:45AM by Rickard.">edited December 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            TO BUILD FLOW IN AN ORGANIZATION<br/><br/>This will be the last chapter to comment because I didn't feel the last two that followed after this one had anything to bring. Both this chapter and the one before are mostly repetition of what has already been established.\n<blockquote>People often believe that a successful leader in the business world have to know a lot about what the organization does - namely what the product or the service that the organization has specialized on. It's certainly valuable knowledge, but the main task is to make people work effectively together.<div>p. 144</div></blockquote>\nThe best way to improvise is to be well prepared because it will create a great feeling of control, but the game master also needs to make the group work together.\n<blockquote>You can't demand a human to do its best. You can't demand Beethoven to compose his ninth symphony. He must want to do it himself. /.../ The best way to create such organization is to provide it with the conditions needed for the employed to experience flow.<div>p. 144-145</div></blockquote>\nThe game master must be able to create a positive group feeling (team spirit), where everyone feel comfort, creativity, willing to participate, create spontaneity, but also tickle everyone's playstyle ... or, as I prefer it, convey the playstyle so the players can adopt to it.<br/><br/>What Cs\xedkszentmih\xe1lyi have in mind is to challenge the players and constantly increase the difficulty as the players' skill level increase. Not sure I agree with that because we got other ways of making the players invest more and more into the game. The previous paragraph lists the effects. I already talked about <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/437949#Comment_437949" rel="nofollow">intrinsic motivation</a> and <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/433056#Comment_433056" rel="nofollow">the constant loop to create investment</a> (see my image below).<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://erebaltor.se/rickard/utmaning_immersion.png"/>\n<blockquote>It's impossible to create an environment that achieves flow without the involvement of the company management. The leaders must accept the thought that products, winnings and market shares are put behind the emotional wellbeing of the employers.<div>p. 151</div></blockquote>\nThe game master shouldn't focus on the adventure, or anything related to it, but instead be aware if everybody enjoys the adventure.\n<blockquote>It's hard for the employers to concentrate to fulfill the companies goal if they don't understand those goals - or worse, misunderstanding them /.../ There can be many reasons why goals like that aren't clear in many organizations. Firstly, <i>the assignment for the organization /.../ isn't clear for everyone</i>, including the highest management. /.../ Secondly, <i>the assignment is unclear for the product management</i>. /.../ Thirdly, it could be so that <i>the assignment is unclear for the subordinate</i>.p. 153, 155-157</blockquote>\nI lacked knowledge about what I wanted with my first published roleplaying game. It became a hybrid of two different playstyles. If I don't know what I want with my own game, how could I then make other people understand it? A roleplaying game should be written so that the game master can teach the players the information in it. I feel that few roleplaying games actually does that. A good game master can save any game, by imposing his or her own playstyle and making the players grok it. The players must also be open-minded with what kind of playstyles that they can accept. If someone only wants to think in a tactical way, that wont do it for a group that wants to experiment with different kinds of playstyles from now and then.\n<blockquote>To be in the loop of how well you're doing something and be well prepared on the  task, it's meaningful to create routines for three sources of feedback. The first is <i>feedback from other people.</i> /.../ The second source of information is <i>feedback from the work itself</i>. /.../ The last source comes from <i>feedback from your own personal standards.</i>p. 164, 169-170</blockquote>\nTo be able to grow as a game master, you must be aware of what happens around the table. To take in the feedback that you are given. Are everybody enjoying what we're doing?

It doesn't matter that much what happens along the way, because the players got something to strive for. So if this is the beginning, what's the end?<br/><br/><b>Start With the End</b><br/>Extra Credits suggests that when you start with a game's narrative, you should start <i>at the end</i>. I talked about change in the previous chapter and will now show examples of structures that has change in <br/><br/>Joseph Campbell's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth" rel="nofollow">The Hero's Journey</a> end with the hero returning ... changed.<br/><br/>Dan Harmon's Story Circle is his own take on the monomyth above, and it ends in the following way:\n<blockquote>    7.

To update your perspective from the information received. When I read this, I instantly thought of the feedback loop in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/429816#Comment_429816" rel="nofollow">character immersion</a>, the circular exchange in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/429827#Comment_429827" rel="nofollow">the skill atom and flow</a>, and of course my own model of how the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/433056#Comment_433056" rel="nofollow">constant loop</a> in an interaction model makes you invested. <br/><br/>Do note that everything above is only <i>one</i> example. Other types of changes can be tilts, or the fact that you have to take the other participants contributions into account. The last is something that is typical for roleplaying games but not a lone screenwriter.re.<br/><br/><b>Reincorporation</b><br/>The ending of a story is not purely about having things changing. With change reincorporation must happen. Otherwise no one will notice the change. Keith Johnston <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/434960#Comment_434960" rel="nofollow">talks about this</a> in <i>Impro</i>. You can sit and throw up new information constantly but it's not until we start to reincorporate to what has been established previously that we realize that the story is coming to its end. The Story Circle does this after half the journey. "As you might expect with a circular model like this, there is a lot of symmetry going on, and on the journey back upward, we're going to be doing a lot of referencing to the journey downward."<br/><br/>This is change that creates the base for the drive. Everybody should know where everybody wants to go so people could take that into consideration. We also need to get things started, and we can do that by setting up elements from the end in the beginning so we can gain payoff by reincorporate it when it's closing towards the end. So to create "drama" we need to start in the end to establish where we want to go. <br/><br/>Just as I did with this post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439091/#Comment_439091" name="Item_174" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-06T08:34:17+00:00" title="October  6, 2014  8:34AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 12, 2015 11:27AM by Rickard.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<h4>The Importance of HOW</h4>\nWhen I first talked about HOWs, I attached states of mind to each of the three forms of interaction. Uncertainty brought suspense, Decision tension, and with Effort came challenge. I was never satisfied with this, because it was mostly done so I could show my view of how a challenge never came with dice rolls alone. A game master could never challenge <i>a player</i> by throwing in a locked door. <b>Mouse Guard</b> has this kind of (non-)challenge in its model for adventure writing, as an example of how wide spread this misconception is. The game master in that game shall create three "challenges" that have to evoke dice rolling to be defeated.<br/><br/>A question was raised during the discussion about HOW of why a fisherman continues fishing day out and day in no matter what the weather was like. Why would s/he do that?<br/><br/>I also showed my view of what happened if I tied investment into the HOWs. With Uncertainty gamble would occur, with Decision you would get planning, and with Effort there would be a struggle. I'm not sure if this is true at all, but what I wanted was to show how you could create certain ways of interacting through these combination.<br/><br/>Talking about change above made me think of a third thing that explains the importance of the three HOWs.<blockquote><b>Uncertainty</b> is created through <i>change</i>. Not knowing how things will change, suspense is created.<br/><b>Decision</b> leads to <i>interactivity</i>. Any tension created through decision-making enforces planning. This is however not true in the lowest form of decision-making, like deciding what kind of potato crisp that you want or if you want it at all. I will have to think more about this.<br/><b>Effort</b> leads to <i>participation</i>. You want the people involved to participate in a game, no matter how easy or hard the challenge is.</blockquote>You want change, interactivity and participation but the real tools that you should use are uncertainty, decision and effort. They are the things you can grasp. Things you can use. It's like talking about fun and then showing a tool to have fun with, like skipping ropes.<br/><br/><b>Control vs Surprise</b><br/>Greg Costikyan starts off in his book <i>Uncertainty in Games</i> about how we want control in our lives.\n<blockquote>Uncertainty is not, in most circumstances, a good thing. We do not wish to be uncertain about whether we can pay our bills, uncertain of the affections of the people who matter to us, uncertain about our health, or uncertain about our job prospects<br/><br/>/.../<br/><br/>But the reality is that we are faced with uncertainty throughout our lives\u2014and that much of our effort is devoted to managing and ameliorating that uncertainty. Is it any wonder, then, that we have taken this aspect of our lives, and transformed it culturally, made a series of elaborate constructs that subject us to uncertainty\u2014but in a fictive and nonthreatening way?<br/><br/>I'm talking about games, of course.<div>p. 8-9</div></blockquote>\nI keep thinking of how Keith Johnstone in <i>Impro</i> says that naysayers keep control in their lives while yaysayers are rewarded with adventure.<br/><br/>Keith Burgun discusses <a href="http://keithburgun.net/my-practice-2013-talk-is-up-on-vimeo/" rel="nofollow">in a seminar</a> that a meaningful decision is somewhere in the middle of the scale between answer and guess.<br/><br/>Costikyan's and Burgun's points can be narrowed down to these two scales.<br/><br/>Solution &lt;--------- x ---------&gt; Guess<br/>Predictability &lt;--------- x ---------&gt; Uncertainty<br/><br/>If there is one clear <i>solution</i>, no choices are to be made. <i>Guesses</i> are created when there aren't enough information and one choice will be as good as the other. A guess means that it will have no meaningfulness to the decision.<br/><br/>Being able to <i>predict</i> the outcome is usually good, but not when you want to be entertained. You want some suspense of what to come. On the other hand, you should have an idea of the outcome to create expectations. Whether they are fulfilled, broken or if they come with a twist could still be left as an <i>uncertainty</i>.<br/><br/>Looking at these two scales, the first being about Decision and the second about Uncertainty, I wonder if not all HOWs are about control vs surprise. An everyday walk is always controlled but if there wouldn't be anything different from day to day, I presume the walk would become boring. There is a balance between the inner factor, where you can control things, and outer factors like weather, sleep and other humans. (I just made up inner and outer factor. There could be two other forces instead.)<br/><br/>It still doesn't say anything about the fisherman though, but I think it's more a WHY than a result of the HOW. When I talk about WHY, HOW and WHAT, I talk from a game designer's perspective and present them as tools to build an activity.

I need to reread the game, but it's like one paragraph in a 300+ pages book. And spending resources without knowing what to come is just a pure guess and not a meaningful decision when it comes to handling resources. The only meaning comes in the Decision if that particular situation is worth its cost to overcome, by involving the character's belief, but that's a tension through a dilemma and not a challenge. According to my categorization anyway, where Effort from the participant must be involved for a task to become a challenge.

In TV series, you already know what the stakes are because the conflict is about what the person cares about so you don't need to create stakes. I think a good system would create characters where each individual have a couple of goals but also personality traits. They must first be established and then either one will change during the course of the game when they are tested against each other, or if new information rises where the player (through the character) must update goals nor traits accordingly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439233/#Comment_439233" name="Item_178" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-08T15:30:09+00:00" title="October  8, 2014  3:30PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was down on Mouse Guard until I played it.

It has countervailing weaknesses: in excess, it imbalances games, it can foster a sense that success is a consequence of luck rather than excellent play, and it can produce frustration when a streak of bad luck affects a player. But given the ease with which it fosters uncertainty, it has a useful role to play in many games. As always, whether or not to harness randomness in a design is as much a matter of aesthetics as anything else; it has no place in a game of abstract strategy, but it is almost essential in a simulation.<div>p. 86</div></blockquote>\nI don't fancy randomness anymore. I prefer Player Uncertainty/Social Contingency in roleplaying games.\n<blockquote>Most game design is imitative; that is, a designer typically looks to existing, successful games, adopts proven mechanics, and alters mainly theme, setting, and story (if any). Innovation tends to be incremental, the designer seeking to improve or add a new aspect to existing mechanics. In part, this is because of the conservatism of publishers, who (mostly wrongly) believe they are minimizing financial risk by minimizing design risk; in part, it is because few designers have the confidence and desire to innovate in more fundamental ways.<br/><br/>Thus, most designers, most of the time, do not think about where uncertainty lies in their games; they are working within a well-known genre, and the mechanics they adopt have already been shown to produce results that please players. The uncertainties the genre creates are already tuned.<div>p. 105</div></blockquote>\nI'm tired of randomness and how people use it to build roleplaying games in a certain way. We got terms like "GM-less" and "dice-less" because it's assumed that a roleplaying game should have those elements. If game designers started to question these fundamental things, I think we would see totally different games. They would probably do the same thing, but in a totally different matter.\n<blockquote>Typically, when designers think about tuning gameplay, they think about tuning the difficulty of existing systems. In a platformer, if the game seems too easy, you make the time window for player response narrower; if it seems too hard, you expand the time window or work to make the controls crisper and more responsive. /.../<br/><br/>What designers rarely do is introduce a new and different form of uncertainty, because this is not an immediately obvious way to handle the problem. And yet, doing this can be quite powerful and lead to highly original work.<div>p. 109-110</div></blockquote>\nRandomness are used to make things less predictable but <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/422143#Comment_422143" rel="nofollow">as this post shows</a> there are many ways of creating uncertainty. I find the notion of fine-tuning the uncertainty, to make the game harder or easier, interesting.

His base of categorizing a task goes from toy -&gt; simulator -&gt; contest -&gt; game, where each step has a requirement that has to be fulfilled to make it fit into that category. While roleplaying games have, for example, a combat system that may look like a contest, the roleplaying game itself usually lack a <i>structure of play</i> that involves the combat system. Instead, it's a tool for the game master to build an adventure around. It's not until the the game's structure of play says "There has to be two combats in an adventure" that the roleplaying game can be considered being at least a contest.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-R9io0mK-5Ec?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9io0mK-5Ec"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/R9io0mK-5Ec/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span><br/><br/>The key word in this video is \xbbheuristic learning\xab (learning from doing, and <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/425912/#Comment_425912" rel="nofollow">what is an emotional response to learning</a>?). The video is another source that talks about cycles in games. All my learning, that a game state is updated through constant feedback cycles, have made me wonder if I only saw half the picture when I talked about <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/420991#Comment_420991" rel="nofollow">pools and procedures</a>. When I wrote that post, I had a sequence in mind with an end result. What I learned during this last year is that I need to look at a <i>process</i> instead of the end result. The process comes in form of a feedback cycle.<br/><br/>Realizing this turns a lot on its end. I now see game mechanics and, even more frighteningly, game designers that design game with only an end result in mind. It doesn't matter what leads up to that result or how it affects the players, it's only the result that is important. This is, to give an example, one reason why we got so much <i>design-through-rewards</i> in roleplaying games. If the game designer wants people to learn Korean, the only thing that matters is that they actually talk Korean. So a "good" and well accepted way of achieving this is to give the players rewards when they do that.<br/><br/>Instead, I suggest creating a feedback cycle where speaking Korean is part of the whole process of playing the game. That's what the game <b>Magicians</b> do. Because when you design by giving tangible rewards as a carrot, that can obstruct the real purpose of why the players should do the task. Are they doing it because of the fun of doing the task or is  it because if the carrot?<br/><br/>Scientific research has shown that the intrinsic reward, the "feel good" feeling, of doing the task is either unaffected or decreased by extrinsic rewards (money, XP, et c.) [<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/437949/#Comment_437949" rel="nofollow">exceptions</a> in first paragraph]. Games like <b>Primetime Adventures</b> and <b>Burning Wheel</b> are built around rewards because the game designer have only looked at the end result. Having the players praise the other players by giving them fan mail in Primetime Adventures can do one of two things: either the player getting the reward realize what the reward actually is about (getting praise) which means that the reward itself doesn't do anything, or the player does the task because of the reward. Either way, this is <i>sloppy and also hurtful design</i> born from a sequential thinking where only the end result is important to achieve, instead of looking at the whole process and what kind of result that process produces.<br/><br/>Sure, both games achieve the result they intended but at what cost?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440908/#Comment_440908" name="Item_182" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-15T13:56:46+00:00" title="December 15, 2014  1:56PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 11, 2018 10:22AM by Rickard.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<h3>The Major Dramatic Curve</h3>\n Gustav Freytag sat one day down and started to analyze Greek and Shakespearian drama.

The following below is taken from the <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/RizkyWinanda/20141024/228556/On_the_Thought_of_Flow_Theory.php" rel="nofollow">first linked article</a>.\n<blockquote>One thing that can be done is by seeing what happened inside player mind when they confront a challenge. Through my little research, I found there is a pattern that always appears when people are facing a challenge. In short, there are four important components that create the pattern: expectation, doubt, reality, and relief. Expectation will lead the player to do specific curiosity, where they only use one solution that they thing as the right. However, when they are confronted with a doubt, they will see the reality and do novelty seeking, looking all available solutions. /.../ </blockquote>\n<img alt="image" src="http://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/228556/emotion%20time.jpg"/>\n<blockquote>From the graph, we can see there are two types of trend. First, an upward trend that starts from relief and ends with doubt. This trend is composed of expectation that leads the player to do specific curiosity. The other is the downward trend, which starts with doubt and ends with relief. In this trend, player will do novelty seeking by looking at the reality. As stated previously, in upward trend, player only focus on one solution because player believes the solution is the answer to what s/he confronts. It means in this trend player\u2019s skill is higher than the challenge that the game provides.  The opposite happens in the downward trend. In this state, player looks for all available solutions because the previous solution is not good enough. It means the challenge is greater than player\u2019s skill.<br/><br/>So, I believe this pattern is what has happened in every point in flow theory. By continuously interchanging between two situations that are depicted in those two trends, it will help the player to become better (by giving a greater challenge than player\u2019s current skill). Also, it provides feeling of achievement and empowerment (by giving a challenge that player can finish by player\u2019s current skill).</blockquote>\nNow tell me that this graph about emotions in a constantly escalating curve doesn't look <i>exactly like</i> the dramaturgic curve. When I read "relief", "expectations" and "doubt", I think of the beginning of Dan Harmon's simplified version of the monomyth: <a href="http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit" rel="nofollow">The Story Circle</a>.\n<blockquote>     A character is in a zone of comfort, [relief]<br/>    But they want something. [expectation]<br/>    They enter an unfamiliar situation, [doubt]<br/>...<br/></blockquote>\nRizky Winanda <a href="http://questandquestion.blogspot.se/2014/10/archetypes-life-and-games.html" rel="nofollow">continues</a> with applying this graph to the flow graph ...<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sA4Tn67wTL8/VD3HH5PnCyI/AAAAAAAAAII/PIHe-gpnHCI/s1600/conclusion%2Barchetype%2Bpic.png" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sA4Tn67wTL8/VD3HH5PnCyI/AAAAAAAAAII/PIHe-gpnHCI/s1600/conclusion%2Barchetype%2Bpic.png"/></a>... and flow finally makes sense to me. It's a constant cycle based on emotions. It's something built into our human psyche. The escalation is basically an updated (game) state, which also brings <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/422143/#Comment_422143" rel="nofollow">uncertainty</a> (LeBlanc) to the activity. If we constantly escalate, then we can still take what happens in the past into account but it wont be of as much importance compared to what lies in the future.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440935/#Comment_440935" name="Item_184" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-16T13:19:57+00:00" title="December 16, 2014  1:19PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +100<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440955/#Comment_440955" name="Item_185" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-17T18:01:33+00:00" title="December 17, 2014  6:01PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 21, 2014 3:21PM by Rickard.">edited December 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<h3>The Heuristic Spiral</h3>\n<blockquote>define: heuristic (Google)<br/><br/><b>\u02cchj\u028a(\u0259)\u02c8r\u026ast\u026ak/</b><br/><br/><i>adjective</i><br/>    1.<br/>    enabling a person to discover or learn something for themselves.<br/>    "a \u2018hands-on\u2019 or interactive heuristic approach to learning"<br/>     /.../        <br/><i>noun</i>    1.<br/>    a heuristic process or method.</blockquote>\nI've been talking for six months about how gameplay are based around feedback loops, and how interaction is nothing more than responses between at least two game elements (participants, game mechanics). What I left out, mostly to make it comprehensible, is the constant escalation that occurs. The feedback from the exchange will add another layer for the next time the player enters the same procedure. So when I was talking about feedback loops, I merely talked about one specific happening in a process.<br/><br/>As we can tell from the graph above of how flow is reached, we can see that the player learns more and more over time. So the feedback loop is not circular at all\u2014it's an up going spiral.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://erebaltor.se/rickard/utmaning_immersion.png"/><br/><i>This is an image from when I talked about how  immersion is reached.</i><br/><br/>I'm not the first to realize this. The feedback loop was theorized by Martin Heidegger back in 1927 in what he called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutic_circle" rel="nofollow">the hermeneutic circle</a>. Hermeneutic means basically \xbbconcerning interpretation\xab. This was then taken further by other people, but it wasn't until Bernard Perron did the same thing I did\u2014to take different perspectives and put them together\u2014that the circle became a spiral. Below is his representation of the feedback loop; the one specific procedure in a whole process. At the moment, the only important part for this post is how the interaction occurs with the player making input and then processes the output.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://gamestudies.org/articleimages/139_Figure_3_perron2006.jpg"/><br/>(<a href="http://gamestudies.org/1401/articles/dor" rel="nofollow">source</a>)<br/><br/>This circular exchange then included the constant escalation, due to more and more information, and it became the heuristic spiral. What's interesting is that he talks about three types of spirals:<br/>\xd7 Heuristic spiral of gameplay. Understanding the result of the gameplay.<br/>\xd7 Heuristic spiral of narrative. Understanding the fiction that most games have.<br/>\xd7 Hermeneutic spiral. Understanding the underlying meaning of the game.<br/><br/>What's interesting about this is that it correlates somewhat to three of my WHATs: Structures, Fiction, and Meaning. The two missing are Group and Setting. So either I found two more spirals by taking in other kinds of sources than him, or two or my categories are pointless.<br/><br/>There is more to talk about this, but I will leave it for later. The information I got is taken from <i>The Video Game Theory Reader 2</i>, In the Frame of the Magic Cycle (Chapter 6, p. 109-132) by Dominic Arsenault and Bernard Perron.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli" title="davidepignedoli"><img alt="davidepignedoli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli">davidepignedoli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440958/#Comment_440958" name="Item_186" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-18T14:37:54+00:00" title="December 18, 2014  2:37PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I got in touch with <a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a> and we were chatting about this topic - and he asked me to post this publicly.<br/>We mentioned chess - not an RPG, but a game that really fits a lot of these descriptions - it's almost as 'free' as an RPG (as in a higher number of variants than a boardgame for example) - but it has an incredible learning curve, an engaging system...<br/><br/>The reason I mentioned chess is because it has some interesting concepts that can be - I believe - analyzed also in the prospective of an RPG...<br/>Here's the idea: of course there is the emergent complexity of the game of chess, but there are a few additional interesting concepts in a chess game, that I'd love to find a way to express in RPG game design, so that the RPG game itself would feel somehow similar to chess.<br/><br/>For example - the rules are apparently simple, but as we said, with a tremendous amount of potential complexity because of the "situations" (using an RPG term) that will arise (namely, the various game openings, the development of the pieces on the board, and the knowledge of the players, etc., that make each game unique).<br/><br/>Another example: all pieces start as "protected": all the pawns are protected by major pieces, and all major pieces are behind pawns, so that nothing is vulnerable at the start. But you "must" move. <br/>You cannot just "pass" - something has to happen every time. In an RPG - as Vincent puts it in AW, which captures this important advice - "there is no status quo".<br/>For the fiction, this is great. Status quo is bad - in movies, books, and RPGs... It is difficult to put in motion - while forcing players to take action, to have no "pass" option, is great.<br/><br/>So the story (the game) starts balanced and with all pieces protected, but with each move, stuff happen.<br/><br/>You move a piece in chess: you threaten another piece, you move to a better position, you control some squares, you try to get the center of the board for you and so on.<br/>By moving, you always "expose" something, you always take a risk. Actions can go bad, in RPGs, and this leads the fiction in the direction you didn't hope for... but that's what makes the game interesting.<br/>You move a piece forward, you take a risk, the configuration on the board is different - you take a risk to achieve something.<br/><br/>I look at the pawns as the "fiction": they can only advance, they signal a commitment - you cannot move backwards; and I look at the major pieces as the players' capabilities to support that fiction - you need the major pieces backing up the advancing pawns, or your attempt to push the fiction will backfire...<br/><br/>(and perhaps, more to follow..)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440992/#Comment_440992" name="Item_187" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-21T13:54:15+00:00" title="December 21, 2014  1:54PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 2, 2015 11:21PM by Rickard.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<h3>About Producing Stories</h3>\nThere have been countless of debates around games and if they should be considered art or not. The Supreme Court of the United States stated in 2011 that games are to be considered art from a legal viewpoint. I would say that there are no finite answers about this controversial topic. Chris Bateman discusses over <a href="http://blog.ihobo.com/2011/11/stories-and-games-1-art.html" rel="nofollow">at his blog</a> that games are art because they produce fiction.\n<blockquote>Every game tells a story. It may not be a good story - Pac-man's eternal quest to eat all the pac-dots and avoid the ghosts except when hopped up on power pills is hardly a candidate for adaptation to a book or film, but it is still a story. <br/><br/>/.../<br/><br/>Yet paintings also have rules to them \u2013 in the case of the Hay Wain it is a tacit rule of appreciating this and many other paintings that the paint on the canvas is a depiction of something, such that when we look at the Hay Wain we see a cart at the river, not a set of coloured paint splotches.<br/><br/>/.../<br/><br/>All representative art (which is most of, although not quite all, the things we consider art) involves this prescription to imagine.</blockquote>\nLets say that we assume that this is right, and it does makes sense if I think of games like chess or Monopoly. But what about poker? Perhaps the original background of why poker exist is lost? Perhaps we can create our own stories in retrospective to make this assumptions true\u2014that games are art because they produce, or is based around, fiction? We can glue on a story that the game that it's about the constant struggle of prospectors searching for gold.<br/><br/>Because that's one way of understanding something: to put it in a context.<br/><br/>If a game manual describes how a player would do something, it will be easier for the reader to understand the procedure if that fictive player's name is Hannah. It's easier to picture Hannah in a situation than a faceless character named "player".<br/><br/>We take pride in that our hobby produces stories but I wonder if it's really that unique. The only thing that differs is the form in HOW we produce it. We got a form of interactivity (which is what <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/422235/#Comment_422235" rel="nofollow">decision-making</a> is all about) that no other medium can achieve.<br/><br/><b>Fiction-descriptive Mechanics</b><br/>If I take this one step further: if we create a story automatically from what we do in order to understand the task, couldn't we use this to create games that produces fiction? Some would probably object and say that we're already doing this. I'm saying that we're not using the right tools or mindset for it.<br/><br/>When it comes to fortune-in-the-middle, where you 1) made all the calculations and modifications of the roll, 2) made the roll, and 3) used the result to describe what happened, there was a discussion around how the descriptions the player did never had any impact\u2014it was merely a flavor to add. If you rolled the dice and described the result, then it wouldn't matter if you shot someone in the head or kicked Hannah to the moon. What some people came up with was "...with teeth" to create a decision after the roll and make the fiction more valuable. This is the wrong mindset.<br/><br/>What I propose is to create a distance between fiction and rules that must be filled with the players' descriptions. I propose that we can create a rule set that wont make any sense unless we put it into fiction. A rule set that is explained by putting it in a context. Very few roleplaying games do this today.<br/><br/>There is a fiction going on in Monopoly that is described through the game mechanics. You buy estates and you use resources that looks like money. A similar fiction-descriptive mechanic, in roleplaying games, can be seen in skills. If you got Lockpick, the skill itself describes what will happen so the player doesn't need to fill it out with a description. This is what I mean when I say that we probably have the wrong mindset when it comes to designing roleplaying games that focuses on producing fiction. What we should put effort in is to create game mechanics that <i>must be described in the fiction</i> for them to make sense.<br/><br/>If we want the players to produce the stories themselves, we should avoid fiction-descriptive mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440994/#Comment_440994" name="Item_188" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-21T17:16:17+00:00" title="December 21, 2014  5:16PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 2, 2015 11:26PM by Rickard.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like your whole post and I will mostly share what I thought when I read this.\n<blockquote>Another example: all pieces start as "protected": all the pawns are protected by major pieces, and all major pieces are behind pawns, so that nothing is vulnerable at the start.</blockquote>\nBernad Perron talks about this in the essay  <i>In the Frame of the Magic Cycle</i>.

So this is a vague area, but what's not vague is the measures that can be used to invoke emotions.<br/><br/>That's why I got the WHYs; the five broad categories Expression, Competition, Sensation, Exploration, and Destruction that tells us why someone would like to engage in our game. I'm not interested in describing them in great detail because they are such wide aspects that if I started to narrow them down, I would surely leave out some aspects of that WHY. These are more influences to awaken thought into the designers mind, when s/he combines them with the five WHATs: Meaning, Group, Structures, Fiction, and Setting. How would that look like?<br/><br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-gaZDLOAg_Po?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaZDLOAg_Po"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/gaZDLOAg_Po/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span>\n<blockquote>"The criteria for constructive emotional engagement is that it furthers collaboration and cooperation with that person, and as a benefit to a wider society."

Start With Why is a book about marketing\u2014about selling ideas\u2014by using the basic foundation of how the human psyche works.\n<blockquote>No matter your definition of success /.../ how we go about achieving our goals is very similar. Some of us just wing it, but most of us try to at least gather some data so we can make educated decisions. /.../ Whatever the result, we make decisions based on a perception of the world that may not, in fact, be completely accurate.<br/><br/>/.../<br/><br/>There are times in which we had no data or we chose to ignore the advice or information at hand and just went with our gut and things worked out just fine, sometimes even better than expected. This dance between gut and rational decision-making pretty much covers how we conduct business and even live our lives.<div>p. 12, 14</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote>The newest area of the brain, our <i>Homo sapien</i> brain, is the neocortex, which corresponds with the WHAT level. The neocortex is responsible for rational and analytical thought and language.<br/><br/>The middle two sections comprise the limbic brain. The limbic brain is responsible for all our feelings, such as trust and loyalty. It is also responsible for all human behavior and all our decision-making, but it has no capacity for language.<br/><br/>When we communicate from the outside in, when we communicate WHAT we do first, yes, people can understand vast amount of complicated information, like facts and features, but it does not drive behavior. But when we communicate from the inside out, we're talking directly to the part of the brain that controls decision-making, and our language part of the brain allows us to rationalize those decisions.<br/><br/>The part of the brain that controls our feelings has no capacity for language. It is this disconnection that makes putting our feelings into words so hard.p. 55-56</blockquote>\nWHAT you do is pretty established.<br/><br/>HOW you should do it is also easy to understand.<br/><br/>WHY you do it is harder to explain.  It's the WHY that makes people interested. It's what drives our decision-making.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.einsteinssecret.net/2013/09/05/what-is-your-why/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.einsteinssecret.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screenshot_090513_110135_PM.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>The brain is a complex thing and simply point at areas a say that "this part is responsible for [this] and that part for [that]" is always a gross simplification. But why I bring this up is because the emotions are part of why we make a decision. I'm currently reading (title translated from Swedish) <i>Emotions and Convictions - how feelings affects our thoughts</i> and one thing that stood out was that if we perceive a person doing remarkable deeds, we will start thinking of that person as remarkable. This might seem obvious, but here is the same thing in a different light (my interpretation): we like being acknowledged for our deeds. Getting praise or having someone use what you created is being acknowledged. <i>Being acknowledged is enjoyable</i>, and by getting enjoyable feedback related to the task, we think of the task we did to get that response as enjoyable.<br/><br/>This is why I talk so much about interaction cycles, or feedback loops, as I also have called them. <i>Another way of feeling enjoyment</i> is by learning from the task. To later be able to master the task. A complex task is enjoyable because you can learn to decipher it. Games that are easy to understand becomes boring more quickly because the feedback loop will die out due to the fact that you wont learn anything new from the game after a while.\n<blockquote>The power of the limbic brain is astounding. It not only controls our gut decisions, but it can influence us to do things that seem illogical or irrational. /.../ It's not logic or facts but our hopes and dreams, our heart and our guts, that drives us to try new things.<div>p. 62</div></blockquote>\nTo be able to understand a whole picture, you must know what you're fighting for. Knowing WHY is also a chance for you to bound with the product; to show others how you are as an individual by playing that game. In the gaming community, we look at a <b>Vampire</b> player in a different way than someone who is fond of <b>Sorcerer</b>, because their games expresses different WHYs despite both saying that they are focusing on \xbbstorytelling\xab.<br/><br/>It might seem like I'm only talking about a product and making people buy that certain product, but the same thing goes with a rule system and explaining it. Begin with the WHY, follow up with HOW you play, and end with WHAT you use to play with. This goes for an overall arc as well as in individual chapters of the roleplaying book.<br/><br/>Board game manuals are excellent at this. Read any board game manual, and you will see that the rule explanation begins with how you win the game. Board games has an advantage, because in almost all board games there is a competitive component. The designer doesn't need to explain WHY to play the game, because that is assumed as soon as you pick up that type of game. The only thing necessary is to explain the WHY within the gameplay - how a player can win. Tabletop roleplaying games doesn't have this luxury because we got several ways of why we want to play it, and there are also seldom a win, or end, condition. Perhaps the latter is something we should be better at incorporating?\n<blockquote>In nearly every case of a person or an organization that has gone on to inspire people and do great things, there exist this special partnership between WHY and HOW. Bill Gates, for example, may have been the visionary who imagined a world with a PC on every desk, but Paul Allen built the company. /.../ <br/><br/>This relationship starts to clarify the difference between a vision statement and a mission statement in an organization. The vision is the public statement of the founder's intent, WHY the company exist /.../ The mission statement is a description of the route,<div>p. 142</div></blockquote>\nBy the way: I need someone who takes care of the marketing and distribution for <i>This is  Pulp</i>. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>But again, if I compare this to a rule system. The WHY gives the broad perspective of what we're trying to accomplish. The HOW is the structure of play / gameplay. Very few roleplaying games explains either. They only focuses on WHAT, like character generation and dice rolling. The only thing that somewhat explains the HOW is adventure creation. I miss a <i>clear </i>structure of play in 98 % of all roleplaying games. You can probably find it in a majority of roleplaying games, but you have to cut and paste something together by analyzing different parts of the game text.<br/><br/>This is why I think Forge games were so hard to understand at the beginning: the designers were used to how traditional roleplaying games were written and imitated that, and because the structure of play were missing in those games, the new storytelling games lacked it as well. That's why I have to read obscure blog posts to be able to play <b>In a Wicked Age</b> properly, and why there sometimes pops up threads on this forum that asks how a game should be played.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441768/#Comment_441768" name="Item_193" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-20T16:27:34+00:00" title="January 20, 2015  4:27PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 26, 2015 5:15AM by Rickard.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Emotions Steer our Perception</b><br/><i>Emotions and Convictions - how feelings affect our thoughts</i> is a collection of essays about ... well, what the title says. The following is quoted from Convictions Through Emotions by Nico Frijda and Batja Mequita. It's translated to Swedish and it's me who translated the text to English.\n<blockquote>Conceptions are part of emotions. They are part of the emotional experiences because they are the meaning that are connected to the event. /.../ These conceptions form, together with the accompanying emotions of anger and enjoyment, a lot of the person's emotionally experiences.<br/><br/>In such experience the conception is projected on the object or event as an attribute belonging to the object/event. One perceive wonderful and beautiful people, not people who awaken emotions of enjoyment and happiness. Sacred words are heard and read as reverend, and doesn't pass for words that give reverend. /.../ We also feel that prophets and political leaders evoke admiration because they are admirable, and not the other way around.<br/>p. 76</blockquote>\nSo a game is fun because it awakens the emotions of "fun". How are these emotions created? Theory of Fun says it comes from learning. Flow state from skill mastery. Uncertainty in Games from anticipating but never be sure of what to expect. Understanding Comics that it comes from expressing yourself, finding discoveries, and exercising the mind and body. Other sources, can't recall which ones now, say it comes from understanding complex things, like puzzles or emergent behavior. One category of Bartley's player types wants to beat others.<br/><br/>I say that they are all right, but from different perspectives. Some are right in some cases, others are more broad and fit on everything, some are categories the other suggestions.\n<blockquote>Conceptions are the result of an assessment processes which either include activation of already existing conceptions relevant for the event, or creating new conceptionsabout the meaning of the event. In other words, the perception is part of the core of the emotion that sometimes have been created long before. To ride the city bus without a ticket and see the conductor will activate the already excising perception that you now will loose its face as well as money. /.../<br/><br/>These perceptions that have been created on the spot are basically transient. They are created in the moment as a consequence of how an event is assessed. They are part of the emotional response. You get mad on the conductor because you feel that you are caught. /.../ If you are in love, you think the object for the love is beautiful and attractive. /.../ During a matrimonial argument, you can start question what you once saw in your spouse. But these perceptions are often transient and last only as long as the emotion. When the emotion is over, the perception fades. The experience of beauty and attraction usually goes away when love fades. The same mechanic can make you, after an intercourse, to vainly find the attractiveness in the partner that you had when you felt lust. /.../ After an argument you can be astounded by the evil words you thought and said to your spouse.<br/>p. 77</blockquote>\nThis brings me back to what <a href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli">@davidepignedoli</a> said earlier and my response to him.\n<blockquote>Another example: all pieces start as "protected": all the pawns are protected by major pieces, and all major pieces are behind pawns, so that nothing is vulnerable at the start.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Bernad Perron talks about this in the essay In the Frame of the Magic Cycle. That the game starts with the player knowing about the game and then uses that information to make a move. </blockquote>\nIt also makes me think about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Circle_%28virtual_worlds%29#Origin_of_the_term" rel="nofollow">Huizinga\u2019s magic circle</a>, where gameplay forms a protected circle, and things that happen in that circle stays in that circle. You can be vicious opponents trying to kill each other in the game but, when the game ends, you go back to be the childhood friends that you have always been.<br/><br/>An emotional response is built up by anticipation and it normally fades quickly after the event, and leave reflection over what has happened. A reflected of WHAT and HOW it happened "tainted" by the emotion. <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/437951/#Comment_437951" rel="nofollow">Why do we want dice in roleplaying games</a>? Is it because it's "fun to roll dice" or lies the answer somewhere else, not affected by the emotion triggered by the dice rolling?\n<blockquote>The conceptions that are built up within the emotions can go further than being emotional impressions (beauty, discomfort, frighting, big, fault) to transit to perceptions about real attributes. The conceptions can even become the foundation for development of the awaken emotion. /.../ Constructions of emotions can be even more far-reaching.<br/><br/>Many perceptions have been created to fill out the image of an emotional situation. Other have been built up as justifications or explanations of the emotional assessment. All pain or discomfort may lead to blaming someone or something. [banging the head in a shelf makes you angry on the shelf. From an earlier example.] /.../<br/><br/>Of these developments of perceptions, it's clear that emotions often aren't immediate responses on previous perceptions or conceptions. They are usually processes over an amount of time, part of cycles of information that creates emotional responses that creates new information, and so on.<br/>p. 77-78</blockquote>\nWhen talking about the major dramatic curve and how it was related to flow, I made this bold statement: "It's a constant cycle based on emotions. It's something built into our human psyche."<br/><br/>I made that statement because of what I read in the quote above. We still don't know <i>why</i> it escalates, and I have earlier said that escalation is part of creating uncertainty, and uncertainty is what makes us curious. We don't know why, but it's there.<br/><br/>One thesis is that the escalation is based on how the brain stores information with nodes and relations between the nodes. Whenever information is created, a node is created that with relations to other nodes, and the more that information is used, the larger the relations become. It still don't explain what an emotion is; all we noticed is that they are responses to something we learned/perceived.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442000/#Comment_442000" name="Item_194" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-25T18:10:47+00:00" title="January 25, 2015  6:10PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 26, 2015 5:19AM by Rickard.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In one of the first posts in this thread, I talked about what a system consist of. In roleplaying games, we use "rule system" as a term for \xbba collection of rules\xab but I would like to point to another usage of the word "system" to help forming a game designer's mind; to help set a direction at the very start of creating a game. This time, I will use the words of Eric Zimmerman from <i>The Video Game Theory Reader 2</i> in his essay Gaming Literacy: Game Design as a Model for Literacy in the Twenty-First Century.\n<blockquote><b>Systems</b><br/>To paraphrase contemporary communication theory, a system is a set of parts that interrelates to form a whole. Almost anything can be considered a system, from biological and physical systems to social and cultural systems. Having a systems point of view /.../ means understanding the world as dynamic sets of parts with complex, constantly changing interrelationships\u2014seeing the structures that underlie our world, and comprehending how these structures function. /.../<br/><br/>System-based thinking is about process, not answers. It stresses the importance of dynamic relationships, not fixed facts. Getting to know a system requires understanding it on several levels, ...<br/>p. 25</blockquote>\nI will extract some parts from the quote:<br/><br/><i>a set of parts that interrelates to form a whole<br/><br/>dynamic<br/><br/>changing<br/><br/>process</i><br/><br/>Emergence is the result of several parts <b>interacting</b>. Emergence is hard to predict, which makes it interesting. What intrigues us with the system is the <b>dynamic</b> that is created. Jim Butcher talks about the aftereffects of conflict in stories, and how they really are the interesting part because they are the consequences of the conflict. The conflict brings uncertainty but it's the consequences that create the feeling of <b>change</b>. Change is what keeps up the interest in the long run. We need to understand that what we create, in a game, is an ever-changing <b>process</b>, consisting of these parts that interacts with each other, instead of a collection of individual statements which roleplaying game mechanics have a habit to turn into.<br/><br/>I will talk more about processes when I find a decent video with Edward de Bono.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444765/#Comment_444765" name="Item_195" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-12T15:57:12+00:00" title="April 12, 2015  3:57PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 14, 2015 4:04PM by Rickard.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<h4>The Designer's Goal Should Be Part of the Participants' Interaction</h4>\nIn the game <b>Svart av kval, vit av lust</b> (Black of Despair, White of Lust), participants play intriguing vampires with their own personal agendas. The conflict resolution system is based on a hierarchy. A vampire hunter will always win over the elderly vampire, whom will always win over the younger vampire. At any conflict, the vampire can unleash The Beast within, and The Beast is on top of the hierarchy.\n<blockquote>The Beast &gt; Elderly vampire &gt; Younger vampire</blockquote>\nDuring the course of the game, other participants (it's a GM-free game) can impose The Beast's impulses; to feed, to be violent, to have sex, to humiliate the human side of the vampire. If the player wants to resist, that player will get a token. During conflict, if The Beast is released, any participant can take a token and tell the one who unleashed The Beast that the animal refusing helping. A refusing Beast is at the lowest point on the hierarchy.\n<blockquote>The Beast &gt; Elderly vampire &gt; Younger vampire &gt; Refusing beast</blockquote>\nWhile playing the game, the elders can do whatever they want with the younger vampires, unless the younger ones use their Beasts. This mean that they must follow The Beast's impulses in any scene before that, to avoid having the Beast refusing helping out. The game is set up so the vampires will be tested through the impulses first, and then the fiction escalates to be about the vampires' goals.<br/><br/>What the game is designed for is so that the younger vampires must walk on a path of destruction (to overcome the elderly vampires) if they want to achieve their goals. In other words, <i>the game designer's goal is NOT the same thing as the participants' goals</i>, but is instead part of the interaction between the players or the game components.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-VeqDSNd22Zk/VSZN0PJCbxI/AAAAAAAAAXE/Q8Hr_rY_HCk/w382-h257/differentGoals.png"/><br/>(I really hope you can see the picture above)<br/><br/>This might sound obvious, but what I feel is the <i>opposite</i> to this is design-through-rewards, where you get a tangible/extrinsic reward for doing a certain task. "Gain 1 XP if you walk on the path of destruction". Luke Crane is the perfect example of someone who designs games like this, and I can't really stress enough how bad that kind of design is, where the game designer's goal is the same thing as the participants. <br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>Because extrinsic rewards doesn't have anything to do with the actual task.<br/>- The feedback from the task, the tangible reward, is not related in any way to what the player is doing.<br/>- The non-related feedback can steer away the attention to what the activity is about, and instead only be about the reward.<br/>- Scientific studies have shown that focusing on the outcome (the reward in this case), instead of the steps to achieve it, will decrease the <i>intrinsic </i>motivation.<br/><br/>Is it good game design if the players do what you want them to do, without having to concern about if they think the activity is fun in the first place? (The sad thing is that this is a widely accepted game design philosophy when it comes to roleplaying games.)<br/><br/>I prefer when a) what the game designer wants the game to be about is a natural part of the process of the game (the actual interaction), and b) when the feedback is related to the task. I will talk more about why a) and b) is important in the next posts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli" title="davidepignedoli"><img alt="davidepignedoli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli">davidepignedoli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444777/#Comment_444777" name="Item_196" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-13T11:28:05+00:00" title="April 13, 2015 11:28AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Again I want to thank you for you useful insights.<br/><br/>I have a question regarding the picture in your post, where the designer goal meets the players interaction. Do you think this the same (or somehow similar) to the principles discussed by Vincent Baker for example, where he says that as a designer <i>one should first of all think of which conversation he wants players to have at the table</i>?<br/>In other words, if I design a game, my goal as the designer is not for example to encourage the player playing the thief to be dishonest, but rather to provide the player with the thief character certain interesting options, which would reasonably spring some conversation lines from his side that would lead to a 'dishonest' character.. <br/>Am I saying this correctly?<br/><br/>Let me try again.<br/>Bad Design for a thief character: <i>when you steal gold coins from the treasure, at the expense of your companions, mark 1 XP</i> <br/>This is the 'bad' design you're talking about, correct? Where as designer I hand you over an XP (or whatever reward) for doing something with your character.<br/><br/><b>But how does the better design look like?</b><br/><br/>Let me try (let's stay in the classic D&amp;D/OSR style with a thief and a fighter): <br/>- what if I make a <i>thief playbook</i> which has the option to steal efficiently <br/>- AND that will level-up every X gold coins taken from treasures or companions<br/>- AND make each level-up harder to reach for the thief (thus the thief needs more gold than what his reasonable share would provide)<br/>does it achieve, you think, a better result?<br/><br/>What if my dungeons all give treasures using odd or prime numbers like 7 gold coins, 11 gold coins? (that's hard to split in an even way)<br/><br/>Still in the same game, if I make a fighter character and say "<i>when you deal harm to one of your companions, mark XP</i>" that's bad design.<br/><br/>But if make a move like: <i>when you fight, you deal 1D6-harm; if you have "blind-fury" deal 2D6-harm, but also 1-harm to companions next to you</i>.<br/>And then: <i>you enter blind-fury when a) you're Wounded or Critically Wounded, b) they've insulted your mum, c) you've harmed a companion in your previous fight</i>, is this better?<br/>(plus once the fighter enters 'blind-fury' mode, he always harms companions if they stay close to him in a fight, thus triggers the move for the next fight over and over)<br/><br/>I find your posts extremely useful and interesting, but I find myself falling back into the "do this and take 1 XP" design more than I'd like to.<br/>I think this design ("do this and take 1 XP") is not absolutely bad - when it deals with traditional players it is pushing them to explore different things and does it 'openly' and in a very 'honest' way: you read the character sheet and you know where it's going to take you.<br/><br/><i>But I feel like it's a very 'lazy' design </i> (without meaning to insult anyone) and leave very little space for surprises: I find it beautiful when I pick a character and little by little it takes me to places I didn't expect - and places that I am maybe even a bit uncomfortable with... <br/>This cannot happen with the "do this and take 1 XP".<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444778/#Comment_444778" name="Item_197" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-13T12:47:42+00:00" title="April 13, 2015 12:47PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2015 4:05PM by Rickard.">edited June 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm too falling back on using design through (tangible) rewards, and it's because I've been taught that from other roleplaying games. It sounds true what Vincent Baker is saying about how the game is a conversation and that the game designer should decide what it should be about. The principle is simple: create <i>emergence</i>, meaning different parts interacting with each other. The chess pieces on the board are different parts that will interact with each other, but you need the parts to adopt their interaction with several other parts.<br/><br/>We had a really cool thing happening in <b>Mouse Guard</b> once, where the group met a snake. Kenzie had an insight that said "Always consult Saxon when trouble arises.", and when the player of Saxon looked at his character sheet, the insight said "Always draw my sword at the first sign of trouble.". That was a great dependency but the trouble it is only an dependency to one and only one part. If this would happen again, the same thing would arise.<br/><br/>The board game <b>Pandemic</b> has characters with unique powers. The medic can, for example decrease the presence of a decease from a town and, if they got the cure, remove it entirely. Another character can move other characters in its turn, meaning that the medic can move over great distances. A third character can reuse action cards, which can be combined with other powers. All these can work together in different ways, and will do that because of all the different situations that will occur on the game board.<br/><br/>That's one way of designing interaction. Another way is to require something from the players. If they got a skill called Convince, one requirement could be to always use the sword (like Saxon), but another character must use money instead. So every time they try to convince someone, they have to include that requirement. You can expand this to have "violence", "sex", "money" as requirements, and then have skills like Convince, Finding Rumors, and Acquiring Items. Each one will have their own consequence in the game world of how the character is using it. Is Convincing + Sex appropriate for the prince or should he use Violence instead? The Money will end sooner or later.<br/><br/>(To make it more complicated.) Do note that I'm not always against extrinsic motivations like tangible rewards (XP, loot, bonuses) but it needs to give a <i>permanent </i>effect and also feed back to the activity so it forms a loop. Slaying monster -&gt; getting XP -&gt; getting better -&gt; slaying bigger monsters, is a perfectly fine loop to me. Slaying monsters -&gt; getting XP -&gt; becoming more convincing, is instead a broken loop.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444799/#Comment_444799" name="Item_198" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-14T16:25:39+00:00" title="April 14, 2015  4:25PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 19, 2015 4:57AM by Rickard.">edited June 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Copy pasted from my <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/collections" rel="nofollow">G+ page</a> where I talk about game design.)<br/><br/>\n<h4>The Pitch is an Important Part of Your Game</h4>\nNicole Lazarro is using her four keys of fun - people fun, hard fun, easy fun, and serious fun - to broaden games to attract more people. Are your game lacking the social bit? Try to implement more of that to appeal to a larger audience. This is good and all if you want to think commercially, mostly if you're in the AAA business ... or, in the tabletop roleplaying world, making Dungeons and Dragons.<br/><br/>I don't believe in making games that appeal to everyone, because it's my opinion that that kind of thinking is watering down the experience for all users. Create something powerful for one group of players - it can be a beautiful game, a philosophical thought, a strategic experience - and focus on pulling in just the right players.<br/><br/>Through the pitch of your game, and even the cover, you can create expectations from the players. You can make them adapt their way of thinking to easier understand the gameplay, or accept the premise of the game. A rouge-like game, or a storytelling game, is very different from an educational game or a traditional roleplaying game.<br/><br/>I would even go so far to say that <i>the pitch is a part of your game system</i>, because of the impact it will have on your players (that is, if they haven't got the hands on the game through other sources than you, like friends' recommendations or reading reviews). To write a really good pitch, you need to create curiosity so that the reader wants to know more, and you want to make it appealing for your target audience and make people realize what kind of game it is.<br/><br/>I had people that didn't like the pitch for one of my games because they didn't like that kind of game style. That was a great feedback for me, because I don't want everyone to play that game. I want the players with a particular playstyle to play it.<br/><br/>If you want advice to how to think when creating a pitch, check out the following article and video. Both are about leaving the mechanical behind (WHAT) and focus more on WHY to play the game.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/PeterAngstadt/20150203/235644/How_to_Make_Your_Pitch_Resonate.php" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/PeterAngstadt/20150203/235644/How_to_Make_Your_Pitch_Resonate.php</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444810/#Comment_444810" name="Item_199" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-15T15:35:29+00:00" title="April 15, 2015  3:35PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've linked to Extra Credits before and when they talked about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWtvrPTbQ_c" rel="nofollow">Skinner box</a>; using rewards as an extrinsic motivator for certain actions.
