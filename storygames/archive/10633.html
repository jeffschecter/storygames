I volunteered to DM it, anticipating a group of 3-4.  <br/><br/>But then everyone's spouses got interested too, and the group doubled in size.<br/><br/>Yikes!  I said.  I explained how complex 4E could be and offered to run Barbarians of Lemuria, a much, much, much simpler game.  I can improvise a storyline around BoL, find where the energy is, and pursue it and in general be more confident of a successful evening.  And with the simple character creation, we could actually make characters in a few minutes and everyone would have a bit more ownership of the experience.  But alas, the D&amp;D brand has peculiar power, and BoL has a dorky name.  So they said they'd prefer to play D&amp;D.  4E specifically.<br/><br/>Ok, I said.  D&amp;D it is.  Because I love a challenge, I'm gonna run with it.  <br/><br/>My ideas so far:<br/><br/>No character creation.  Everyone gets pregens, and I'm only going to have 3-4 different pregens, the simplest ones I can find.  Suggestions?  I'm thinking ranger, cleric, rogue, wizard -- defenders are too much about marking, and marking is a lot of state to track.  The fighter class features are a nightmare to explain to people; they are conceptually super-dense.<br/><br/>We'll have multiple copies of each pregen, so two or more people could wind up playing, for instance, a Dwarf Cleric, and they can huddle up and try to decipher their options together, while each having their own character. Maybe we can drive some family ties off this, in the fiction.<br/><br/>The group has a couple MMO gamers and some long-lapsed tabletop folks (long-lapsed =~20ish years).  Since I know nothing about their play preferences, and neither do they, I need a scenario that will be rich tactically and fictionally and which will have a minimum of pregame you-meet-in-a-tavern fumbling.  This, I think I've got covered; they'll kick off as galley slaves and be rammed by a zombie corsairs -- think Ben Hur.  (one of the players is a film buff; this is pandering to him a bit)  <br/><br/>There will be lots of things to do on the boat: rescue friends, drown enemies, kill the greedy, evil Maximum Eunuch who enslaved them, steal the treasure on the boat, dismember zombies, rescue the zoo animals in the hold, stay alive.  Whatever they engage with will become the story.  There'll be a pearl-diver island nearby for them to escape to (which will segue into the Isle of Dread if there's time) or maybe they kill everyone and keep the ship.  (but who rows?)  Maybe I'll have a "boat-is-sinking" countdown to add some urgency to the proceedings.<br/><br/>I'll need to avoid narrow passageways on the battlemat so we don't have any bottlenecks to movement.  This will be the most cathedral-like galley ever sketched on a 1" grid.<br/><br/>I also need to avoid victory conditions and dead ends.  Whatever they engage on the boat has to lead to fun.  If they ignore some part of it, like say they don't hack up any zombies, that can't just mean that they lose and the fun's over.<br/><br/>Anyone got any other teaching D&amp;D tips?  Please don't tell me to simplify the game; I haven't got time to slice and dice the ruleset.  The One Bad Egg zero-level D&amp;D might be an option since that only subtracts stuff from characters, not from the ruleset.  Assume that the game will be played RaW and that we have 4 hours for our first session.  Also, disinviting / disincluding people is not an option, and neither is not having fun.  This is my art, and I want to represent it well to people who are dear to me.  <br/><br/>If it were easy, everyone would do it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235761/#Comment_235761" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-05T13:56:14+00:00" title="October  5, 2009  1:56PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Download the free H1 Keep on the Shadowfell thing off the D&amp;D website.

It shouldn't be at all hard to buff the encounters to make them suitable for that many PCs; all you need to do is notice what the Encounter Level for a particular encounter is supposed to be, note the difference in XP between the standard party (five) and yours at that EL, and then throw in a few extra monsters from the encounter to make up the difference.<br/><br/>When you throw in extra monsters, I'd recommend that you go with a general allotment like two-thirds minions to one-third non-minions, especially with the early encounters. Minions give players quick-win satisfaction of felling an opponent. Make sure the players understand the concept of a minion (foes with the same powers as the "tough ones", but who get put out of combat quickly), and describe them to distinguish in encounters ("this bunch over here behind this boulder look like rabble; those bunch over there under the tree look a lot tougher"). When minions get put out of the fight, don't necessarily have them die, but have them become decided non-combatant (crawling away, cowering and wimpering holding their wounded limbs, desperately trying to repack their abdomens with entrails, etc), but tailor your description to the crowd.<br/><br/>In my experience, you're not going to do the party any favours if you keep the ELs of the encounters depressed (i.e. don't adjust the encounters in the adventures upwards for the added PCs), as they need to be balanced to make the party earn their victories.<br/><br/>Notice also that the big Irontooth encounter is a potential party-kill machine, and intentionally so. Prep it very carefully, and present it to the players carefully (especially if they're all RPG newbies). It's very possible for Irontooth and his buddies to make chopped meat of the party if they make even a small number of bad decisions: accordingly, it's good for Irontooth and his buddies to capture, not kill, PCs, and for rescue missions to be mounted.<br/><br/>It's also possible for PCs to rush into the Irontooth encounter without too many other encounters to prep: I'd make sure that the PCs have at least three or four other encounters under their belt first: they need to have worked through a bunch of them to start getting a solid handle on how 4e tactics work; otherwise, things won't go well for them.<br/><br/>With parties as big as seven players, you also need to figure out ways to let everyone contribute: on a side sheet of paper make a note of everyone's best skill or two, as well as their passive perception ratings etc. (If you're using pregens, this should be easy and you can do it ahead of time.) If you're using pregens, then take a few minutes to point out to each player what the "good parts" of their PCs are, and what they're good at: point out that they will also have an opportunity to switch stuff around between levels (might give them an extra thing to switch or two at the early levels to let them personalize their PCs a bit). Try to look at the first part of H1 and figure out what bits each character can be good at: extra stuff in the town, plus an interesting "hook scene" right at the start, can rope in "socially focussed" PCs to get them talking. There's opportunity for sneaking and trailing folks in the town at the start of H1.<br/><br/>The back half of H1 is pretty loaded up with tactical encounters, though, without much in the way of space to do social stuff, so make sure that the players who lean towards social stuff also learn how they can be effective in tactical encounters early on; otherwise, the back half of the adventure isn't going to hold too much interest for them, or they'll be struggling to catch up with figuring out their PC's options.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235825/#Comment_235825" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-05T21:16:41+00:00" title="October  5, 2009  9:16PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You are the ideal DM for this scenario, John, so I wouldn't sweat it too much.

H1, run as written, is tedious, abusive, and dull.  It doesn't showcase D&amp;D at all.

This is a fatal flaw, especially for a teaching text that's supposed to lure people into the game.

I'll one-click one from the Character Generator.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236170/#Comment_236170" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T13:22:26+00:00" title="October  7, 2009  1:22PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2009 1:44PM by Valamir.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's your definition of "Memorable Encounter".  That might be a key difference in perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm actually actively hostile to the crazier terrain effects and trap effects and bizarre ice bridges over molten lava geysers type of encounters.  I find those silly (and not in a good way) rather than memorable.  Probably because I like my fantasy less...fantastic.  Similarly I'd happily fight kobolds and goblins and progressively tougher humanoids and their pets for 10 levels (or zombies and skeletons for an undead campaign) rather than dip into the zany crazy monsters D&amp;D; is populated with...in H1 the encounter with those wierd bug things is at the edge of my tolerance for zany monster encounters.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat makes an encounter memorable for you that the H1's don't do?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236180/#Comment_236180" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T13:42:42+00:00" title="October  7, 2009  1:42PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>What makes an encounter memorable for you that the H1's don't do?</blockquote>Probably a hell of a cool new thread. But memorability is pretty germane to both learning AND inciting a desire to play again, so....<br><br>For me, it's something emergent from the engagement of the situation through the system; in short, something surprising. That's why a 10-level grind through (presumably very similar) monsters is bleh, to me: it is unlikely anything surprising will happen after the first couple of encounters. But ice-bridges over lava geysers might make me realize something about positioning rules... or a wicked way to use my TK ability... or just offer amusing opportunities for crits that I would never discover with "vanilla" terrain and stock beasties.<br><br>Similarly, objective-based encounters seem to stick better than "kill or retreat; here's your next hurdle" encounters. I'll remember far longer how I used an unusual combination of skill checks and resource management to AVOID a fight I will remember the umpty-million roll-offs that fight would engender, with bog-standard mooks.<br/><br/>Finally, nothing says memorable like a lasting result from the encounter. I won... but I lost a hand; NOW what? I lost... and so now I'm captured and stripped of equipment... NOW what? I won... but by routing the enemy from the field... wonder who they'll come BACK with, once they clean the stains out of their shorts? (I died, while "lasting," means "stop playing Your Guy for a while... or forever" and is, thus, a bit less interesting than a terrible consequence.)                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236199/#Comment_236199" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T14:32:46+00:00" title="October  7, 2009  2:32PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=10649" rel="nofollow">Let's talk about H1 over here.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236944/#Comment_236944" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-11T18:08:08+00:00" title="October 11, 2009  6:08PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 11, 2009 6:18PM by johnzo.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's the after-action report.<br/><br/>That thing you hear about new gamers, what a delight they are?  I totally buy that now.  <br/><br/>To get things rolling, I asked everyone why they were in the tavern, and who their worst enemies were:<br/><b>C, a human ranger</b> "I'm in the tavern seeking human contact.  I spend a lot of time alone."<br/><b>V, another human ranger</b> "My worst enemy is my daughter, who killed my husband.  I'm in the tavern because I'm hiring a dwarven bounty hunter to track her down."<br/><b>S, eladrin wizard and expert reincorporator: </b> "My worst enemy is my mother, because she does not hear the advice of my sloth, who told me to kill my father.  I'm in the tavern trying to score with human rangers because I'm have both daddy issues and mommy issues and I'm off my meds."<br/><br/>I explained beforehand that some of the game took place on this dorky square-ruled map with the dorky little action figures, and some of the game was entirely notional.  I thought this might be the hardest thing for a newbie to grok about D&amp;D, but they got it.  At times, S and V were playing an entirely different game than the rest of the table, and it was all pretty entertaining, though it wasn't the most coherent thing ever.<br/><br/>This was a validation of the encounter design -- I set my trireme up as a playground with lots of diverse things to do.  In the hold were animals and treasure and narcotics and rising water and a thumbless, affable centaur stowaway.  On the oar deck there were plenty of slaves clamoring for rescue.  On deck was a really unlikable enemy (Mophust, Eunuch By Choice and Assistant Deputy Minister of Grains and Entertainments) and his marines.  Above decks were masts, chains, talking giant buzzards, and a colossal bat who was the pirates' propulsion system.  The pirates were all over, for fighting or diplomacizin.<br/><br/>The party ignored the slaves and the diplomacy, killed the pirates and Mophust' crew, let the elephant swim off, and rescued the thumbless centaur after he showed them to the treasure and the narcotics.  Teamwork started to emerge on the battlegrid; after the dragonborn blasted much of the first wave of enemies to ash with his fire breath, they had a little healing meeting, got everyone back to nominal, and went after the second wave with murder in their eyes.<br/><br/>Two more validations: The player preference for 4E over BoL was pretty sound.  The guys who were pressing for 4E were specifically after a squares-and-figures kind of game.  We could drift 4E to do skillsy/schizo-daughter/free-narration stuff much more easily than we could drift BoL to be all tactical.  That's not to say they wouldn't have fallen in love with BoL, but their choice was an informed one.  Also I think that having duplicate characters on the table really helped open up tutoring opportunities.  The clerics wound up with a guy who'd read some stuff about 4E and with a total newbie, and the  experienced guy helped the newbie maneuver her figure.  <br/><br/>The main point of suck was that I pregenerated all the characters using WotC's software, and the power cards that thing produces have <sup><sub>tiny</sub></sup> print on them -- especially for complicated powers.  We're all in our thirties, and one of the guys couldn't read his Paladin's Divine Challenge at all.  Next time, I should figure out how to make the WotC thing print power cards at 4x6 instead of the 2x3 it uses now.<br/><br/>It was also tough working through seven-player turns.  I often offered to skip people and let them interrupt things later when they decided what to do; nobody took my up on that.  That said, our main fight went seven or eight rounds and I think we did well given the complexity of the rules, the size of the table, and the experience level of the players.<br/><br/>Thanks to everyone for their help!  We're gonna play this thing again sometime.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236947/#Comment_236947" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-11T18:18:48+00:00" title="October 11, 2009  6:18PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have everybody (no exceptions!) do a brief (i.e. 150-300 word write up) on their characters' backstories.
