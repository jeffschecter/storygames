Although they're new to TTRPG, they have all been exposed to the basic concepts of RPG through computer games.  This means it feels different to them than it did for us when we were starting out - for them it's just one more existing choice on the menu of avocations and social cliques, rather than the "cutting edge" of anything.<br/><br/>Another difference, often noted in other contexts, is that kids these days <i>do</i> seem to have shorter attention spans in general.  Personally I see ADHD as a cultural phenomena.  Perhaps an adaptation to the fast pace of information.  So in general I find you have to pull them in faster, do things in short bursts, take breaks, give them time to check their phones, etc.<br/><br/>And do they visualize less?  I kinda think maybe they do?<br/><br/>My younger daughter (age 11) usually joins in the sessions with that (edited for clarity: the early 20's) group, but it's because she likes having a reason to hang out with "the big kids".  She isn't interested in playing RPGs in other contexts - either solo or with her own peers.  "The Silver Dragon's Tear" is a neat minification and I wish I could talk her into trying it.  Or Wildlings.  Or Michtim.  (The lament of the RPG dad!)  But online games like "FeralHeart" and "Minecraft" interest her and her friends a lot more.  It's the constant visual feedback, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432254/#Comment_432254" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-07T18:49:17+00:00" title="May  7, 2014  6:49PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            AsIf,<br/><br/>It's a very interesting question whether it's the constant visual feedback/shortened attention span (you well be right here!) or just a natural range of personality types.<br/><br/>For instance, I remember trying to induct friends into gaming back before any of us had computers or video games or anything, and there were still a majority who just "didn't get it" or wouldn't bother using their imagination.

World of Dungeons is also a good bet, of course, although it's fair bit more complex and less flexible than this simpler game. (Which is just as much feature as it is bug, of course. But this game is very intentionally much less dungeon- and combat-focused.)<br/><br/>I don't think the "danger" of death is as great here as you think it is. For a character to die, first they have to be targeted in some kind of challenge where the clear danger is a lethal threat (as opposed to an injury, like a broken arm or a wounded leg, or just the opponent having the upper hand and winning the day). Then the poor character has to fail badly enough to take a serious, lethal wound. (And this could be a good point to negotiate with the player - or the MC - since you can always interpret "defeat" as something other than a potentially lethal wound!) Third, they have to roll a 6 or less on their "defeat and calamity" roll. Finally, they have to also roll a complete miss on the "recovery" move. <br/><br/>Now, let's assume that a character has already qualified for the first two conditions: they got themselves into a life-or-death situation and they managed to miss a critical roll. (And presumably didn't use the Six-Fingered Hand of Fate - thanks for the suggestion, Johnstone! <i>Inconceivable</i> that I didn't think of it immediately myself.)<br/><br/>They still have to fail their "defeat" roll AND then fail their "recovery" roll. Even if they don't have any Qualities or Implements to help them, the odds of failing both rolls are only 17%. If they have a single Quality or Implement which help them, that jumps up dramatically! (To 8% or so.)<br/><br/>That seems much better than World of Dungeons, from a survivability point of view. (World of Dungeons actually says nothing about death and survival, but it would be natural to assume that attacks deal 1d6 or 1d6+1 damage, which means that any successful attack has a 50% chance of "killing" someone, by reducing them to 0 hit points. A second hit would presumably make that even worse; whereas in Dragon's Tear it doesn't matter how many times you're "hit", only that you lost the fight.)<br/><br/>But, on top of those odds, we have the Six-Fingered Hand of Fate, which would almost certainly be used on any "recovery" roll when death was on the line! (Of course, it's possible that a player already spent all of their Hand, but in most situations I'd expect a player to have at least one reroll left over...) That improves the odds even further. (For instance, someone spending one Hand of Fate reroll on both the defeat and recovery rolls only has a 4% of dying.)<br/><br/>I hope that helps! I think you can play pretty fearlessly. And if you don't want to put death on the line, don't: make defeat just that - you lost the fight, you're captured, your nemesis got away, you're washed up on a distant shore the next morning, half-drowned, etc.<br/><br/><br/>Edit: As an aside, anyone reading through the list of names should notice that it includes references to Albi the Racist Dragon, our current D&amp;D adventures on IRC, Inigo Montoya, from the Princess Bride, and Valavanora, one of the heroes of "Dungeon Girls", which is, in turn, one of the grandest stories of playing World of Dungeons with kids you'll ever find.

They could be of use in some social interactions.<br/><br/>Implements: what about splitting more standard gear (a weapon, a shield, garb) from others more "advanced" (and limit the advanced to only 2 out of 4, or even 1 out of 4)??<br/><br/>Also, I would remove garb. It's not that picking other 4 will force you to go around naked. Maybe change it to "garb for every occasion" (i.e. this character can change from fancy to practical, can disguise...), or "superior garb" or such... I mean, otherwise people choosing it as it is now might discover in the long run that they wasted one implement... (I see a mysterious device making a difference in a certain point, but not a generic garb...)<br/><br/>Hand of Fate: the rule makes you draw boxes, and cross them off. Then you add new boxes when you pursue a passion - why not to remove the cross? Or easier yet: in the beginning write on your sheet "Hand of Fate: X X X X X X" and then erase/restore an X (a point) for using/gaining...<br/><br/>Nice work!!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432303/#Comment_432303" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-08T13:09:30+00:00" title="May  8, 2014  1:09PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good feedback, Davide, thank you.<br/><br/>I feel that many of the Qualities have to do with social action (Sage, Wise, Tough, Cunning, Sneaky, Deft, Seasoned, Quick, Learned, Wary, etc - who's to say you're not Deft with words, for example?), but I'll see if I can add a few more without over-filling the page. I hesitate with Qualities like "beautiful", because they aren't something you can generally *do* anything with, just a passive descriptor of how others perceive you.<br/><br/>As for the Hand of Fate, that's for a few reasons:<br/><br/>* Erasing can be a pain in the butt, and ruin a sheet of paper, especially when a child does it.<br/>* Some people only use pen, not pencil, and therefore don't have the option.<br/>* The growing line of boxes and crosses is this game's nod to "experience": you can look at a character sheet and see how much that character's been played ("Ooh! She's an old veteran!"), which appeals to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432310/#Comment_432310" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-08T19:10:49+00:00" title="May  8, 2014  7:10PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2014 7:13PM by Paul_T.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've updated the file with the corrections and some clarifications.<br/><br/>For now I've decided to go with three Qualities and three Implements; that seems suitably memorable.

I think a good sentence of guidance would go a long way here.<br/><br/>2) I am confused by this wording: <br/><br/>"When it causes you trouble or holds you back in a challenge, say so"<br/>- Okay, cool, I narrate an action that is bad news for me, including "I fail at this challenge".<br/><br/>"...and add another Fate box. When you do so, the GM may choose to reroll one of your dice"<br/>- Okay, what for?<br/><br/>"to see if the Weakness holds you back somehow."<br/>- Huh?  Didn't it already?  Wasn't that, in fact, the <i>requirement</i> for me getting that extra Fate box?<br/><br/>If what you really mean is, "When you do so in a challenge situation, discuss with the GM whether you automatically fail or simply roll at a penalty," then best to be explicit.<br/><br/>3) If you'd also add a short summary of the GM agenda/principles (perhaps "Be a fan of the characters, make their lives interesting, and play to find out what happens"), this would seem pretty complete to me!<br/><br/>4) I <i>love</i> that players get to define what's looking out for them.  For some reason, that inspires me more than all the Qualities, Implements and Names (though some of those Implements are great)!<br/><br/>5) If you don't feel like brainstorming Passions and Weaknesses but would consider including a list if you already had one, here:<br/><br/>PASSION (specify)<br/>Loyalty (ally)<br/>Duty (liege)<br/>Love (family)<br/>Amor (lover)<br/>Honor (code)<br/>Hate (enemy)<br/>Protection (charge)<br/>Knowledge (topic)<br/>Acquisition (object)<br/>Fame (audience)<br/>Power (type)<br/>Pleasure (type)<br/><br/>WEAKNESS<br/>Forgetful<br/>Inattentive<br/>Stupid<br/>Ignorant<br/>Gullible<br/>Delusions<br/>Dull sense (specify)<br/>Phobia (specify)<br/>Bloodthirsty<br/>Temper<br/>Compulsive gambling<br/>Foolhardy<br/>Cowardly<br/>Weak nerves<br/>Boorish<br/>Buzz-kill<br/>Paranoid<br/>Stigma (specify)<br/>Code (specify)<br/>Vulnerability (specify)<br/>Feeble<br/>Weak<br/>Bad body part (specify)<br/>Withdrawal (addiction)<br/>Hideous<br/>No physical body<br/><br/>Weakness list inspired in part by <a href="http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/img/Adv-Dis-Skills.pdf" rel="nofollow">GURPS advantages / disadvantages</a> list.

Thanks. Those are great lists! Excellent. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>The idea behind the Weakness is that we can announce it's causing you trouble, and you add a Fate box. But when you roll, the GM can reroll one of your dice. Let's say you're Lazy, and you're working on a sculpture to present to the King. You say you stay up all night, making it the best work you can! This is a challenge, so we get out the dice.<br/><br/>Now maybe you say, "Oh, but I'm Lazy, so I guess that might hold me back. I'm adding a Fate box," or maybe someone else says, "Hey, aren't you Lazy? I bet that might hold you back." (I'm thinking the player has to agree to this, so you can effectively ignore the Weakness in heroic moments or when it really counts, but at the cost of future effectiveness.) <br/><br/>Then you roll the dice, with a +1 for your Tome of the Master Sculptor, and they come up a 3 and a 6, for a total of 10+ (with your bonus from the Tome). "But!" Says the GM, "Your Laziness might set you back. I'm going to reroll that 6." And she does: the die is rerolled as a 3. Now your total is 3+3+1, or 7, so you get some kind of compromise. (If the GM had rolled a 1 or a 2, it would have been a total failure, instead.)<br/><br/>Obviously, I'll need to reword this somehow. Hmmm... (For now I've just adjusted the text very slightly.)<br/><br/>The idea is that the GM would reroll the player's highest die, and probably only if it's a 4, 5, or 6. But I thought the GM would figure that out on their own, rather than make it a rule.<br/><br/>(Part of the issue is that I'd want to fool around with this in play first, to nail down some things, like whether other players should be able to call it into play of if you should always have final say. That's why I'd left it a bit ambiguous for now.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432564/#Comment_432564" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-13T16:33:59+00:00" title="May 13, 2014  4:33PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave,<br/><br/>You've inspired me to write a "GM's Guide" for this game, based on horoscopes, of all things.

But when it comes to rolling the D6 to start the game, once I've read also the rest, I wondered if instead of leaving it to chance, you could present instead the following, to the GM:<br/><br/><i>Play begins with their first encounter, as they arrive in the place where they hope to find a warm meal. Choose one, and then make sure to bring a second into play in your first session</i><br/><br/>and then personality, tragedy, intrusion, as you listed.<br/><br/>The reason is that I believe a first session would be great at setting the ground for the adventure... <br/><br/><b>If you ask the GM to use two</b>, you open <b>combos </b>like a) the personality and the tragedy (i.e. someone important in trouble asking for help; a nemesis currently operating against innocents; someone special lost something precious, etc.) b) the personality and the evidence of the intrusion (someone important and a supernatural threat, someone special with a bond with a special creature not yet visible, a nemesis and the otherworld, be it for good or bad...) c) tragedy and evidence of the intrusion, that speaks for itself...<br/><br/>Otherwise, if you like to keep the D6 roll, then since the odds are in favor of meeting a Personality, I'd consider starting the second page with that, instead of Seeds.

Check it out - <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3720638/The%20Silver%20Dragon%27s%20Tear%20-%20alternative%20Player%20sheet.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3720638/The Silver Dragon's Tear - alternative Player sheet.pdf</a> and feel free to use it of course (I can send you the doc if you want). I thought it would be nice if the Players would read instructions then flip the page and fill it out - no need to additional paper (unless they want to do something special...). This is why I left the lists in very light gray - so the Players can overwrite them with pens...<br/><br/>Fixed two typos in it (Learned had an accent in your document - and ardor is without the "u", it's spelled ardour in your doc).<br/><br/>Back to the GM's guide: <br/><br/>As the AW's triangles (pc-npc-pc), I think here the combo could be something <b>to provide from the start</b>. When you put an NPC right there to make a triangle, it's stronger then if you form the triangle later on. So I thought: if you start with 2 out of 3, then you start with a bang!<br/><br/>I would even go further than how I presented it before... I would make 3 tables (personalities, intrusions, tragedies) and strongly recommend that the GM would start by picking or rolling for 2 of them, and do the best to bring those two in game from the very start. Like, in the very first scenes, if possible, by tying these 2 together immediately.<br/><br/>If the GM can do that, if he can fit the 2 pieces together, then there will be no Players just staring blankly at the results of a tragedy - there will be no mysterious intrusion without any hook to the story - and there will be no personality going blah blah blah for hours, before getting to the point.<br/><br/>Instead, the GM takes 2 out of 3 - and you have a sharp start just with the work done by putting them together. <br/><br/><b>And also, you have a path set for the next step: </b>bring the third into the game with the Characters actions.<br/><br/>i.e. if you start with tragedy and intrusion, as a first step you might want to set the players on the traces of a certain <b>personality </b>(might it be a good potential help, or an evil master that triggered the tragedy)... <br/><br/>if you start with intrusion and personality, the next step is the <b>tragedy </b>that results either by the collaboration of intrusion and personality, or by the conflict of intrusion and personality... or the tragedy to avoid... <br/><br/>if you start with personality and tragedy, you have a classic: your players are after the <b>intrusion </b>(be it the cause of more tragedies, or be it the solution to the tragedy at hand)...<br/><br/>A lot of this is hinted in your work, but I always felt that if you give a clear structure (especially when it comes to games with short instructions and therefore with a lot of blanks to fill), things work out better. It's better to say <i>take 2 out of 3 </i>as a rule, and let smart GMs figure out their own exceptions, instead of leaving it up to the GM to remember to go and pick also another element...<br/><br/>I have a bit of an hangover that makes my ideas look unclear even to myself - if the above makes no sense, just trash it :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432979/#Comment_432979" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-24T11:22:48+00:00" title="May 24, 2014 11:22AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Davide,<br/><br/>Thanks!
