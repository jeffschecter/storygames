Time for part two!  We're writing an adventure for roleplaying.<br/><br/>The adventure is divided into three Episodes, each of which has five Chapters.  I've arranged the elements you provided in a semi-logical way, and now we can build the Chapters out one by one.  Here's how it works:<br/><br/>1.  Chapters must be authored in sequence.  If someone has done chapter One and someone else has done chapter Two, you must do chapter Three.  All three Episodes can be worked on simultaneously, though, so add a chapter to the one you like best.<br/><br/>2.  Number and title your chapter if it needs one.  Include all the elements provided for your chapter.  Add new elements sparingly, but reincorporate when appropriate.  Upon their first appearance, name characters and add color.  Aim for a few hundred words.  <br/><br/>3.  Honor previous chapters and use details provided (names, etc).  As before, play it straight - avoid the weak choice of silly humor.<br/><br/>4.  <i>Only author a single chapter!</i>  I'll change this if we don't get a solid response.  <br/><br/>OK, let's go!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153522/#Comment_153522" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-28T07:03:02+00:00" title="June 28, 2008  7:03AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>EPISODE ONE:  THE MYSTERIOUS RAY<br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE:  THE SNOWS OF KOLYMA</b><br/>A set-piece action scene, in medias res!<br/>Featuring:  A Siberian Gulag, An inventor<br/>Also:  A Stalinist enforcer, swearing vengeance<br/><br/><b>CHAPTER (NUMBER):  (TITLE)</b><br/>Featuring:  A Cagoulard hit-man, the Hyperboloid<br/>Also:  The death of an inventor, Mention of the rogue Japanese scientist known only as \u201cDr. Epoch\u201d<br/><br/><b>CHAPTER (NUMBER):  (TITLE)</b><br/>Featuring:  Head of the local teamsters union (and erstwhile ally), the ancient sword Kusanagi<br/>Also:  A lost crate, A posh gathering of the Mayflower society<br/><br/><b>CHAPTER (NUMBER):  (TITLE)</b><br/>Featuring:  A fistfight and chase on a wooden rollercoaster scaffolding on Coney Island, A Cagoulard hit-man<br/>Also:  A gang of murderers, A timely assist from a radio engineer and future sidekick<br/><br/><b>CHAPTER FIVE:  (TITLE)</b><br/>A climactic battle against overwhelming odds!<br/>Featuring:  Any elements, and definitely the Hyperboloid.<br/>Also:  A prominent clue pointing to Episode Two.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153523/#Comment_153523" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-28T07:03:33+00:00" title="June 28, 2008  7:03AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>EPISODE TWO:  THE PEARL AND THE DINOSAUR<br/><br/>CHAPTER ONE:  THE CROCODILE PENS OF ABDUL ALEEM</b><br/>A set-piece action scene, in medias res!<br/>Featuring:  Puerto Pincesa, Palawan, Philippines.<br/>Also:  Crocodiles -

Junius Bird wiped the sweat off of the stubble on his granite chin and wiped it on his faded fedora, for luck.  He had been captured after tracking the rogue Japanese scientist Dr. Epoch to the fabled crocodile pens of the crazed Arab named Abdul Aleem.  <br/><br/>Dr. Epoch's men had deposited him with a laugh on a little island that was maybe three corpses wide in the middle of the swampy den.  The hungry crocodiles took turns lunging up at their pro-offered meal, and the brave adventurer kept them at bay only with swift kicks from his favorite brown leather riding boots.  He looked over again at the mad scientist who had turned his attention to a complicated-looking device that was set next to an altar built into the rocky prominence.  This was an X-Ray machine that could actually see through the rock to what was beyond!  Other uniformed soldiers stood by with pickaxes and shovels, ready to dig into the perfect spot in the rock.<br/><br/>Above the scientific layout was a network of bamboo and palm fronds to shield this work from prying eyes who might be flying by.  Junius glanced over at his kukri, the heavy curved knife given to him by a grateful Nepalese Colonel.  The pitted and razor-sharp knife was sitting in it's leather sling on a small table next to one of the Japanese guards, who was also looking at the altar.  And then suddenly a roar and a blast of water on Junius' exposed legs as another crocodile lunged at him.  Junius looked down at the crocodiles in the water and at the land about ten yards away, did some quick calculations in his mind, and jumped!<br/><br/>Heads turned in amazement and water splashed as Junius quickly ran towards dry land, using crocodile heads as stepping stones.  He ran straight over and punched the soldier guarding his knife in his face, breaking the soldier's glasses and causing him to drop his rifle.<br/><br/>Dr. Epoch screamed, "Bird!  Get him!!" as Junius grabbed his favorite kukri knife and swiped at one of the bamboo supports.  It sliced right in two, and the entire latticework of bamboo and palm leaves groaned loudly before crashing down on the Japanese.<br/><br/>A few errant rifle shots followed Junius Bird as he ran up a rocky outcropping to safety.  Looking back, he could see that some of the palm leaves had fallen partly in the swampy water.  And crocodiles were starting to make their way onto dry land.  There were more rifle shots and some screams as he ran off to find his seaplane and get some support.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153558/#Comment_153558" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-28T11:01:56+00:00" title="June 28, 2008 11:01AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoa, that's great Chris!
