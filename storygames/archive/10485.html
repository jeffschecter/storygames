I have a pretty solid system and narratology, but can't match it with a sensible, solid genre of cinema that'd provide the contextual support my game needs. Thus, a little game: what movie genre am I describing here?<br/><br/>Early in the movie we are introduced to several strong lead characters - by the half-way point we've seen everybody, most likely. It's not a clean team-up; rather, each character has a distinct set of motivations, and there is uncertainty over allegiances, to be resolved later when the characters either reveal their intents or make choices over the political/emotional/whatever subtext of the story. It is likely that some or all protagonists end up opposing each other. Characters basically gain prominence as protagonists by being bad-ass action stars, and they resolve their differences by fighting each other. The movie draws to a close when only one functional protagonist remains after a series of conflicts that drop others out of the running; alternative endings involve everybody failing. A thematic key point is the concept of allegiance; two protagonists do not need to fight to the end if they are friends, sidekicks or something like that. Presumably the simplest model run for the story involves a quick polarization among the cast over some key point into two camps that fight until only one remains. It's important for the process of polarization to be actual story content, however; there needs to be doubt in the initial stages, the good and bad guys cannot be <i>too</i> clearly delineated from the beginning.<br/><br/>My original inspirations for this game involve the following:\n<ul>\n<li>Hollywood action movies from the '80s, especially the more fantastic and imaginative fare like <i>Highlander</i> or whatnot. The problem with embedding my game into this genre has been the fact that it's not much of a genre, really - there are lots of genres like police action movie, barbarian action movie and so on, but they're not very strong in terms of fictional memes, so none appeal to me very greatly. Also, the fit is somewhat awkward at best, as most of this stuff is way more morally absolute than my narratology above assumes.</li>\n<li>Superhero movies sort of fit into the narrative model, except not quite. They are a genre nowadays, but not a very good one. I'd have to actually like the stuff, and it seems that I like superhero movies in direct proportion to how little they have to do with superhero comics industry.</li>\n<li>Wuxia probably fits this model the best, especially the modern operatic stuff. The most successful playtest to date was wuxia. One might say that I'm interested in finding out whether it's the only genre that fits here without forcing square pegs into round holes. Also, although the game approaches the narratologic a bit differently than <i>Mist-Robed Gate</i>, I'm not that keen to go to that genre if there are alternatives; MRG and Zombie Cinema are already like half-brothers or something in terms of their macro-level structure.</li>\n<li>Probably my strongest inspiration here has been watching too much shonen anime, which basically runs exactly like my narrative framework, above. (Stuff like sports anime, Naruto-style ensemble adventure, so on.) The only weakness is that the game is shaped like a movie, while this stuff is shaped like television series, so good luck with that.</li>\n</ul>\nThe sort of story structure that my model above describes is very basic to movies as well as television, it's just that I'm having trouble nailing the proper art historical narrative context - the genre that provides the best support and inspiration for players when initiating and directing their play. I can name lots of individual movies in all sorts of genres that work essentially like this, but I don't want to make the "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly: the roleplaying game", but rather something with a bit more scope. What is a genre where this story structure is not only possible, but presumed?<br/><br/>So if anybody has any movie suggestions or genres that I should be thinking about but am not, do tell. Even a small hint might get me to think about this in some more fruitful manner.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232972/#Comment_232972" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-18T08:41:00+00:00" title="September 18, 2009  8:41AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2009 8:41AM by noclue.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first thought that came to me was <i>Deathmatch 2000</i><br/><br/>Edit: But it doesn't have the team up part.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232987/#Comment_232987" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-18T09:34:03+00:00" title="September 18, 2009  9:34AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This could easily describe the heist/caper/crime/hustler genre:<br/>Snatch, Reservoir Dogs, Lock Stock &amp;

There's a pretty strong team-up tendency in that set-up, though, when played as a roleplaying game. The original Zombie Cinema actually does pretty well in encouraging internal conflict within the team, which is an important part of the heist movie logic - I even wrote <a href="http://www.arkenstonepublishing.net/zombiecinema/variants#2.2" rel="nofollow">a small variant</a> about it some time back. This new game is supposed to be much more of a blood opera - characters should have strong, contradictory motivations that either pre-exist or come into being through play. I'm not seeing it happening in a heist movie thing without the sort of strong external pressure that the original Zombie rules provide; players would find it more comfortable for their individual characters to cooperate against the external pressure of the police, wouldn't they?<br/><br/>Con movie is an interesting suggestion here. I'm reminded of some particularly offensive examples of the genre. I'm not sure that my game does this very naturally either, but perhaps that means that I'll need to fiddle with the game.

Outside of anime, I don't think there's a codified genre that meets your needs. I think the "showdown story"---ala <i>Highlander</i>, <i>The Quick and the Dead</i>, <i>The Good, the Bad, &amp; the Ugly</i>, etc---is sorta recognized as a "thing", but it's not really a "genre" with established memes and such.<br/><br/>I think you're probably stuck with this choice: You can call it "a game about 'showdown stories'" (or whatever) with a list of example films, and accept that some people will get it and some won't; or you're going to have to take the time to explain the memes and such that the game is built around.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233584/#Comment_233584" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-22T03:04:39+00:00" title="September 22, 2009  3:04AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a succinct conclusion, at least for now.

Let's forget about shounen and heist, and disconsider survival horror (too close to the zombie cinema theme).<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about the <b>expedition </b>theme? Be it by land, seas or space, a group of people forms a team to reach a goal. Sources of internal conflict are differing private motivations, what the ultimate goal is, and how to deal with the stresses created by the travel. And whenever things get dull, you can call the ninjas, in the form of an hostile environment, or even the ninjas themselves!<br/>\n<br/>\nExamples of these are<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aguirre,_the_Wrath_of_God" rel="nofollow">Aguirre, the Wrath of God</a>, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1492:_Conquest_of_Paradise" rel="nofollow">1492: the conquest of Paradise</a>, the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argonauts" rel="nofollow">the Argonauts</a>, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey" rel="nofollow">Odyssey</a>, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_%28film%29" rel="nofollow">2001: A Space Odyssey</a>, Apocalypse Now, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Frequent memes</b>:<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Epic</b>: this is grand scale stuff, no intimist in my room little play.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>longwinded</b>: the issue is never sorted in one day, but drags for weeks, months if not years (although movies, the briefest format of media could be done from them). I don't know if this is a good thing for your game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>macho </b>driven (hierarchy, allegiance to the chief, open power struggles, solve things with fists, or by ripping the problem apart, etc)<br/>\n<br/>\nthere is a well defined <b>hierarchy</b>, often military (commander, perhaps officers, the rest): the Spanish army/navy, Jason or Odysseus, the astronaut whose name I forgot).<br/>\n<br/>\na very heterogeneous group of people, that showcase different approaches, philosophies, or societal aspects: the priest, the henchmen, the aristocrat for the spanish conquistador movies, the different heroes for the argonauts, the various companions of Odysseus, and the astronauts + HAL.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe <b>commander is challenged by an underling </b>(Aguirre, HAL, etc). Sometimes this challenge succeeds, sometimes not. The result is the same, there is a new commander.<br/>\n<br/>\naside from the commander issue , there is general <b>internal strife</b>.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe enterprise is <b>dangerous</b>, and it may fail completely, so that everyone loses (and dies).<br/>\n<br/>\nregardless of general success or failure, <b>a lot of the expedition members die</b> (I'm not so sure how the Argonauts fare in respect to this trope)<br/>\n<br/>\nthe travel is more important than the goal, and the internal conflicts are often more important than the travel. It's basically a <b>traveling hui-clos</b> (this is less true for the Greek variants).<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>exotism</b>: they always go see exciting and strange places<br/>\n<br/>\nfascinating and <b>powerful women </b>(choke full in the Greek and Spanish variants)<br/>\n<br/>\nawesome <b>monsters</b>! (the jungle, the savages, HAL, monolith, cyclops, the sea, the storm, space, charyb and sylla, captain Kilgore, etc): the frightening unknown, non-living, living, sentient.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Mc Guffin</b>: the aim is often just there to kick start the story, and is not story worthy (find some fleece, go back home, inspect a radio emission, discover a new trade route, find a city of gold).<br/>\n<br/>\ndrifting and <b>loss of purpose</b>: often the original aim is lost, and the heroes' sense of purpose starts to weaken (Odysseus forgets about returning home, the Spanish expeditions doubt about the validity of the reasons for them to be there, not to speak not knowing where they are, in 2001 the astronaut goes well beyond his target, in Apocalypse Now the director does not know how to finish the movie, etc)<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>laughing in the face of death</b>: faced with ultimate danger or death, someone still has the strength of be defiant and laugh at the gods (Aguirre, for instance)<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>madness</b>: in all these stories people end up quite mad, insane or bizarre. This often gets ugly and you get episodes of sadism, sociopathy, murder or torture (Kurt, Aguirre, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess you can probably dig others...<br/>\n<br/>\nNB: formatting the bbcode is really a PITA at story-games                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kickback" title="kickback"><img alt="kickback" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kickback">kickback</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233745/#Comment_233745" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-22T16:40:35+00:00" title="September 22, 2009  4:40PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 22, 2009 4:42PM by kickback.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">I can name lots of individual movies in all sorts of genres that work essentially like this, but I don't want to make the "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly: the roleplaying game", but rather something with a bit more scope.

It seems to be pretty fun when we get it to work, which seems to depend on how carefully we prepare the scenario before letting the characters loose on each other.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235780/#Comment_235780" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-05T14:45:20+00:00" title="October  5, 2009  2:45PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My first thoughts were to racing games (<i>Cannonball Run</i>, those ones from the '60's that look like David Niven should be in them), "eyes on the prize" type movies (<i>Mean Guns</i>, <i>Congo</i>, the first half of the <i>Mummy</i>) and "I don't need to outrun the bear..." style horror movies where the cast is slowly picked off by Evil, but also conspires against each other (<i>Screamers</i>, <i>Cube</i>). <i>Running Man</i> may be a bit closer to what you are after, where there are actually multiple goals at work, some of which certain characters are not even aware of most of the way through (e.g. Arnold's character doesn't know what the "resistance" is until halfway through, and doesn't care at first when he finds out.)<br><br>It seems like a lot of these, however, share a notion of an external force that isn't one of the characters. You can imagine a <i>Cannonball Run</i> game, for example, where some of the players are cops, but that isn't in the movies; cops are a faceless adversary there. In <i>Cube</i>, the party with the strongest motivation in the story is whoever created the cube, but who they are and what they want, when it is explored at all, is more part of the set than a character. <i>Mean Guns</i> may be the exception, where the guy who actually sets up the whole situation is a known character.<br><br>Maybe these are all just a specific subtype of McGuffin-based plotting, where what matters about the McGuffin is that everyone wants it, perhaps for different reasons. This is sort of "Yellow Clearance Black Box Blues" style gaming. <br><br>I guess my point is sort of that in most of these stories, there is the notion of some active force that creates the situation, while most of the characters are reacting to it (and typically forced into alliance and betrayal because of that). It seems like that "active force" needs to be either a GM or a really mature player.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235918/#Comment_235918" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-06T10:56:24+00:00" title="October  6, 2009 10:56AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, Lester... you see, <a href="http://www.arkenstonepublishing.net/zombiecinema/" rel="nofollow">Zombie Cinema</a> is already that game.
