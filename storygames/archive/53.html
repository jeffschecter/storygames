                    I purchased GoO's <i>A Game of Thrones</i> RPG and saw the following RPG Manifesto on page 2. Apparently, GoO puts this in all their new products. I think most of it is bunk. Andy saw <a href="">my LiveJournal rant about it</a> and encouraged me to post here in a thread aimed at producing a better Manifesto. 
<blockquote><br/><b>GoO's RPG Manifesto</b><br/>These rules are written on paper, not etched in stone tablets. <br/>Rules are suggested guidelines, not required edicts. <br/>If the rules don't say you can't do something, you can. <br/>There are no official answers, only official opinions. <br/>When dice conflict with the story, the story always wins. <br/>Min/Maxing and munchkinism aren't problems with the game; they're problems with the player.<br/>The Game Master has full discretionary power over the game.<br/>The Game Master always works with, not against, the players.<br/>A game that is not fun is no longer a game -- it's a chore. <br/>This book contains the answers to all things. <br/>When the above does not apply, make it up. <br/></blockquote>
We can do better, right?                </div>

                            Always stick to the rules. They work better than you think.<br/>
Say yes or roll the dice.<br/>
Rules are official and not optional.<br/>
Rules always support the creation of story.<br/>
Min/Maxing is not a problem at all.<br/>
Power is distributed along particular lines among all players.<br/>
Players play together, but may work against each other, and the rules actually make that fun.<br/>
<br/>
There. That seems to be Dogs' manifesto, for example. I like that one much better.                        </div>

                            Yeah, I think it'd have to be book-specific.  Some projects (Emily Care's Romance Trio) might have shared "manifestos" but, to me, the very suggestion that every game that I ever design will fall under one manifesto seems to be missing the point, terribly limiting, and makes me wonder why anybody would want my second game.                        </div>

                            Well done. Yes, the "Golden Rule" which GOO seems to be spewing, is one which we've already rejected as part of the general idea that games don't have to be made to work. <br/>
<br/>
I use a particular analogy with which I'll make my own version:<br/>
<br/>
 - Ford's Promise - <br/>
Our cars are made of parts, not carved in stone. <br/>
The way we've built the car is a guideline, and we can't keep you from altering it.<br/>
If the car doesn't stop you from doing something with it, we allow you to do it with it (within the limits of your local law).<br/>
There is no blueprint for the car, just a vague idea for how it was put together.<br/>
When the car goes right, and you want to go left, you were right to want to go left. <br/>
If the car doesn't drive fast enough, it's the driver's fault, he should take a train. <br/>
The owner of the car can do anything he wants with it. <br/>
The owner of the car must work with the mechanics he comes across, not against them.<br/>
If the car breaks down, do not try to drive it. <br/>
The car can do anything you require of it. <br/>
When it does not, change the car until it does. <br/>
<br/>
Oooh, yeeah. Give me that car now! Largely it comes down to:<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, we know it's broken, but here's the thing...we give you our permission to fix it as neccessary to work how you want it to work!<br/>
<br/>
And people wonder why so many RPG gamers design their own games. Sheesh. Hopefully this exposing of the negatives of the position will help forming an idea of what is right to do. <br/>

More seriously, I admit that Xenopulse's list would give me a rash, but perhaps I've been burned by things that have sucked by the book.  As such, I might seriously add to such a list:<br/>
<br/>
* If the game is not to your taste, play a different game rather than fixing this one.<br/>

I would still fervently disagree, but I'd at least feel the point had been touched upon.<br/>

PS - Which is worse, ackowledging that your game may not be able to handle every situation well, or asserting your game _can_ handle every situation well?  Slightly flip question, but I suspect the divide on the answer may be illuminating.                        </div>

                            Heh. Amusingly, I bought Dogs twice, and twice gave it to people I thought would enjoy it, thinking I'd get a chance to pick it up again, so it eluded me for some time.  Got another copy for Christmas with firm orders not to give it away, so hopefully I will finally get to actually play it soon.  <br/>

Damn good read though, and on paper, I'll buy your manifesto as suiting it, and I'm looking forward to seeing how play makes or breaks it.<br/>

<i><br/>Which is worse, ackowledging that your game may not be able to handle every situation well, or asserting your game _can_ handle every situation well? Slightly flip question, but I suspect the divide on the answer may be illuminating.<br/></i><br/><br/>I think it's always worth being clear what your game does well, and I don't think it hurts to admit areas where it doesn't do well. In fact, Dogs suggests if you want a large group, play another game for example "...the game works well with as few as two, and I wouldn't go over say four, plus you the GM. There are other games that really rock with a big group, so if you've got a big group, try one of them." Two paragraphs later, it talks about the group buying into the genre, and if they don't, try another game.<br/><br/>The key is that you always want to talk in positive terms. Vincent's text in Dogs is a good example. It affirms that you may have a larger group. It affirms that it plays best with 2-4 players. It doesn't dis anyone.<br/><br/>Hmm, how does setting fit in here?<br/><br/>Games with very specific setting are providing rules that we fully expect to change if we don't like the setting. I'd say the game's manifesto (shared with the reader, or just posted on the author's monitor) still shouldn't talk about changing setting. A designers notes section, or a section on "creating your own setting" would be a more positive way to suggest you might want  to change the rules. If the game is something people would highly likely abandon the provided setting, it probably pays to make it clear which rules that might appear to be setting rules are actually core rules. For example, Dogs would be weakened if you took fighting and guns out of the setting, but Dogs is also pretty clear about why fighting and guns are there and how they play into player decision making. On the other hand, it's clear that Dogs could be played in a non-western setting so long as it has guardians of the faith, sin/temptation, and guns.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>
