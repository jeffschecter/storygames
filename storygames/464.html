Genre is tricky.  Cartoon superspy rebels in a 1920s steampunk world, I guess.  There's so much incredibly cool stuff to talk about, but it's all so very tightly bundled together.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, you're a rebel, existing outside normal society, fighting to defeat the Masterminds that hold the giant city of Tiran in their thrall; rebels are kids, geezers and Cogs (clockwork people).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe neatest thing is...<br/>\n<br/>\n...Scratch that.  Some of the neat things are:<br/>\n<br/>\n-The Cogs.  Because robots are cool, clockwork robots are even cooler, and the art for these specific clockwork robots is utterly perfect.<br/>\n<br/>\n-The core systematic, which is basically paper-rock-scissors with extra symbols (for a total of five), in which the symbol you win with describes the stat you used, gives a look at the way the maneuver is described, and dictates the special effects of it's own victory.  So if I won with "rock", that would mean I won by being patient, would describe accordingly, and specific things would happen as a result.  It's a conflict system, with different types of conflicts.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Characters are dead simple - one type, five stats, a couple of traits.  Go.  Play.<br/>\n<br/>\n-The whole setting that the writers are putting together from the original concepts is just *neat*.  They seem to be bent on stuffing as much cool stuff in the bag as possible; crazy organizations, hints about weird "urban rebel legends", physical set-pieces that scream things like "stick a robot in the back of the wind-up plane, and an old man in the tail-gunner position!  There's EVIL to fight!"<br/>\n<br/>\nUh...   Basically, I'm frothing now.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Ahem*.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_8907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/8907/#Comment_8907" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2006-04-04T02:23:01+00:00" title="April  4, 2006  2:23AM">April 2006</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude, frothing is cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's the prohibitively expensive part of it?<br/>\n<br/>\nyrs--<br/>\n--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_8908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/8908/#Comment_8908" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2006-04-04T02:30:21+00:00" title="April  4, 2006  2:30AM">April 2006</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I couldn't make it work on my own.

Read review.  Interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me go into this a little deeper; then you can tell me if you still think that.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou decide whether to make a move that is Cunning, Daring, Graceful, Patient, or Zealous - and so does your opponent, revelaing simultaneously.  Each kind of move blocks two others, is blocked by two others, and overlaps with itself (both happen).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor myself, I think it maps onto what the character is thinking really well; if you want to hit hard, choose daring.  If you want to outwit your foe, choose cunning.  And so on.  But if you're always the same thing, you get predictable, and opponents will take advantage of that - if they *know* you'll probably choose to be patient, they'll maneuver accordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe description of it is yours - you tell me what's "patient" for your character, or "daring".  So you customize accordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not everyone, of course, so I'm sure I'll shut out someone with this decision.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_8927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/8927/#Comment_8927" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2006-04-04T07:43:50+00:00" title="April  4, 2006  7:43AM">April 2006</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What is this "money" of which you speak?

About money; I won't say everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, what I have is a really simple package.  Each of the writers got to pick a "cents per word", and a "percent of gross profit".  The higher the cents, the lower the percent, and vice versa.  They picked their numbers.  Now, the specific numbers, I'm not going to go over - I think that they have a right to at least that much privacy.  I will say that the cents per word average out just a little below the bigger RPG company standards, but the percentage ranges are higher.<br/>\n<br/>\nI contracted informally with people I knew could do the job I needed, and do it the way I needed it done - no open calls; I read buckets of RPG stuff and ideas, and I knew what I wanted.  "Professional" and "experienced" weren't on my list of qualifications, but as it turns out, most of them do have some margin of experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey got payment for their first 5000 words up-front, and I'll be 'topping it up' as we go along, until we hit a full book.  The whole book is already "budgeted" by page - and every page is set to format, and is basically one point on topic.  So, unless things come up where pages need reorganizing, they can write directly to format; about 500 words to a page.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the writers has been helping out with system as we go along, so it's not all me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for my own experience, uh - well, I've been making my own little games since forever.  And I know what I want.  Beyond that, I'm not as organised as I'd like, but I'm slowly inching towards it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_8979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/8979/#Comment_8979" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2006-04-04T13:57:40+00:00" title="April  4, 2006  1:57PM">April 2006</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for that.

After that, just a few sentences a page get heavy edits, thus far; we'll se if that changes, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n-So far, flavor only.  That'll change as we go on.  Consistency is ensured by a few means; the individual assignments are small, each is pretty clearly laid-out, and the writers do some talking to each other.
