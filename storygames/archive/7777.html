Ron Edwards said demeaning things about stakes about a year or two ago, and made it clear that you could be way cool without them.<br/><br/>So, are stakes a thing of the past? What's good about them? If you're a designer creating an RPG, why might you choose to use set stakes in conflict resolution?<br/><br/>I can start:<br/><br/>Stakes can be really good for getting people's thought process out in the open. For a group struggling with conflict resolution, trying to identify which rolls are meaningful and which are not, or looking to make sure conflicts and rolls have meaningful consequences, this sort of open communication is really useful. Perhaps any game looking to use rolls or conflicts in specific ways or specific situations should recommend for the players to set explicit stakes, so they can all police each other and help each other identify those situations.<br/><br/>(Ah, but would the have More Fun if they dropped explicit stakes eventually?)<br/><br/>Clarity, on its own, is also a bonus. Knowing what to expect before you go into a conflict might create a greater sense of security in the players, which might be good for games looking to make the players feel safer or more comfortable.<br/><br/>Finally, stakes go well with garlic, or stuffed in vampires.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172437/#Comment_172437" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T15:11:51+00:00" title="October  1, 2008  3:11PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have no problem with Stakes so long as they are defined as "in fiction, in character goals and intentions."

In BW, while you discuss Intent, any given Intent has to be resolveable with a specific character ability. So, like, "blowing up the world" isn't really a suitable intent because there's no "blow up the world" ability. But there are also reeeeealy loosey-goosey versions out there that don't have such a restriction. Just off the top of my head, you can pretty much toss any old conflict out there in Shock: and it comes down to a roll-off. In my own AP, it seemed like a non-issue. We were all aboard what would or would not be a suitable scope for the conflict.<br/><br/>On the second part, that can seriously suck. I've got players in my groups who toss out a big stake (say, a broad outcome for the Duel of Wits -- a notable exception to the "every intent must be resolved with a skill" ethos in BW), wait for the other side to come back, get freaked out by the equally-big counterstake, then whittle down each side 'til you're left with an uninteresting competition. All the wheedling bleeds the tension out of the conflict and you're left with meh. I don't yet have a mechanical solution for that -- it seems to come down to trust between players.<br/><br/>Funny that stakes are now a "debacle." Are they really?<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172450/#Comment_172450" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T15:33:21+00:00" title="October  1, 2008  3:33PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 1, 2008 3:35PM by Jesse.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Ranter?

In some stakes setting games I've seen, you completely skip the "how" you are trying to get what you want. Which to me is what makes what happens believable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hate, if I win, X happens, if I lose, Y happens, roll, ok, this happens without describing in any believable way how or why. And there is no tension.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like defining what it is at stake by choosing a tactic. A tactic being an ability, skill, or whatever. If I choose investigation, then information is at stake. If I choose knife fighting, then your life is at stake. Then you describe how which determines the scope of what is at stake. If I choose to cut you in self defense to keep you back vs. plunging my knife into your eye or investigating who killed the victim vs. who was the last person in the room. Then we roll and any number of things can happen. I could get my stakes at the scope I described. Or not. Or we compromise. Or we escalate. Or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn games where we don't describe how but then narrate the results of something where we already know what happened seems strange in that it doesn't matter and isn't very exciting (to me at least).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172473/#Comment_172473" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T16:56:55+00:00" title="October  1, 2008  4:56PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool points, everyone.

It's not the only way to to that.  IAWA declares itself "not stakey", as it's all about "actions" but it's also all about "interesting actions".  There's no roll to open stuck door, whiff, roll again.  So really I think that is more a general design issue "does play revolve around resovling interesting stuff" than a unique "stakes attribute".<br/><br/>I agree that just rolling to see "do I win the lottery" is boring and also "implausible thus annoying" - it must be something the PC could achieve, and the mechanics should be about how you get there and involve creating the fiction of what happens along the way.  And it's fun if those mechanics can end up taking you somewhere other than simply resolving the declared stakes as declared, show you something about the PC's, encourage character expression/development/change etc..<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172505/#Comment_172505" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T20:53:45+00:00" title="October  1, 2008  8:53PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Different games, different kinds of stakes, I reckon.<br/><br/>Two come right to mind:<br/><br/>Burning Wheel:  "What is your intent?"

If one player was throwing that out, but the other players clearly wanted to get more detailed, re-negotiating the stakes or even denying a call for using a resolution mechanic is probably in order then and there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172554/#Comment_172554" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T06:56:10+00:00" title="October  2, 2008  6:56AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I'm sure I'm the wrong Paul but I'm gonna reply anyway) <br/><br/>Graham: On that note, I was (eventually) pleased with how Shock: generated outcomes. It took me a little while to get my head wrapped around the two-unrelated-intents model, and it's <i>very</i> story-oriented (rather than character-ability-oriented), but the fact that a) it generates four possible outcomes and b) there are ways to chase narrative control independent of chasing conflict victory seems to get at what you're saying.<br/><br/>Some of my BW players have found the "this is what your failure will be" model jarring. Making it more fun for the players has meant openly addressing that issue with them. Like...for one of them, it turns out he's really into the challenge of overcoming whatever it is that pops into the GM's head when he fails. That voyage into unknown territory is part of his fundamental RPing excitement. Stopping and talking about the conflict is very much an anti-"immersive" moment. For another of my players, what makes it jarring is the urge to jump into negotiating the stakes downward into "safe" outcomes, even though he rationally sees that it produces boring conflicts.<br/><br/>So, for the first guy, basically it comes down to the GM (me) staying vague about the details of failure but still indicating the general tone of where I see it going: "If you fail this stealth roll, the guards will surely take notice." Even that sometimes proves to be too much information, too authorial for the moment. <br/><br/>I'm still working on a better approach with this one. In movies, you often get some kind of foreshadowing scene that highlights what's at risk, right? Like, a quick flash of approaching guards and flashlights, or security cameras sweeping a room, or whatever. That's the cue to the audience: "Oh shit, he's gonna get caught! Watch out! ...Whew, he made it." That sort of thing might be worth exploring, although some conflicts (the big emotional showdown in particular) are very opaque in other media -- it's not clear what either side will win or lose 'til all the revelations have been made. All you have to go on is the buildup of prior scenes, accumulated grievances or trust or issues between key characters.<br/><br/>For the second guy, the one who's resorting to social engineering prior to committing to a roll, that strikes me as more a matter of trust (fear that I'll deliver an unfun consequence). Unfortunately, it seems that BW's solution for dealing with low-trust players is -- ta da! -- to prenegotiate stakes. That's a tougher one, and I haven't had any luck getting the system to work to solve the trust problem.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172609/#Comment_172609" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T09:34:42+00:00" title="October  2, 2008  9:34AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Filip, if you narrow down the stakes that much with PTA, what does the high card for narration even mean at that point?<br/><br/>I used to very much play PTA that way until I was gently corrected about how the rules worked and have found that I enjoy it much more with a general intent and the holder of the high card narrating the outcome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172612/#Comment_172612" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T09:43:22+00:00" title="October  2, 2008  9:43AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sadbunnydrama</cite>Whoever wins the narration doesn't have all that much to say in terms of what happens at this point, but it's up to him to wrap this stuff in his chosen aesthetics, adding some details of symbolic importance, references and stuff.</blockquote>\nThis.<br/><br/>I often find myself investing resources into the conflict just to win the right to control this input.<br/><br/>Now, we used to play with general intents, but that way the resolution generally felt bland, and at times, it was frustrating.<br/><br/>What do you mean by bland?

Where's the fun in that!?!"<br/><br/>I asked how many times one uses the Resolution system because, well, I can see the annoyance if you're only using the thing once or twice in an entire session, but I don't really see what the big deal is with the lumping and pre-negotiating if there will be further game developments after the roll.<br/><br/>Edited to add:<br/>I think I may be missing something as well, though.

Because, I'm not seeing it.<br/><br/>In John's example, has he already given that the character will inherently convince the king? That the only thing in question is whether the character is banished or not, even despite the fact that he's gotten the king's help?<br/><br/>I admit, I do jump ahead a bit, but my understanding of that example would be:<br/><br/>Outcome one:<br/>The king helps the pc. Or, perhaps more accurately, becomes willing to help the pc.<br/><br/>Outcome two:<br/>The pc gets banished and presumably the king is unconvinced to help the pc at all. <br/><br/>I mean, I suppose he could simultaneously banish the pc and be conviced to help the pc, although that would seem to me a tiny bit odd ( not impossible I suppose-perhaps there's some convoluted charade going on).<br/><br/>As for "What's the outcome of the conflict ?", well, I thought that was, roughly _the_ point of ConRes: Done is done. The chips have fallen where they've fallen, so let's go forward with events. Imean, doesn't stating the risk of a course of action generally imply what comes next?

Intense interest in any case.<br/><br/>I can't speak for anyone else, but one of the reasons I like the Pre-Negotiated stakes is that a central goal for me is to have people interested and happy no matter which way the die-throw goes.<br/><br/>Note, this has zero to do with characters being happy.<br/><br/>I would call pre-negotiated stakes a sort of reverse CYOA Book approach. Remember those? You'd read a section, then choose between 2-3 outcomes, based on a little info from what you'd just read and the way the choice was described.<br/><br/>Now, in that case, you didn'y know what you were getting, with the case that many times you came to an abrupt end (often either Boring-Happy or Unhappy-Suck), and ended up flipping back in your choices anyway. <br/><br/>Pre-Negotiated stakes sorta reverses that by putting out agreeable outcomes ( again, agreeable <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to the players</span>), then randomly deciding between each. <br/><br/>The players then riff off where a given outcome has taken them to continue the game.<br/><br/>Personally, I don't see the charm of games that produce results no one wanted. It seems to fly in the face of human-centered game design. I mean, I've got computer games and other pre-programmed game types for that kind of thing, and a ton of forms of passive entertainment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173675/#Comment_173675" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T19:59:48+00:00" title="October  6, 2008  7:59PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 6, 2008 10:00PM by Moreno R..">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't really beat this quote from Vincent Baker about this (Eh, it shows that he is more used to this strange "english" language than me...)<br/><br/><a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=360" rel="nofollow">http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=360</a><br/>-------------begin quote----------------------<br/>"Here's what I'd say: if all your formal rules do is structure your group's ongoing agreement about what happens in the game, they are a) interchangeable with any other rpg rules out there, and b) probably a waste of your attention. Live negotiation and honest collaboration are almost certainly better."<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, the purpose of an rpg's rules is to create the unwelcome and the unwanted in the game's fiction. The reason to play by rules is because you want the unwelcome and the unwanted - you want things that no vigorous creative agreement would ever create. And it's not that you want one person's wanted, welcome vision to win out over another's - that's weak sauce. (*) No, what you want are outcomes that upset every single person at the table. You want things that if you hadn't agreed to abide by the rules' results, you would reject.<br/><br/>If you don't want that - and I believe you when you say you don't! (**) - then live negotiation and honest collaboration are a) just as good as, and b) a lot more flexible and robust than, whatever formal rules you'd use otherwise.<br/><br/>The challenge facing rpg designers is to create outcomes that every single person at the table would reject, yet are compelling enough that nobody actually does so. (***) If your game isn't doing that, like I say it's interchangeable with the most rudimentary functional game design, and probably not as fun as good freeform."<br/>-------------end quote----------------------<br/><br/>How this apply to this in my opinion?  In the fact that, by carefully negotiating stakes that don't bother the players in conflict, and negating any meaningful imput from the high card narrator (that could be another player) you produce a "safe" story that go where you negotiated it going (the conflicts in these kind of stakes setting is usually - and in the example in the other thread about this they are - about details in a pre-set conclusion). Then you play a scene that you already know how will end.<br/><br/>I am not going to engage in a battle of tastes. Everyone has his own. But I would find this boring. (and I did: we made this error playing PTA the first time, and when we understood how the game was to be played by the rules, the game improved immensely)<br/><br/>[edited to show more clearly what I did quote from Vincent and what I wrote myself]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173680/#Comment_173680" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T20:32:49+00:00" title="October  6, 2008  8:32PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 6, 2008 8:41PM by komradebob.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You just <span style="text-decoration: underline;">did</span> engage in a battle of tastes, Moreno.<br/><br/>Out of curiosity, do folks who are against "negotiated outcomes" style resolution think that this is an invitation to give everyone (fictional) puppies and ice-cream or something?<br/><br/>I mean, my experience is that people negotiate out a couple of things they like and are interested in, and that set up further action in the game. People seem as likely to toss outcomes out that make things more complicated for the characters, not less. But they're complications the actual players at the table are interested in, and have had a direct hand in creating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

blog, so the blame (or credit) lies with him.  I'm with Vincent on this one, but as I think he's pretty careful to point out, he's expressing what his own taste is in game rules, and speculating that if you're just going to negotiate until everyone's happy with the result, why not chuch the rules and freeform?  <br/><br/>So I guess that's the question (although not the question for this thread maybe): What do you get out of conflict resolution which simply chooses between multiple desirable outcomes? Surely one of those outcomes is more desirable than the others? If so, why not just choose that option, and hang the rules?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173686/#Comment_173686" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T22:10:09+00:00" title="October  6, 2008 10:10PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 6, 2008 10:14PM by Moreno R..">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Robert!<br/><br/>This is a quote from a post from sadbunnydrama in the other thread (keep in mind that he play with his own hack of PTA, not the actual rules - but you do the same, I would say):\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sadbunnydrama</cite><br/>In my notes from the last show, I have this scene (it was the final scene of the previous to last episode; which effectively resolved the character's Issue as well, something about the price of truth, I think): "Sojuro, wounded, meets with Yoko in a restaurant. He takes the truth out of her. He kills her. Then, he slaughters her men and walks away." In play, it went kind of like that:<br/><br/>We moved to the resolution pretty quickly, after the exchange of just a few sentences between Sojuro and Yoko. It was obvious that the further conversation would only artificially drag things out, and Sojuro's player wanted a roll.<br/><br/>"So, I will kill her and I want to roll."<br/>"Do we roll to check whether you kill her, or do we assume it as a given?"<br/>"Hmm, I want it to be a given."<br/>(Some players consider whether they would need Yoko alive in the final episode, but they accept her death right now, right there.)<br/>"So what's the big question mark hanging over here? Do we want to make it uncertain whether she confesses the truth, or maybe whether her bodyguards kill you? It seems like this scene should resolve your Issue for good."<br/>"Actually, I want her confession, I won't be comfortable with a development which doesn't involve her confirming everything to my character."<br/>"Maybe let's check whether she tells him the truth before he attacks her, or dying at his hands?"<br/>"Hmm, let's say she confesses first. Then I'll cut her head off with a clean slash."<br/>"So, we roll to see the consequences for Sojuro?"<br/>"Yup, maybe if I win, I calmly walk away, with the bodyguards standing there in shock. And if I lose, a fight ensues and I'm killed in the end."<br/>"Hmm, wait, we might still need Sojuro in the final episode, as he's connected with this and that. Even if you die, you can still appear in some flashbacks, but these are very present matters. Though on the other hand, we might be able to deal with all that stuff without Sojuro's active participation..."<br/>"And what if the fight ensues, but the scene ends ambiguously, with your character standing there overwhelmed, or thrown to the river from a speeding car, or something?"<br/>"Yeah, that's good, let's go with a climactic fight with the bodyguards, with Sojuro overwhelmed if I lose, and cut at that."<br/>"So, Yoko will make a confession and you will cut her head off, and the roll determines whether you walk away or wind up overwhelmed by her bodyguards?"<br/>"Yup, I'm perfectly fine with that."<br/><br/>Then we rolled (we played via Skype, with Gametable, so using the 1st ed dice method instead of cards was easier for us), and the narration's winner summed up the development of events, adding some John Woo flair to the scene. I think we already knew the truth as players at that point, so the confession wasn't role-played in detail.</blockquote>\nThis is IMHO a perfect example of what I was talking before: group-mediated "story before"<br/><br/>Keep in mind, again, that nobody here is saying "you shall not play story-before!". Millions of people play story-before and are perfectly happy.  At least 100 persons play happily "story before" for any one player who play "story now". This is not a value judgment. It's simply that _I_ (myself, talking only for me) prefer story-now.<br/><br/>[edit: it could be argued, with some reason, that this IS story now when the "now" is the bargaining for the stake setting, not the playing of the conflict scene. So I have to clarify: I prefer story-now _happening during the roleplaying part_]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173694/#Comment_173694" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T23:40:54+00:00" title="October  6, 2008 11:40PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, this is getting pretty dizzying with two conversations at once. I'm not sure where to put this post. I've chosen the second thread as it's more debate-oriented in purpose.<br/><br/>So I'm in the camp of rolling to resolve the character's immediate intent, and here's why: it's the most sensible grounding for resolution without haring off into abstract realms of future developments or acausal events, and without violating the players authority over their characters thoughts, emotions, etc. In Filip and Kamil's example:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sadbunnydrama</cite>In my notes from the last show, I have this scene (it was the final scene of the previous to last episode; which effectively resolved the character's Issue as well, something about the price of truth, I think): "Sojuro, wounded, meets with Yoko in a restaurant. He takes the truth out of her. He kills her. Then, he slaughters her men and walks away." In play, it went kind of like that:<br/>[EXAMPLE FOLLOWS]</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: drunkencatgirl</cite>Being the producer in this scene, most of details and fiction have been worked out as it was our fourth session. We knew the truth behind the conspiracy, the relation between Yoko and Sojuro and what Sojuro's player was aiming for his character. It was more about conclusion and final statement about Sojuro's issue. Somehow finishing character's issue outside player's decision felt wrong in this case. Anyway, we were really angaged in this scene - sorting out what can happen, what is interesting and what does this all mean to the Sojuro.</blockquote>\nSee, you guys were rightly committed to saving Sojuro's actual working out of his Issue for player agency and not a toss of the dice. That's the old "Roll to resolve your grief" cliche, right? You didn't want that, so you kept it out of the roll. You retained control as players over "what it all means" to Sojuro.  But there's also the matter of Sojuro's intent--what's he trying to <i>do</i> in this scene? PTA gives you the right to let any number of physical (or social, or whatever) accomplishments succeed automatically if that's not the <i>real</i> point of the PC's actions. But still. To my eye it looks like you ignored all kinds of interesting possibilities for Sojuro and Yoko's relationship, making the most hair-raising and critical elements in the scene all givens. "Roll to see if you kill a dozen ninjas" would probably be a lousy PTA stake, but "roll to see if you kill an immensely important NPC"? That's a stake I can get behind. The unwillingness of the player to put that question (or any other question of his relationship with Yoko) up for grabs leaves me rather cold.<br/><br/><i>Now</i>. Of course you came up with stakes you were happy with and had fun. Of course your preferences are not my preferences. And I wasn't there; I don't know the larger context or the dramatic character of the moment or the emotions of the players or anything. Maybe it just <i>did</i> feel right that THIS is the moment where Yoko has to die. I'm just trying to explain from the information I've got where my preferences seem to differ and why.<br/><br/>And in the end, THIS:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sadbunnydrama</cite>"So, Yoko will make a confession and you will cut her head off, and the roll determines whether you walk away or wind up overwhelmed by her bodyguards?"</blockquote>\n. . .is exactly the jarring, deflating thing I experienced when I played PTA the way you describe: you hammer out all these details, then roll, then the narration-winner is faced with the task of <i>repeating</i> a bunch of stuff everyone's already said, but <i>cooler!</i> When this happened to me, we generally ended scenes with awkward stares and mumblings, like: "uh, I guess all that happens." "Hmm, do we wanna talk out some of the dialogue?" "nah, we already pretty much know how it goes." bleagh.<br/><br/>And on a related note:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>And I am completely opposite of Jesse on this; I think stakes should absolutely be used to decide between the preferred outcomes of the players, and whatever the fictional characters "want" is decidedly secondary.<br/><br/>Plus, it gets around forcing inanimate objects to have intent, which I personally think is fucking stupid.</blockquote>\nSee, Robert, this attitude is bizarre to me; making what characters want (or more to the point, what they <i>do</i> to get it) "secondary" seems to miss the point of creating fiction at all. YES it's really players making the decisions (I am the biggest "My Guy" hater on the motherfuckin' planet). YES it's the enjoyment of real people that are the point of the activity. But we're pursuing that enjoyment by <i>moving fictional constructs around</i> in our heads. When those fictional constructs are, say, rocks, then they can be just rocks (fictional rocks). But when the constructs are <i>characters</i> (that is, imaginary people), then they you bet your sweet ass they have intent (fictional intent). Without putting intent at the fore of the shared imagined space we're creating, we're not making a story with any kind of human grounding. <br/><br/>Doesn't mean we have to get lost in emo realms of <i>feeeeelings</i> and "what do I <i>really</i> want" and "what does it all mean?" In fact that's <i>exactly</i> where intent-based resolution cuts through the bullshit and says "A'right, a'right. Forget how you feel and the awful awful angst and the pain inside that no one understands. . .what is your <i>intent</i>, with this action, <i>right the fuck now?</i>"<br/><br/>All of which brings me to this quote of John's:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>My only issue with stakes is pre-playing what will happen disconnected from what you are doing.</blockquote>\nA-fucking-men. this is it, right here.

Of course the simplified and polarized version (Ronny says Stakes are baaaaad!) is what propagates across the internets.

In such cases you declare their "intent."<br/><br/>My argument for this though, is that this is exactly the "narrative logic" that you see in stories.  My favorite example is the malfunctioning elevator.  If the players try to open the maintanance hatch a beam gives way and jams it shut, if they try to pry open the doors it falls half a floor making the holes too narrow, if they try to use the emergency phone the power goes out.  Whatever the characters try, the elevator "fights back" in the EXACT appropriate way, as if it somehow knew what the characters were doing.  <br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173752/#Comment_173752" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T06:20:45+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  6:20AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh!

That's not why I'm there. I really find it pretty restrictive.<br/><br/>____<br/><br/><br/>Other thoughts:<br/><br/>Mass happiness:<br/>This thread was strated with the question of why someone might use stakes at all in a design. It has drifted to a quesion of why someone might use a particular sort of stakes in a design.<br/><br/>I think Moreno answers it best. First, lots of people appear to really like it. I don't know the ratio of peopel, though Moreno posits 100 people like it for every one who prefers vague-stakes. Right there we start to see that this technique feels right to lots of folks and seems to give them "fun" results.<br/><br/>More interesting,(to me) is the question of whether it is Play-now!!!!, which Moreno posits is a possibility. I'd certainly say so. I suspect other folks who play this way would also be shocked to find out they're not actually playing but pre-playing ( PTA being an exception specifically because of the High Card issue. Of course, that could simply be dropped entirely, or shifted to a role like that which Filip has described and which seems to work successsfully for his group).<br/><br/>The Lost Possibilities!!!<br/>I don't give a shit about the possibilities that no one cares enough to pursue.<br/><br/>I hope that clarifies my stand on that.<br/><br/>I've asked for actual plays where the no explored possibilities were vastly cooler than the one that got played, which is, of course an absurd request; Since they were never played, we have no idea whether they were cool or not. What we do know is how things went with a series of events that people actually did negotiate down on, and pull fiction-stuff into. <br/><br/>Again, repeatedly good results on a regular basis.<br/><br/>So why use this at all, instead of Vincent's Open negotiation?<br/><br/>It ain't an Either/Or situation.<br/><br/>You know, just like every other rpg. People can and do negotiate during play.<br/><br/><br/>But, as to a roll-off (or other resolution mechanic)The reason is simple: Two people can have really great ideas that are just different. They take the story in different directions, and any further "forks in the the story" are going to continually change that path. Freedom to not immediately negotiate means the ability to explain your idea and put it out to the group without immediate modification by other players. It also means that, through negotiation, you can end up with very different directions, all of which the players find intyeresting and valid. It also allows all players to participate in that, not just a single player selected by structure or card draw or die throw.<br/><br/>(Further, Vincent, I'm sure, is quite aware that there is more to game structure than just a resolution mechanic. Even if there wass simple honest negotiation as the resolution mechanic, there are still plenty of other things a rules-set can provide.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173939/#Comment_173939" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T15:20:28+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  3:20PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sadbunnydrama</cite><br/>As a side note, I find Vincent's use of the term "freeform" somewhat confusing.

I'd love for you to talk about how negotiation did or rather, didn't work in your freefrom experiences. Perhaps in another thread?<br/><br/>As far as the rest of it goes, No, Vincent's word is not law and his tatses not universal, and I'm entirely happy to conced that the difference between "pre-negotiation, detailed stakes, narrator mostly colour" PTA and "character-intent stakes only, negotiate after cards, high card holder has broad power" PTA is a matter of taste.<br/><br/>I'm mostly just trying to explain why I think the latter version of PTA is better, but I cannot in any sense <i>prove objectively</i> why it is; I can merely explain the thought process that led me to that opinion, and the assumptions underlying that process.<br/><br/>And they key assumption for me here is that <i>I want the game to produce results that nobody knew that they wanted.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174002/#Comment_174002" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T20:52:49+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  8:52PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's good to work all of this out in a thread, like this.

I'm in the "I want to be surprised" camp, but here's a thing nobody has pointed out before, that is a big reason why I'm not personally into prenegotiation:<br/><br/>When we prenegotiate stakes, that everyone is comfortable with, we discuss and we hash out two interesting paths the story can take. I'm a person that easily invests in ideas (which might be why I like being surprised by what the narrator says, as I can quickly go "Alright, what's awesome about this?"). And I invest in both of these outcomes. I start thinking about how they can be cool, and then one of them ends up not happening.

But I would submit that intents (we can leave emotions aside, I think) are the <i>primary</i> factor that a woeld of humans, real or fictional, is based on. The "bigger sweep of things" you mention is just the intersection and interactions of <i>myriad intents</i> across human society.<br/><br/>Of course in an RPG you're not going to try to model all the thousands upon thousands of intents that directly impact your characters' lives. You're going t be selective, focusing mainly on the intents of protagonists and antagonists, and even then on the more dramatic or significant ones. When you need to plot a course for how "the world" at large acts toward your characters, you're going to eyeball it to create a rough gestalt out of your head, not model each and every citizen of your city or whatever.<br/><br/>Which all looks very obvious, I know. But I think it drives home the point that <i>very little</i> in the lives of your characters is not driven by<i>someone's</i> intent. Sure, there's rain and earthquakes and floods and such, but mainly it's people doin' shit to other people.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>I come from a fairly traditional GM background, where I play with "the world".

So you're into the control of a broad range of fictional elements, including multiple characters. Cool. I personally think this falls perfectly into the model I constructed above; no matter how many NPCs you're guiding and fiddling with, they still all have intents.<br/><br/>I don't think there's anything the intent-centric people have been describing that requires "control of a single character." That's a whole 'nother axis to consider. We're just talking about, whatever number of characters you're directing the actions of, focusing on resolving their intents moment to moment. Works fine for "playing the world." That's exactly how I GM now, in fact; I've found that I flounder horribly with multiple characters under my control if I don't have a concrete understanding of what each character wants and what they're willing to do to get it.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sadbunnydrama</cite>As a side note, I find Vincent's use of the term "freeform" somewhat confusing. The games generally described as "freeform" that I participated in didn't involve any functional negotiation at all in the first place. No structures that would create a negotiation-friendly environment were in place, mostly due to a general social contract mess. Our PTA hack, for example,</blockquote>\nI think that's the source of your confusion, right there: It's not PTA or any of the published games that tend to get called "rules-lite." I believe Vincent's talking about <i>honest-to-God</i> Freeform, as in you toss out the rulebook (in his case Ars Magica) and develop your own semi-articulated resolution processes. In other words, it's all negotiation, all the time. That, I understand, was one of Vincent's key formative roleplaying experiences, and I daresay it colors his approach to rules a <i>ton.</i> Like, there's a little voice in the back of his head when he considers designing or playing ANY RULE, that asks, "would this give me something that freeforming with Emily and Meg wouldn't?" and if the answer is "no" then that rule is OUT.<br/><br/>Vincent can speak for himself, of course. ut that's roughly my understanding.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174046/#Comment_174046" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T06:50:04+00:00" title="October  8, 2008  6:50AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Um, Filip, did you read my post, that's right above yours?
