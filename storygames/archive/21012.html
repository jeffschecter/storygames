What do people think about this mechanic? Fun? Annoying? Both?</blockquote>\n<i>Follow</i>, by our resident Ben Robbins, is the most exciting implementation of this I've played, and it's <i>really</i> tense. Part of it might be that we're used to dice and cards as randomizers, while a bag of stones still carries some novelty factor - but we usually held our breath when drawing and we (foolishly) cursed the stones for their unfairness.<br/><br/>Usage of the bag and stones in Shreyas Sampat's <i>Mist-Robed Gate</i> is similar to <i>Follow</i>, but not quite as exciting - I think by design, as it's employed in choreographic duels which are, basically, a vent for excess tension in that game. It's the deterministic, not random ritual of the Knife that escalates tension.<br/><br/>The above games are similar in that players make moves (in the broadest sense) to put stones into the bag and then draw one (two, in <i>Follow</i>) to find out the outcome of their actions so far. A more sophisticated, quite complex take on the same is found in Paul Czege's <i>The Clay That Woke</i>, where about a dozen different kinds of tokens exist (some common, some unique) representing both aspects of the character and their situation, and a sequence of 1-4 draws is to be "read" as a unit of meaning to discern an outcome, complication or development. It thus moves a step further away from randomizing a binary outcome (pass/fail) and toward the traditional arts of divination. Unfortunately, I've yet to play that game. <br/><br/><i>Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple</i> (Daniel Solis) - which I quite enjoy, though it's been a while since I've last played it - is sort of the reverse of the above designs, IIRC, in that play starts with all the stones in the bag. Drawing a combination of stones is the first act in a player's turn, yielding constraints on what they can narrate on said turn, and the summed up pool of all stones drawn by a player is relevant to the endgame.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461174/#Comment_461174" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-18T13:13:32+00:00" title="March 18, 2017  1:13PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, this is all about watching the options go <i>into</i> the bag.
