                    So, after having realized that my spy game project was too big to get to any kind of actually final state without fooling around with, I pulled together a riffable manuscript, and wrangled Josh and Mark into play testing with me.  And, all in all, I'm ridiculously excited that I did.<br/><br/>I haven't done much but kvetch about how everyone seems to have my ideas, so let me lay out what we were playing with.  The game is essentially a competitive story game, strongly influenced by Greg Rucka, but also by all the "realistic" spy genre stuff I've been able to absorb.  Honestly, I'm a long way from done on the research for this beast, but the game of it is gelling - slowly.  `<br/><br/>Essentially, each player controls an agency (which the proviso that while I say "agency," you're encouraged to select a revolutionary group, an international crime ring or, most challenging of all, al Queda.)  In actuality, you probably only sketch out an important core or the real, larger group.  To wit: 3 principal agents, and enough of their auxiliaries for everyone else to play.  Names, roles within their agency, and an optional specialty are all you really need each.  Which is good because you wind up creating, as Josh is fond of pointing out, "like, 10 guys!"<br/><br/>Play proceeds through a series of planning turns.  The active player picks a principal, frames a scene, and the other players take on auxiliary roles.  In character narration develops a situation, while a silent negotiation (facilitated by a bunch of little colored chips and boards) establishes what's a stake and how hard it'll be to accomplish.<br/><br/>Planning turns go in rounds, each player picking a principal each time, and the stakes accumulating between rounds.  Once every principal in an agency has come into play, a player can start the actual operation, which is resolved by more open, director-stance narration and card play.  A yoink from <cite>Sorcerer</cite> plays into the card resolution, and players win or lose influence (in the form the chips.)<br/><br/>And on the whole, I think it worked great.  Josh played al Queda, Mark ran the Russian FSB and I grabbed the German BND.  Having deciding on the public image and core values of our agencies (by way of what I think could be a really neat little centering mechanic) and come up with at least names for everybody (which was especially fun, granted that we're not always great at inventing names for single characters), we got started.  Now, this is intended as a long form game, so we cut short a little bit, and only played out all of Josh's planning scenes.  Al Queda wound up with a daring duel pronged scheme that involved decimating the ranks of the FSB by simultaneously inciting Chechen's to assassinate the detachment there, and killing an official in Berlin.  In the meantime, the BND planned to recover embarrassing Russian documents from refugees in Chechnya, and the FSB was attempting to expose the fact that German intelligence knew about 9/11 ahead of time.  In the end, a Turkmen in the employ of the BND recovered some incriminating records, all the al Queda members were arrested or run over, and the Russian leak was quashed by the Berlin police.<br/><br/>Typically, as it stands, it's a little byzantine.  Well, a lot byzantine.  Even I was having trouble remembering what all the squares on the negotiation boards meant, when it was time to pay out.  Simple fix: reduce their numbers by more than a half, and fold their various meanings in on themselves.  Mark caught a problem with being able to load boards at the last minute, but there's a simple fix for that.  The thorniest problem is that what was supposed to be a neat, straightforward resolution system wound up consuming the entire deck of cards.  Well...<br/><br/>Here's the biggest flaw, and I think we dodged a bullet at the last minute.  After all the setup of planning, operations as written come off serially.  And as my intrepid play testers recognized, I really do want to see different agencies acting simultaneously, either in parallel or in conflict.  On reflection, I also want to see how an operation in the offing influences plans in the making.  But as written, neither would happen.  I'd resolve my mission, and then you do yours, and that's exactly what I don't want.<br/><br/>So we wound up playing out resolution as I'd planned, except with all three of us at the same time which consumed the entire deck (and we basically lucked out not needing more cards.)  Resulted in a really cool three way narrative, but all the same we could have done with fewer cards.<br/><br/>So, I'm already settled on reducing the negotiation sheets to 6 boxes from 14, and I'm still fooling with ways to simplify the card play, and ways to draw agents into risk more simply and more reliably.  Oh, and possibly a mechanical way to involve the goals and presentations of the agencies.  Hopefully I'll have a more solidified version in a week or two.<br/><br/>Oh, one last thing: Mark made the excellent observation that the feel is something like the film <cite>Syriana</cite> is nature, and we agreed (more important: I feel) that the name ought to be like a cousin to that.  Coversia, maybe.  Something like that.<br/><br/>(edited to fix boneheaded principle/principal blunder)                </div>

                            It seems that you got more Syriana than Rucka. Do you want to focus on inter agency play or on the group dynamic within the agency? If you want to hgo back to the latter you could have each of the former agency posistions be departments within the agency. One group could be the survelance guys from MI5 another could be the Minders a third could be the liason from MI6 with their own internessine rivalries. I have been trying for a similar state for a long time and have not hit hte nail on the head yet. best of luck and as soon as you are willing to share rules I will see aboiut a blind playtest.                        </div>

                            That sounds like a fun and very different game! How do you think it would work with more than 3 players? And is there any actual interraction/roleplaying between the playerS?<br/><br/>As for the name, why not go for the Syriana feel and name it after some sort of made up foreign country like Bolgravia or Irania or Indistan ... Which prompts my last question - is it intended to be played out between global groups on an international scale, or could you set it within a single city or country with cells/agencies competing for control of the local area? That'd be cool.                        </div>

                            I'm really excited to see this game get elaborated and polished.  The game we played last week was pretty cool, but you could also see underneath the skin the potential for full-blown awesome that the finished game can provide.<br/><br/>Judson, I think your next bugaboo is going to be time.  I understand it's a long-form game, but I'm thinking that you should be able to do a negotiation phase and an operation phase in a single session -- which will be a challenge cramming all that complexity into that time.                        </div>

                            Thor and Andrew,<br/><br/>First of all, thanks very much for your enthusiasm!  I'm glad someone else out there in TV land has similar buttons to be pushed.<br/><br/>It would certainly be <em>possible</em> to set up a game of this where you were playing agencies of the same government, or departments of the same agency.  I think the rules as they stand (and will eventually become) will support that just as well as CIA vs. al Queda vs. Russian Mob.  And honestly, as much as my original inspiration was Rucka, I'm liking the <cite>Syriana</cite> vibe that's resulting from where I'm going with it.  Inherent in the design is the idea that the players are competing, and that you throw stones in the way of your opponents through the mouths of their associates.  If you're playing Rucka's SIS with this system, and you start a planning scene with Crocker, then I introduce challenges to your agency through Lex or C, if you see what I'm saying.  <br/><br/>On reflection and discussion, what I'm really having trouble with (and I'm not sure this isn't half due to player expectation) is having the planning scenes be meaty in and of themselves.  Essentially, they should serve as conflict introduction and elaboration scenes, with the mission scenes being the resolution payoff.  There's a lot of focus on playing those scenes in character, by way of giving everyone one character to play, and removing all need to discuss the mechanics of what's going on: it all happens with chips.  (In fact the rule is: you don't talk about the mechanics.  You talk about the fictional situation, and move chips to indicate what you mechanically mean.)  <br/><br/>One possibility is contracting the relationship map: every principal needs to be directly related to other principals, (at present, they can be indirectly related, which makes more sense from an espionage standpoint than from a storytelling one) so that if you start a scene with Crocker, I can play Tara Chace, even though I'd be playing her as an auxiliary character.  Which of course begs the question of what the difference is.  I'm yet to be convinced that a hard line needs to be drawn, but I'm tempted by the idea that the principal in a scene is responsible for interpreting the information presented by the auxiliaries, and that those roles are both right and responsibilities.                        </div>

                            This was fun to try out. It was geopolitical &amp; some characterization/roleplaying &amp; some strategy &amp; tying together multiple plot threads- none of which you knew how they would turn out. <br/> <br/>I think Josh &amp; I came to the table with expectations from a host of board games &amp; rpgs that there is set up and that the pay-off comes later in resolution/action. <br/><br/>Since the planning and interweaving of plot upon plot (the set up) - are the main point here, you need a way of signalling and teaching that in advance so players don;t have that 'wait for the resolution' bias swirling around in their heads.                        </div>

Agreed.  Josh recommended that more character conflict would help with that, and I'm teasing that idea around to see if it's got legs.  I'm remembering that I'd originally conceived that you'd shuffle around the tiers of your agency, but I think that'd be confusing and disassociative.  Another thought that I'd had was some sort of explicit "at the end of each planning scene, you need a key idea that you write down" or something.<br/><br/>The pot's brewing on this one.  Expect to hear more about it soon.                        </div>
