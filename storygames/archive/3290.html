Over the next four weeks I have access to a letterpress.  It's a Chandler &amp; Price press from the 1890s and looks similar to the one <a href="http://www.postdiluvian.org/~mason/letterpress/cp-letterpress-8x12-old.jpg" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  There's also a Vandercook press from the 1960s, but it doesn't have as much soul as the C&amp;P.  I also have a major art project due in the letterpress class at the end of the four weeks. <br/><br/>So here's what I want to do. I want to print a game using the letterpress and bind it as my project. <br/><br/>There's a few things to know about this project:<br/><br/>1. The game has to be short.  I'm going to be laying out type and creating photopolymer plates for this, plus buying, cutting, dying, and binding all the paper, so I'm shooting for a game that's about six to eight pages long.  Something along the lines of Phil Reed's <a href="http://www.roninarts.com/store/product_info.php?cPath=5&amp;products_id=490" rel="nofollow">vs. Outlaws</a> or my <a href="http://gameworld.thesnakefarm.com/owlpooh_revised.pdf" rel="nofollow">Winnie-the-Owl-Pooh: Adventures in d100 Acre Wood</a>.<br/><br/>2. It's extremely short run.  I'm going to print about two or three dozen copies of the final book.  About ten copies go to the class.  I'll keep four copies for my portfolio.  I'll send the rest to you.  You can sell them as special art books alongside your real print run or whatever.  I'll also send you photos of the chases and the work in progress if you'd like that sort of thing.<br/><br/>3. It's an art project, not a bookbinding project.  I'll be designing (or redesigning) your game to make it work with the project.  That means the final game book may be printed in a way to make the game unreadable.  For instance, if this was the <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> RPG I was printing, I'd do some treatments to the pages to make them darker and harder to read as you delved further into the book.  The CoC book would also contain pages with <a href="http://www.waterslettering.com/AlphRelief.jpg" rel="nofollow">blind embossing</a> that has type printed over it.  Depending on the type of game you have, the treatment of the book may be totally wacked out or totally straightforward.  Pages might be missing, too, but I'd like to keep as much of the game in there. <br/><br/>4. Small studio equals small type collection.  We don't have a huge variety of type available.  The typeface we have might not contain enough of the letters needed for the job, so your copy may change.  For instance, we have 30 point Brody, but when trying to lay out "Kara loves Elmo!", I discovered that the studio has no lowercase v's in 30pt Brody.  As far as handwritten playful scripts go, we also had 36pt Brush Stroke, but we don't have 24pt or 30pt.  If I wanted to publish a version of <i>vs. Outlaws</i>, I couldn't follow the terms in the vsM Engine trademark license because we don't have 10pt Times Roman Bold Italic, which is required to write a credit line on the front cover.<br/><br/>5. I can only use black and white art.  No gradations, no fades, no 30% fills.  If you have artwork that has to go with your game, I'll have to manipulate it in Photoshop or else it should be ready for a one-color press.  To the <i>vs. Outlaws</i> example, <a href="http://www.93gamesstudio.com/images/vsmlogo.gif" rel="nofollow">the vsM Engine logo</a> has a 30% grey fill making the logo impossible to print.<br/><br/>6. It's not you, it's me.  The thing that got me going on this project was the <i>vs. Outlaws</i> game and Keith Senkowski's <i>untitled</i>.  I can see a whole bunch of cool stuff to do with each of those.  If I get jazzed on your game, I'll contact you and see about collaborating with you on that.  If your game doesn't get my creative juices flowing or the subject matter of the game doesn't really lend itself to the tools we have in the studio, I'll pass.  <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">If I wind up not doing anything suggested in this thread, it's not intended to be a slight.</span> <i>Editied: Okay, there's some cool stuff here.  I will be doing one of the games that was posted about or PMed to me, but I'll still make my decision on Monday.</i><br/><br/><br/>So that's that.  If you would like have me turn your game into a small, extremely short run printed book that may be totally arted up and unuseful as a game text, go ahead and post a description of your game here and I'll make a decision on which, if any, I'd like to spend the next four weeks of my life working on.  There's some links at the end of this post about letterpress works to give you an idea what can be done in the studio.<br/><br/>And if you don't want me to do up your game, you can still look at the links.<br/><br/><br/><a href="http://members.tripod.com/~Trudge/images.html" rel="nofollow">Galler of Bruce Licher's work</a><br/><br/><a href="http://images.google.com/images?um=1&amp;tab=wi&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=Ndi&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=letterpress%20works" rel="nofollow">General letterpress work images at images.google.com.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74664/#Comment_74664" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-09T09:51:00+00:00" title="June  9, 2007  9:51AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, I <i>so</i> want to see how this project turns out.
