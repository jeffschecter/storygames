Or maybe you want to wander into the Wyld and create an isolationist new Creation, free from the sins of the First Age? Or maybe you want to be an Exalted Robin Hood and steal from the Dynasts and satrapies, spreading their wealth to the poor and beleaguered? Or maybe you just want to storm Heaven and wrest control of Creation from the gods blinded by the Games of Divinity?

Here goes --<br/><br/><b>EXALTED via Smallville/Cortex:<br/></b><br/><b>die caps (both for rolling and stress):</b> d4 mortal, d6 heroic, d8 first circle, d10 second circle, d12 third circle<br/><br/><b>mortal =</b> mortal humans.<br/><b>heroic =</b> enlightened mortals and bestial dragon kings.<br/><b>1st circle =</b> terrestrial spirits, dragon-blooded exalts, demons/spells/artifacts of the first circle, and enlightened dragon kings.<br/><b>2nd circle =</b> celestial spirits, lunar and sidereal exalts, and demons/spells/artifacts of the second circle<br/><b>3rd circle =</b> solar exalts, demons/spells/artifacts of the third circle, and the primordials and their curse<br/><br/><b>note:</b> these die caps (both for rolling and stress) can be broken via numbers: get enough mortals (or first circle demons or celestials or whatever) together under a single general and even mortals can reach a d12 die effectiveness, which becomes a d12 trait for the general and also increases the general's stress cap to d12. see mob/army size examples below.<br/><br/><b>virtues: start each at d4 and do 6 step-ups (note the die caps).<br/></b><i>example:</i><br/>valor d12<br/>temperance d4<br/>conviction d6<br/>compassion d6<br/><br/><b>traits &amp; motivations: start at 0 and do 25 step-ups (note the die caps).<br/></b><i>example:</i><br/>excellency: swordsman d12<br/>charm: blinding smile d6 (persuasion)<br/>artifact: starmetal daiklave d10<br/>small army: the band of starving tigers d8<br/>pet: demon monkey d4<br/>motivation: my sword belongs to the night witch ylana d8<br/>motivation: i will kill the sentinel d6<br/>motivation: i will marry the scarlet empress and unite the realm d10<br/><br/><b>every solar gets the same 3 distinctions. distinctions are not rolled, but they do change the rules:<br/></b><b>- caste: exalted of the sun:</b> for every die that rolls 7+ (beyond human potential), the sun and the moon and the stars momentarily smile down upon you and you gain a point of essence.<br/><b>- virtue flaw:</b> choose 1 related to your highest or lowest virtue.<br/><b>- cursed: anathema:</b> take an essence point and add to the trouble pool whenever you follow your virtue flaw (or whenever you accept a virtue fail [related to your virtue flaw or not] bribe from the gm).<br/><br/><b>some definitions:<br/></b><br/><b>traits =</b> skills, charms, spells, anima effects, artifacts, armies, contacts, organizational statuses, properties, lands, etc. if a trait is confusingly worded, like charms often are, put the typical imposed condition in parens.<br/><br/><b>excellencies =</b> a type of trait. spend a step-up to make any trait an excellency: you can now spend an essence point to reroll a die when using this trait.<br/><br/><b>charms =</b> a type of trait. allow supernatural effects beyond heroics.<br/><br/><b>artifacts =</b> a type of trait. an item of power. note that the die cap applies to both the nature of the item and to the user. if the artifact's circle is above the user's die cap, then use the lower of the 2 die caps (i.e., a dragon-blooded warrior could attune to and use an orichalcum/third circle daiklave, but not necessarily at its full potency -- if the daiklave is normally a d10 or d12, then the dragon-blood could only use it at a d8).<br/><br/><b>mob/army size examples for trait ratings:<br/></b>d4: 1 mortal<br/>d6: 10 mortals<br/>d8: 100 mortals or 1 1st circle<br/>d10: 1000 mortals or 10 1st circles or 1 2nd circle<br/>d12: 10,000 mortals or 100 1st circles or 10 2nd circles or 1 3rd circle<br/>-note: mob/army trait die size could go up or down multiple ranks, depending on morale/supplies/magic/etc.<br/>-mass combat trick: separate the army into multiple, separate trait units called on by separately-rolling commanders, to better use the resources at the army's disposal.<br/><br/><b>some rules:<br/></b><br/><b>normal conflicts: roll 1 virtue + 1 trait + 1 motivation.</b> add the two highest to obtain your result. if another character or group is aiding you, they roll separately, up to 3 dice as normal (virtue + trait + motivation), and add their highest die to your total.<br/><br/><b>stress:</b> "damage" results in an imposed condition:<br/>-an imposed condition against a player can be his virtue flaw, toward limit break at "stressed out" (or toward stress relief scenes where he deals with his flaw before a full limit break, either through indulgence or through meditation, etc.).<br/>-an imposed condition can also be just about anything else, such as: injury, unaware, uncertain, shaken, confused, terrified, calm, in love, loyal, berserk, etc.<br/>-an imposed condition can be rolled as an extra die by players (against gm characters) or gm (against player characters).<br/>-a player can spend essence to roll his own condition as an extra die.<br/><br/><b>roll d6 to determine your starting essence</b> for the session.<br/><br/><b>every point of essence spent in a scene:<br/></b><b>-increases the size of your anima banner,</b> from nothing to 1) the glint of a third eye, 2) caste mark blazes, 3) anima glows, 4) iconic anima totem reveals itself, 5) anima banner at full display, burning high into the sky and visible for tens of miles around.<br/><b>-increases the trouble pool</b> (wyld hunt, spirit activity, primordial curse, etc). starts at 2d6 and steps up from there (dice cap does apply to whatever is being introduced to the fiction via the trouble dice).<br/><br/><b>essence can be spent by players to:<br/></b><b>-combo 1:</b> roll 1 extra virtue/trait/motivation per point of essence.<br/><b>-combo 2:</b> after your roll, add a third (or fourth, fifth, etc, per point of essence spent) already-rolled die to your total result (normally just the sum of two dice).<br/><b>-excellency:</b> if you have any excellencies and they got rolled into a conflict, you can spend an essence point to reroll an unsatisfactory excellency die.<br/><b>-add a motivation:</b> d6 for the scene, d4 perm after that.<br/><b>-call on destiny:</b> a d6 tool or person or location can be brought into the scene and (potentially) used for the scene.<br/><b>-make your pain into a weapon:</b> roll your imposed condition as an extra die.<br/><b>-yield:</b> the sun, moon, and stars look away you as you yield an in-progress conflict.<br/><br/><b>complications occur when anyone rolls a 1:<br/></b><b>-any 1s rolled by the gm</b> are used by players to add a narrative detail/complication to the gm's intent and to take 1 trouble die away for every 1 rolled.<br/><b>-any 1s rolled by a player</b> are used by the gm to add a narrative detail/complication to the player/s' intent (but no die or essence effect, just narrative).<br/><br/><b>challenging a motivation:</b> x3 dice for that roll, then step-down for remainder of session, then change the statement and step back up or don't change the statement and stay stepped down. add the original die size to the growth pool for that session regardless.<br/><br/><b>xp/growth:<br/></b>-virtues as a group cannot increase beyond d4 base + 6 step-ups; they can, however, be rearranged.<br/>-traits and motivations can, however, increase beyond the starting allotment of 25 step-ups.<br/>-characters can gain/lose traits through play without a growth roll, whether by gaining an army (example: by routing and dominating an opposing force), losing an army (examples: defeat or mutiny) or gaining/losing an artifact or dominating a spirit into sharing a secret charm or persuading a spirit of the appropriate virtue to grant you inner peace or hate or whatever, etc.<br/><br/><b>doing the impossible:<br/></b>if a pc wishes to break game setting rules (such as, but not limited to: resurrecting the dead to real life, inventing a charm or spell for teleportation, tampering with or destroying or removing or stealing an exaltation, dying but dragging your exalted soul down to the underworld with you instead of letting it incarnate to its next exalted host, cleansing an exalted soul of the primordials' curse, freeing the primordials from malfeas, etc.), simply add a d20 to the result of the opposition's roll. (yes, this means the players are going to break the setting. good for them!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411135/#Comment_411135" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-02T16:29:13+00:00" title="April  2, 2013  4:29PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">@stupidgremlin</a> and <a href="/forums/profile/joelshempert">@joelshempert</a> are big fans of Smallville around these parts.
