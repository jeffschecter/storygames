This is especially true for classical roleplaying games like Warhammer, Drakar &amp; Demoner, Fabula and GURPS.<br/><br/>However: there may be inherent dangers in trusting too much in the die, especially for the would-be designers of the games of tomorrow. As the die has been used a lot, it may be that old ways of using it will produce "old" gameplay, and nothing fresh. It may be that the use of dice is a bad design-choice in new games altogether.<br/><br/>Still: the die is a very effective and applicable tool, that makes random results with little colour and great rapidity (a die is neutral in itself, and easy to read). There may still be ways of die-rolling that has not been explored yet, totally fresh ways of using the die. There may be ways of designing the die itself that will make it a new tool.<br/><br/>This thread is for thinking aloud on what dice may be/do in future games, and for examples of how dice have been used in more modern games. Post any thoughts you have on it!

I only just read <i>1001 Nights</i> for the first time last week and I was briefly confused when it said something to the effect of "You need lots of dice of lots of different colors and sizes" at the very beginning.  I thought to myself, "But WHICH sizes?  ALL of them?"  Later it became clear.  The are called, in the game, gems, and they sort of represent that as well.  Thus colorful dice of a variety of sizes are nice.  They are sometimes used as randomizers, but either it only matters whether they roll even or odd, or the current GM determines what numbers mean what.  It's pretty spiffy and carries no risk of scaring off new players with lots of talk of d12s and d20s and d4s and what-have-you.<br/><br/>I haven't played it (or read the book) but doesn't <i>Bacchanal</i> do some funky things with dice?  Aren't they supposed to all be placed in a wine glass or something and when they are "rolled" you do so by knocking over the glass?<br/>Anyway, I think it is definitely possible to utilize dice in interesting ways that add to the theme and feel of a game...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153794/#Comment_153794" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-30T07:33:23+00:00" title="June 30, 2008  7:33AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2008 7:34AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dice in <i>1001 Nights</i> are gems; there's a strong presentational aspect to their use in the game.

Come on Callan; be nice and say YES to the premise!<br/><br/>I have full plastic bags of dice, but only two good games where I use them. And both of those games use a single T20, nothing more. So what am I to do with the rest; the shiny and oddly shaped gems in my bags? I'm not designing new games with dice anymore.

So I'm thinking that some novel way of doing it may turn the track. I would very much like to try Megueys game; <i>1001 Nights</i>. To have dice as aesthetic elements in the game, gems, makes me think it would be real nice to play. And so many have talked about it!

Awesome.  That's *exactly* it--more and more successes is actually boring and uninteresting, while a string of failures is outright frustrating.  As I've said before, game designers are good at thinking about expected value or the mean amount of, for example, damage that a spell will do\u2014they're bad at thinking about standard deviation / variance.<br/><br/>I just bought the "Event Cards" for Settlers of Catan\u2014haven't had a chance to use them yet.  Though there's a little more to it than this, the idea is that there are 37 cards, with the normal 2d6 distribution on them plus a "reshuffle" card that gets placed seventh from the bottom.  I've only played one game using them, but it really alleviates a lot of the frustrations people often have with Settlers\u2014I'm looking forward to using them more.<br/><br/>And in d20 I do think replacing the d20 with 3d6 is a good idea though I haven't tried it myself.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
