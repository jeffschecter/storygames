Am i missing some clever trade-off or limiting mechanism that makes numbers bigger than that a real problem? The reason actually has much less to do with "more powerful" mechs, and mostly to do with the fact that i keep coming up with cool mechs that have more than 4 attachments. On a related note, there's no reason you <b>have</b> to count something, just because you can, right? Again, nothing's gonna break if i make a 4-legged mech and don't give it a green die, is it? [With no other rules changes, of course, and no cheating--i'm not gonna wait 'til my 4th attachment is blown off, and then start counting the extra legs as an attachment.]<br/><br/>Second, what would be the impact of letting mechs have more than one ranged weapon at a given range? Specifically, with the following rules mod: multiple weapons at the same range don't stack dice. [Or, actually, now that i re-read, maybe just go with the existing rule of "no more than 2 red dice".] IOW, you'd be wasting an attachment slot so that, when you blew one gun off, you'd still have another at that same range. Does this make sense? What would the consequences be? [Conceptually, i like the idea of a mech that's got, say, 3 or 4 direct-fire attachments. Even if it would suck, rules-wise, because i'd start out with 2 red dice at direct-fire, and pretty much nothing else. But i'd also stay that way through a lot of damage. Or a mech with giant claws, lashing tentacles, a scorpion stinger, and a chainsaw.]<br/><br/>Third, it looks to me like the victory point system will mostly iron itself out regardless of setup--especially if we care more about the playing than the winning. One of the problems we had last time was that, with 6-7 people playing, (1) you end up with small, "boring" armies and (2) it pretty much is a pointless free-for-all. Or at least it was for us, partly because of no backstory, but partly because everyone was roughly equal. So, i've proposed that for this game we have a definite set-up, and structure "bases" (i.e., objectives) a bit differently:<br/><br/>One defender, with a large army--probably 8-10+ mechs--and a defendable base or two.<br/>Six "unaligned" armies, all small, but of varying sizes--from 2 to maybe 4 mechs each. So, the combined unaligned armies will probably be about double the defender's army. My first thought is no bases for these armies.<br/>Two or more "uncontrolled" objectives, one behind the defender's lines, the rest elsewhere. I.e., they don't count towards anyone's initial points. <br/><br/>Calculate all starting points, and points per, as normal. The backstory is that the unaligned armies have teamed up to capture the objectives from the superior defender's forces, but the defender got there ahead of them and is already closing on one. The unaligned armies aren't required to remain allies. Let the blood and destruction begin!<br/><br/>Now, does this sound like a reasonable set-up? Is there something in the rules that'll make a heavily-lopsided battle Not Fun? Do we need to implement something more rigorous than table-talk for regulating shifting alliances? (I know we *could*, but does it look like we *need* to?)<br/><br/>Any other random thoughts [related to this topic]? [Oh, and i've looked at Vincent's Mechaton campaign suggestions. I don't think we want quite that much structure to deal with, but maybe? I know we're not gonna play an actual campaign--we're having too much fun, and attendance fluctuates too much, for that to improve our game. We want individual battles.]                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67565/#Comment_67565" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-08T09:53:46+00:00" title="May  8, 2007  9:53AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are a lot of good questions.  I've only played Mechaton for about 30 minutes, so I'm not a good one to ask.  But here's my thought:<br/><br/>(a) Nothing breaks immediately if you have 5 or more attachments.<br/>(b) It's perfectly fine to leave something "off."  That's what the white dice utility dice are for.<br/>(c) Having tons of the same attachment should work--even if they stack--though it's going to be a crummy mech<br/>(d) 6-7 people is a lot of people!  Maybe too many.  Also, Mechaton is totally about winning points (through carnage).<br/>(e) Having one guy with 4 times the number of mechs as the opposition sounds really lame to me b/c it means he'll be gathering 4x the amount of time and have 4x the complications to keep track of.

That's why i'm wondering if there's something special about 4, or if 5 would work just as well, provided everyone used the same limit. Not gonna change it for this weekend, anyway--too many people have already built their mechs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/woodelf" title="woodelf"><img alt="woodelf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/woodelf">woodelf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67655/#Comment_67655" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-08T16:13:50+00:00" title="May  8, 2007  4:13PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite>(c) Having tons of the same attachment should work--even if they stack--though it's going to be a crummy mech<br/>(d) 6-7 people is a lot of people!

OK, whatever the setup, everyone has at least one base of some sort to defend/control. But anybody see a problem with starting the game with some objectives/bases that no one controls? Will that screw up the point totals for victory points?<br/><br/>Hadn't thought about the spotlight-time issue. That could be a real problem. <br/><br/>OK, how does this set-up strike people, given the larger number of players: \n<ul><li>all roughly-equal armies all with at least one base, <br/></li><li>initial set-up (that is, physical placement on the table), and/or back-story starts them out allied into, say, 3 factions<br/></li><li>some uncontrolled objectives at the game start<br/></li></ul>\nWhat i'm trying to do is provide some initial guidance so that it isn't just "everybody attacks everybody within reach" free-for-all. Yeah, blowing each other up is most of the fun, but it's nice to know that there's a *little* more to it than that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

That doesn't mean everyone had the max number of mechs or attachments--it actually varied quite widely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Just 'cause more mechs could have defensive attachments without giving up weapons, spotting, and movement (which all seem offensive-favoring, to me)?<br/><br/>And, yeah, i'm definitely thinking about teams of some sort.
