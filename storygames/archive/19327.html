It's a diceless, gm-less and no-prep RPG for exactly three participants. This game has three rotating roles; one for the person establishing the scenes, one for the person playing the antagonist and the other as the protagonist. Each player gets a chance to play each role thrice. Each protagonist has four drives that motivate them, and one must be sacrificed each scene.  As a result of these series of hard choices, you will be left with the single drive that matters most to your character.<br/><br/>Many other games have contributed to this design. <b>Fiasco </b>contributed to the length of each scene and the general flow of play. <b>Microscope </b>inspired the timeline and how history builds upon itself. <b>Shock: Social Science Fiction</b> helped me focus on how technological changes lead to societal transformation. <b>Durance </b>inspired the hard choices, where you force the voyager to make a difficult sacrifice.<br/><br/>If you are curious, I would love your thoughts. The full game is available for free download if you pledge a dollar.<br/><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/Jagash/posthuman-pathways" rel="nofollow">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/Jagash/posthuman-pathways</a><br/><br/>Cheers!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
