                    So, <a href="http://www.contestedground.co.uk/coldprev.html" rel="nofollow">Cold City</a> will be available on the Forge/IPR booth at Gen Con. One thing that has struck me about designing CC is that it represents a big leap forward in the way I look at the mechanics of a game. Yeah, I realise this is something others cottoned on to a while back, but it took me a bit of time to get it. However, I'm delighted with the results. It's a game that I feel combines the atmosphere I wanted to create, the themes I wanted to include with a system that actually promotes all of this.<br/><br/>A pleasing result.<br/><br/>So, if you'd like to sample a game of hidden agendas, trust and monster hunting set in Berlin in 1950, then swing by the Forge/IPR booth and say hi.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malc                </div>

                            I've read Cold City. It's nifty.<br/><br/>It has a trust system. It mirrors the fact that you need to trust your comrades, but you're pulled from different nationalities in a time of utmost distrust. You spread trust points around, and get conflict bonuses in cases where trust comes into play. They cut both ways though. It builds the feeling of tension.<br/><br/>You have personal and national agendas that you are following (and you get conflict roll bonuses for doing so), and those are always going to make getting the job done just that bit harder.<br/><br/>Malc was working on CC while I was working on Covenant, and you can tell we have similar thoughts. The way political and personal agendas pull at characters is part of both games.<br/><br/>He may have the edge though, he has zombie nazis!                        </div>

                            OK, a quick rundown on the mechanics and how they support the themes and aims of the game:<br/><br/>Characters are defined by 4 things:<br/><br/>Attributes (Action, Influence and Reason)<br/>Traits (broad based 'things that the character can do, aspects of their personality, etc. These can be positive and negative)<br/>Hidden Agendas (personal and national, these are real driving forces for the character)<br/>Trust (the trust they have in other and the trust other have in them)<br/><br/>In any conflict, you start your dice pool by selecting and appropriate attribute. If you can narratively bring a hidden agenda into play (in that the conflict serves to forward that hidden agenda), then you double the attribute. Positive traits add a die to the pool, negative traits take a die away. Finally, trust can add a number of dice equal to its level to the pool, if the situation means that you are trusting a comrade in that situation. trust can also be flipped and used for the betrayal of your comrades as well.<br/><br/>The conflcit resolution roll is made against the pool of the opposition, highest number winning. The greater the number of ice higher than the opponents highest number, the greater the level of success. This is reflected in the amount of narrative you get. One success means a 'slight' victory, where you don't fully get the stakes set out at the start of the conflict. This goes up to five success (a 'superlative' success) where you can narrate beyond what was set out in your initial stakes.<br/><br/>All conflicts result in consequences for both side, for success and failure. This can be the temporary modification of an attribute, flipping a trait (for example, changing a positive trait to a negative one) or gaining a new trait (either positive or negative). trust can also be changed at any point, depending on the actions of the characters (and it can go up and down).<br/><br/>The aim of this was to create a system that encouraged the use of hidden agendas and trust, refelcting the paranoia and mistrust of the Cold war era and the fact the the characters represent a group of different nationalities who may not always be working towards the same ends.<br/><br/>In play, when using hidden agendas, this would normally be done by passing a note to the GM or similiar. In a metagame sense, the players all know the other characters have hidden agendas they are working to forward but in a character sense, the characters are also aware that everyone has hidden agendas (or suspect that they have them), even if they do not know what they are. Again, this serves to highlight the atmosphere of the Cold war and the mutual suspicion that it fostered.<br/><br/>Hope this give a reasonable over view of how things work.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                        </div>
