It's very tactical/decision based, with lots of ways to manipulate your "luck." We've also done entire sessions with no combat, but the system really shines with its amazing combat... <br/><br/>Our main goal is to get the game out for people to start enjoying. The $29 with Free Shipping is pretty much at cost (POD).  If you want to score some cheaper Reaper Bones minis or SciFi dungeon tiles, we are offering those, too.  Feel free to pick my brain, even if you aren't going to back us. I love talking game design and will be checking back here often. <br/><br/><a href="http://kck.st/1Gk3lwl" rel="nofollow">Adventure Deck System: Luminosity</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
