What's not to love about a game that you can fit into 15 minutes? This is my first try at seriously creating some short games, also known as 'game poems', so there's  a whole new section of <a href="http://www.groundhoggoth.co.uk" rel="nofollow">the site</a> that contains not one, not two, but three brand new short games for you to try out. The first was played at <a href="http://www.conceptionuk.org/" rel="nofollow">Conception '13</a> and worked very well, the second is a cut down version of a mini-game previously available here and the third is something completely new which should appeal to all fans of Rich Burlew and the <a href="http://www.giantitp.com/" rel="nofollow">Order of the Stick!<br/></a><br/><b>Char. Gen:</b> This short game is most suitable for anyone who\u2019s played an RPG before and had issues with the character creation process; it\u2019s a comedy game in which everyone collaborates on creating a single character for an unnamed RPG.<br/><br/><b>Mystery of Life:</b> This short game has the potential to contain a lot of adult material and touch upon themes suitable only for a mature audience, so be sure everyone is on the same page before sitting down to play. The game takes place in a celestial courtroom, where the disposition of a newly deceased soul is being contested by an Angel and a Demon; will they go to Heaven or to Hell?<br/><br/><b>The Crayons of Time:</b> This short game is most suitable for anyone with an interest in fantasy fiction; it has a competitive element and can be played as either drama or comedy, or both! All the players are Gods who are going to collectively create a world, whilst trying to claim absolute authority over aspects of what is created without wrecking the whole creative process.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_405711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405711/#Comment_405711" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-08T02:56:20+00:00" title="February  8, 2013  2:56AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like great games, James!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
