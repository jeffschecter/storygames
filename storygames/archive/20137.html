At that time, I worked on a fantasy game that I called "Remos."  I wrote a lot for that game and got great feedback from folks. I found out about this place and signed up here, too. The community was great and Eero encouraged me a lot.  But I shelved Remos and focused on my career and life for awhile.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, the itch came back and I've been working on a sci-fi RPG called, "Luminosity."  You see, humanity came across a contagion, and it is something straight out of legend... it causes vampirism.  Now you're stuck in a sticky situation with failing equipment and you're trying to keep the lights on. Because any light weakens vamps and their pets, and if it goes pitch black, you're as good as dead.  Play is often like one of those sci-fi movies where they're stuck on a broken ship or remote base and there's aliens stalking the hallways. However, the system is flexible enough to do anything (even without the Luminosity mechanic). <br/><br/>The initial design focused on combat with a splash of skills.  Recently I've been working on expanding it so that it works well in RP situations.  There's a lot of unique things in this game that I'm excited about. For example, the GM takes a turn after each player.  It's broken up, so it isn't like a full "D&amp;D" gm turn, but it keeps the monsters reacting, the action moving, and helps the players feel like they're getting swarmed by monsters.  <br/><br/>So once again, hello everyone!                  </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444808/#Comment_444808" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-15T11:43:05+00:00" title="April 15, 2015 11:43AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good to see you keeping your toes wet in the rpg design hobby, David.<br/><br/>So it's sort of a zombie game with a tactical focus? I'm asking because it might be interesting to reflect upon prior art in the genre in the context of your own game - what you're doing differently, what strong points others have that you might want to preserve in your own take. There's been both pretty interesting tactical games as well as pretty interesting zombie games out in the wilds in the recent years, after all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DavidC" title="DavidC"><img alt="DavidC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DavidC">DavidC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444811/#Comment_444811" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-15T18:06:23+00:00" title="April 15, 2015  6:06PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could say that. I'd argue it's different from zombies because the enemies are fast and varied. Sentient creatures can turn into full fledged vampires, but lesser creatures turn into thralls of the vampires. I personally think it feels more like "Alien" the movies than a zombie flick. The creatures are divided up into archetypes. There's weak grunts that are fast and move in groups, there's strong tanks that work are each a big threat, there's ranged "shooters," and there's aberrants, creatures that have surprising abilities like invisibility or tentacles to grab you and drag you into the darkness. Then, there's also the vampires which usually serve as a boss encounter.<br/><br/> It does have a tactical focus. I've been trying to keep an eye on other similar games for reading/playing.  When you say there's been a lot of offerings lately, do you have any in specific you can think of?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444812/#Comment_444812" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-15T18:45:36+00:00" title="April 15, 2015  6:45PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That does totally sound like a recent zombie thingie, really <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> I'm thinking of stuff like say <i>Left 4 Dead</i>, a tactical survival fighting video game with various sorts of zombies and so on.<br/><br/>I'm not disputing the diegetic fact that these are vampires and not zombies (whether the semantics matter or not), just noting that this sort of thing has been in the zeitgeist lately, and it's good to realize that your closest comparison in terms of creative agenda (skirmish survival game with a variety of undead opponents) go under the label of "zombie genre" nowadays. It's not just slowly shambling hordes anymore, not really. Just like how <i>I am Legend</i> is considered a seminal zombie novel despite technically featuring vampires - the term "zombie" hadn't even been popularized when it was written.<br/><br/>In fact, just in case you've missed what pop culture thinks of zombies nowadays: go to <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/Zombie-games?acomplete=zombi&amp;sort=rating" rel="nofollow">the Kongregate "zombie" games genre category sorted by rating</a> and play half a dozen popular flash games about the subject matter. Won't take that long, and could jog some ideas and whatnot in terms of representation, terminology, etc.<br/><br/>Regarding tactical focus, what all this first and foremost resembles in my eyes is D&amp;D 4th edition. How familiar are you with that? (I could see everything you've said here as a setting for 4th edition D&amp;D, really, but of course it is possible to improve on the skirmish rpg recipe in major ways.) Were I working on a game along these lines, that would be my first concern, being a better and more fun tactical skirmish roleplaying game than 4th edition D&amp;D and similar games. (Totally possible to be better than these, but not trivial - 4th is a very sharp game in some ways, and a very dim one in others.)<br/><br/>Aside from the D&amp;D constellation, <i>Savage Worlds</i> is an obvious touchstone to consider. I'm not entirely happy at limiting myself to just miniatures games, as that solution <i>should</i> be just one option among many for tactical rpgs, but apparently the popularly mainstream of the genre runs that way.<br/><br/>Speaking of which: does your game use miniatures, or plain narration, or drawn mapping aids, or something else to deal with the tactical minutiae?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DavidC" title="DavidC"><img alt="DavidC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DavidC">DavidC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444814/#Comment_444814" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-15T21:02:30+00:00" title="April 15, 2015  9:02PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 15, 2015 9:02PM by DavidC.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, there's definitely a comparison to be made.  I guess I don't think of it as zombies because many of the enemies you fight aren't humanoid.  I've definitely seen and played a number of survival video games, including Left4Dead. In Luminosity, the classes of monsters are paired up to character archetypes.  The Marksman characters are good versus tanks, the heavy is good at mowing down shooters and grunts with his minigun and explosives, the gunslinger can counter abberrants' special attacks, while the close quarters specialist is great against grunts and for keeping enemies at bay. Loosely the D&amp;D analogues are that the gunslinger is a rogue, the marksman a mage, the heavy and cq are the fighter/tank.  Healing is a skill that requires resources (medkits), so everybody can do it a little, but usually someone specializes in it. <br/><br/>I'd dislike saying it's similar to 4E because I didn't find it fun.  It's in the same category, though.  It has a lot of similarities to Savage Worlds. Different weapons do different dice sizes like Savage Worlds. However, the minigun does 4 seperate d4s, allowing it to succeed lots of small attacks (grunts).  While the sniper does a single d8 (with more damage), allowing it to take care of tanks better. So small dice aren't necessarily worse, they just have a different application.   For skills, large dice are always better, though.  <br/><br/>The game is played with both miniatures and card decks. The miniatures are placed on room tiles, kind of like "Betrayal at house on the hill." This lets the GM set things up on the fly.  The board is pretty important to the tactics, because it matters a lot how close things are to you since they're mostly only melee and the CQ's job is to try and keep them from closing in on his/her allies. <br/><br/>I'll do a more full write up Friday, probably with pictures so you can see how everything is interacting.  <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444817/#Comment_444817" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-15T22:30:11+00:00" title="April 15, 2015 10:30PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to say that I'm personally on board with the idea of combining these creative interests:<br/><b>*</b> A tactical skirmish rpg like 4th edition D&amp;D or Savage Worlds, except better.<br/><b>*</b> A zombie survival setting with survival resources management, difficult choices and nasty monsters offed with whatever's on hand.<br/>I wonder why nobody's done that exact thing before - sounds like it could be pretty fun. I can see how the light thing, for instance, makes for a pretty intuitive tactical and strategic constraint. The strategic context in general is more suited to constant skirmishing than e.g. the dungeon exploration premise of D&amp;D, too.<br/><br/>But anyway, do ask if you feel a need for feedback or whatever. Sounds to me like you've got this thing well on hand, though. The part about needing to hit well above the quality of pre-existing rules systems (to make the project worth doing as something more than a Savage Worlds setting, I mean) feels daunting to me, but that's probably just because I'm not much of a skirmish miniatures game player, and consequently my ideas about how to streamline the genre tend to get pretty radical - and I'm aware enough to understand that this doesn't necessarily reflect what others would want out of something like this very well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444826/#Comment_444826" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-16T17:56:03+00:00" title="April 16, 2015  5:56PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 17, 2015 1:06PM by catty_big.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey David. Welcome back into roleplaying, and it looks like you've got yourself stuck in already with an intriguing new game concept.

One thing I've found out during "Remos" is that some concepts to "us" are so overdone and boring... but people new to the hobby like things they can instantly connect to. I think that's partly why things like Harry Potter and Twilight have been successful. They don't try and be "too clever" with the basic fantasy premise. They take something familiar and just develop it well. <br/><br/>I love your personal interpretation of the light idea!  I wish I could say that had been my intention from the beginning, but in truth I was just looking for a way to "increase the suspense" and I thought about how primal it is for us to be afraid of the dark. I had also been using candles with "Werewolf" with people blowing out their candles when they were killed, so as the werewolves got closer to winning, the darker it got.<br/><br/>Thanks for the warm welcome!                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
