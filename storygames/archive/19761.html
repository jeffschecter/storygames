LOS_The_Volcanic_Island.pdf and Last_One_Standing_Contestant_Set_One.pdf were quick enough, but Last_One_Standing_GM_Move_Sheet.pdf was very slow. Curious!<br/><br/>Looking inside the file, the quick files have a few jpg images but the slow one, the GM move sheet, even though as a PDF it's only 9.5M has 20 high-resolution 19M TIFF files on just the first page alone. One of them has the outer frame, the others are black boxes, one for every text block, is stored in this PDF as a full-page raster layer. This is something that PDFs can do quicker and faster with a little vector graphics, or at least one single layer rather than twenty.<br/>I didn\u2019t look further than the first page because I had my answer right there. No wonder the file was so slow.<br/><br/>I guess maybe the PDFs were exported from an raster image editing program, such as the GIMP or Photoshop.<br/><br/>The quick PDFs such as the Contestant set, just have low-resolution raster images instead of pages, that\u2019s why they\u2019re quick but that\u2019s also why they look bad printed out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438486/#Comment_438486" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-17T23:11:33+00:00" title="September 17, 2014 11:11PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, let's dive right in here.\n<blockquote>I don't really know anything about layout and PDF creation, but there's something wrong with your large PDFs.  Rendering them on my beefy PC is taking <i>way more</i> CPU than is reasonable and the text is painted in paragraph-sized chunks slowly as I watch.</blockquote>\nNeither do I, as evidenced by this! I'll look into that. Admittedly, I converted these to PDF without perhaps as much care as I should have done - they rendered fine on my machine so I figured they were good.\n<blockquote><br/>In your own play and rounds of playtest, how much of the game is just about the fight and how much about other aspects of life?<br/></blockquote>\nTypically, I've played this game as focusing almost entirely on the actual competition itself. Most of the time isn't spent <i>fighting</i>, particularly, so much as planning, making alliances, and exploring, but I haven't really tested/devoted much rules weight towards the outside aspects. This was intentional - the game is meant to be really focused on the tactical/action side of things, and I think there's already a lot of great games for the more character-focused side of things, heck, even in a very similar setting you have Classroom Deathmatch which is a lot more focused on that sort of thing. \n<blockquote>What design philosophy lead you to have a ton of basic moves for specific situations rather than a smaller handful of more general-purpose moves? That seems off-hand like a defect but maybe you have a great reason.</blockquote>\nI've gotten a lot of comments on this from experienced *-world players. My philosophy was that by explicitly calling out all the things you can do on the sheet, players will be more likely to do them. Also, it allows me to have specific results/consequences detailed right there. This is a fairness issue - I really love the *-world system for its open-endedness, but this game is also meant, in a sense, to be competitive and has a strong player-vs-player element. By putting the outcomes of failures almost entirely in GM hands, it can put the GM in a tough spot, essentially often 'choosing who wins' which isn't what you want in a PvP-Oriented game. <br/><br/>This is definitely a huge break from your apocalypse world or dungeon world. If the free-wheeling 'anything could happen' aspect is what you love about *-world games, you're not going to get as much of that here. Last One Standing is almost more like a series of 'adventure modules' than it is a totally open-ended RPG system, and that obviously has its pros and cons. I think that there really aren't a lot of games that fill that niche, which is why I made Last One Standing, but that may not be what you're looking for. \n<blockquote>When a PC is "considered" a friend of another, considered by whom? What is that doing in the fiction?</blockquote>\nIn the fiction, characters who are considered friends probably act friendly. It's mostly meant as a mechanical flag to give bite to the move where you have to roll to betray a friend. It's specified the way it is so that two characters can act friendly or be merely allies but not consider each other friends and have to roll to 'betray' each other. On a more stat-balance level, it's mechanical weight gives personality-focused characters a bit more 'defense' against more combat-oriented characters.<br/>\n<blockquote>How long does the game take? Is this only played as a one-shot?</blockquote>\nWith 20 contestants the game takes roughly 4 hours or so - about one game session. I typically play it as a one-shot, but if you delve into the outside the game and add more contestants you could easily spin things into a short campaign or at least a series of connected one-shots. I have mostly tested on and envision it as a one-shot oriented game, though.<br/>\n<blockquote>I don't generally like moves that call for a player to roll plus one of several stats, their choice. Where you do that, is it supposed to inform the fiction or what?</blockquote>\nIt can definitely inform the fiction, but I mostly implemented those moves as, again, a bit of a 'character balance' thing. I'm actually quite fond of 'choose a stat' moves in general, so I think we may just differ on opinions there.<br/>\n<blockquote>You've included pregenerated character sets and make it seem like that's the way to play, but also included rules for character creation. Even those are pretty thin -- seemingly all tactical. I wonder if this simply points to the board-game nature of the game. Like, I'm looking at this entirely from the perspective of an RPG, but that's really not the right frame of reference. Thoughts? Do you think others might have the same sort of dissonance that I initially had? </blockquote>\nThe dissonance is definitely an issue, yes. Honestly, I consider the game to almost be more like a 'customizable board game that happens to run on an RPG ruleset' than it is an RPG, but I don't really know where the exact distinction lies there. As for characters being all tactical, this is actually somewhat intentional - I find that, with random pre-gens and frequent character death being the 'default' way to play, leaving characters as a rough sketch allows players to take a loose outline and run with it, which I think is quite a bit harder if a character has a lot of depth to them. \n<blockquote>I have to ask, if you wanted a non-narrative, rules-medium game, why did you start with the PbtA engine as a basis?</blockquote>\nWell to be entirely honest I didn't start with the PbtA - originally I was using a more traditional d6 roll-under system. I just really love the PbtA system and thought that adapting its general framework would lead to a lot more interesting game than just using a more trad system. An argument could probably be made that I'm missing the best parts of the system, but the way I see it, I'm taking the parts I need and leaving the rest behind, and I think the game is better for it, even if it's a fairly radical departure from other implementations of the system.\n<blockquote>(Also, what's up with the sexism in a lot of your pregen characters?)</blockquote>\nI was trying to draw on classic high-school movie tropes for a lot of the pre-gens in order to give them easy roles people could pick up on a moment's notice. No sexism was intended, although it could probably be argued that such 'archetypes' are inherently sexist.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe" title="Caoimhe"><img alt="Caoimhe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe">Caoimhe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438491/#Comment_438491" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-17T23:52:14+00:00" title="September 17, 2014 11:52PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess that answers my question, because it seems like basically you stripped out every single thing that makes PbtA games interesting and awesome, and only kept the "roll 2d6+ability, 7-9 for conditional success, 10+ for full success" mechanic and absolutely nothing else.<br/><br/>Quite frankly I would be embarrassed, if I were you, to claim it's Powered by the Apocalypse since it so clearly violates every single piece of design philosophy that goes into a good PbtA game like Apocalypse World, Monsterhearts, Dungeon World, and so on. It's not just a poor implementation of PbtA, it seems to be philosophically opposed to everything that PbtA really stands for.<br/><br/>I don't get how, for example, the GM can be a fan of the characters when they're all disposable and trying to kill each other. On a basic level, the system of "succeed on 7+" really doesn't work if the GM can't be trusted to make sure things are interesting rather than awful.<br/><br/>I don't understand why you are using an elegant system like PbtA and then having over 20 different basic moves to resolve basically the same thing. <br/><br/>I'm lost as to why you provide pregens that fit a bunch of sexist tropes when the PbtA games on which you base your creation are scrupulously diligent in their inclusiveness of all genders and people. <br/><br/>I don't even understand why you think it's a good idea to hand people a complete name, background, personality, and stats when it literally takes a minute or two of circling words in a playbook to generate a new character. <br/><br/>And why no playbooks? It's certainly not because you're shying away from archetypes -- your characters are all archetypal to the point of being offensive stereotypes. All men are either macho alpha males or wimpy omega males, all women are either virgins or whores, so why not just make those the playbooks?<br/><br/>Where are the bonds or hooks or strings or whatever, so essential for the way most other PbtA work together and which represent something very vital to the whole dramatic underpinnings behind the source material in "Hunger Games," namely the emotional connections formed between the various participants.<br/><br/>Basically I don't understand this kickstarter at all. There's so much potential for "Hunger Games -- Powered by the Apocalypse!" that would be awesome, and I think a lot of your backers are probably looking just at that six sentence concept and seeing that potential, but if they look closer they'll see all that potential is squandered.<br/><br/>I'm sorry to be so down on your game, but I just don't get it at all. I mean, you've clearly made the game you want to make and I wish you luck with it, but it feels like it would have been more honest to just stick with your d6-and-roll-under system and not try to sell it using the PbtA cachet.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438495/#Comment_438495" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-18T05:52:39+00:00" title="September 18, 2014  5:52AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2014 5:53AM by ChristopherWeeks.">edited September 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think my systemic skepticism with the game stems pretty much entirely from my thinking that it's an RPG.

It's not just a poor implementation of PbtA, it seems to be philosophically opposed to everything that PbtA really stands for.</blockquote>\nPersonally I feel like, despite being a fairly radical departure from the core implementation, that it still keeps enough of the philosophy to be called a PbtA game. But being as different as it is you may well not like it, which is fine! Plenty of other games to play if you were looking for a different kind of game, which it seems you are!\n<blockquote>I don't even understand why you think it's a good idea to hand people a complete name, background, personality, and stats when it literally takes a minute or two of circling words in a playbook to generate a new character. </blockquote>\nA minute or two over and over adds up. Not to mention this makes all your NPCs in advance. The other thing I find is that by handing someone a pre-gen, they're not as attached to the character, which is actually ideal for a game frequently featuring character death. Even when warned in advance it can be really disappointing to create a character and have them die a few minutes later - and that's a core element to what makes this game interesting and different, to me.\n<blockquote>And why no playbooks? It's certainly not because you're shying away from archetypes -- your characters are all archetypal to the point of being offensive stereotypes. All men are either macho alpha males or wimpy omega males, all women are either virgins or whores, so why not just make those the playbooks?</blockquote>\nI'm not shying away from archetypes it's true. As for all the characters being archetypal to the point of being offensive stereotypes - the final game is going to have 100 characters, and most of them aren't nearly as stereotypical as the ones in the free version. Now, I'll admit I may not have made the best choice on which ones to include in the free version, but so it goes, I suppose. As for making playbooks, that's not a bad idea! I might do just that at some point down the line. \n<blockquote>I'm sorry to be so down on your game, but I just don't get it at all. I mean, you've clearly made the game you want to make and I wish you luck with it, but it feels like it would have been more honest to just stick with your d6-and-roll-under system and not try to sell it using the PbtA cachet.</blockquote>\nNo problem. It's not for everyone. And I feel like I am being honest in my association with the PtbA cachet - I say that it's a heavily modified version, and it is. One of the great parts of the system, to me, is how flexible it is - as evidenced by how wildly the adaptations of it play. This is just a spin in a different direction than the others.\n<blockquote>I think my systemic skepticism with the game stems pretty much entirely from my thinking that it's an RPG.  When I think of it as an open-ended, refereed board game, that basically evaporates.</blockquote>\nThis is actually a really great way of putting it, and a pretty good representation of what it's like in play. I've just found that the setup and such are RPG-like enough that it's more useful to refer to it as an RPG first, but I'll keep 'open-ended, refereed board game' in mind if I need more specific terminology.

Or can I pretty much play without that, and the question of how much acting etc. to do is largely a matter of group and player taste?"  <br/><br/>Like, if we didn't feel like doing too much scene setting and character acting, could we finish in 90 minutes?<br/><br/>As for "Powered by the Apocalypse", I don't think this game accords with what people expect when they see that label.

Certainly, when I've run it it's been in an RPG-like time slot. <br/><br/>I feel like it would be possible to get the game down to a more board game-like time slot by going very light on the roleplaying elements and maybe switching up the games' expectations a bit, but I definitely built it with a more typical RPG-like time slot in mind. I haven't tested it, but now you've got me really wanting to try seeing how a really stripped-down, even more board-gamey version would play!<br/><br/>Label-wise, yeah I can see how people could feel like it's somewhat misleading. For me, although I've played a bit of apocalypse world, I'm mostly familiar with the PbtA system through Dungeon World. Maybe the way the groups I've been in and how I've ran Dungeon World were atypical, but I ran it as a very high-action, freewheeling game that focused less on the specifics of roleplaying and character drama and more on the crazy chain of events created by the results of moves and their consequences.<br/><br/>In that sense, I feel like Last One Standing captures that same feel - the mechanics backing up the fiction, the whole paradigm of play that the move structure creates, and the 6-/7-9/10+ success structure being the main things it keeps. Those alone, for me, make a world of difference in how the game plays compared with a more traditional system that just models a fictional reality - although in the same way, just using those elements puts it pretty far from how many people seem to play PbtA games, which is very heavily narratively focused. <br/><br/>I guess it just goes to show that the same system can mean a lot of different things depending on who you talk to, who you play with, and what they're maybe looking for the system to be capable of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/revel911" title="revel911"><img alt="revel911" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/revel911">revel911</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438538/#Comment_438538" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-19T05:23:36+00:00" title="September 19, 2014  5:23AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 19, 2014 5:27AM by revel911.">edited September 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Personally I feel like, despite being a fairly radical departure from the core implementation, that it still keeps enough of the philosophy to be called a PbtA game.

You were the GM, so you interrupted the game how it best suited your style. Which is no RP and a lot of killing, which I am not saying is wrong. I am just saying the system is not best suited for. There is a reason why this game has Bonds, HX, debt, strings whatever .... it helps tie the players together than most games do not care about.<br/><br/>I am not saying you won't get funded, but I would pull the game and rework it pushing it further. Even if you just want the multi-tier dice rolling system and basic moves, your basic moves need be reworked and drastically decreased allowing the MC and players ability to play a smooth game.<br/><br/>I will not be backing ..... and I back almost ALL games PbtA like a Lemming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438542/#Comment_438542" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-19T07:26:13+00:00" title="September 19, 2014  7:26AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I am sorry to see a lot of the comments seem insulting, but it is hard not too even for myself when this comment shows how little you actually understand about World games and what the point of even using the PbtA system means.

I get that for a lot of people, that's the killer app of a PbtA system and if that's what you're looking for you'll be disappointed. That said, I consider the way that using moves instead of a traditional action system frames the gameplay is a totally different way of playing, and that, since I use that structure, it still feels very distinct in a way I associate with PbtA games. <br/><br/>As for the amount of basic moves, I feel like it's more of a presentation problem, maybe. Dungeon World, for example has 21 moves on its sheet between basic and special moves. I have 23 -  but no class/playbook, so in play, it'll actually feel like less. Calling them all 'basic moves' instead of splitting them into basic/special or some other paradigm seems to have confused people - it was intended to avoid throwing one more term at new players - and I'll look into changing it to make things more clear.<br/><br/>The other reason there's so many moves is because the game is built to have a lot of PvP, and I think that presenting all the rules clearly and upfront helps avoid hurt feelings when players come head to head. This isn't a concern that other PbtA games have, so that's another factor to take into account. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438551/#Comment_438551" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-19T10:13:09+00:00" title="September 19, 2014 10:13AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The criticism of calling this a PbtA game seems a bit harsh to me.
