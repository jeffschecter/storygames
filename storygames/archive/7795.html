Rather than discuss there (where the OP is quite unwilling), I am making a new thread.<br/>---------<br/>In the US, a creative work is not "owned" by the creator, it is protected against infringement of sales for a given period of time, after which it releases to the public domain. Over the years, that time's gotten longer and longer (now it's Life + 25 years, IIRC), but the Framers never intended IP to be locked away or lost forever--quite the opposite, having seen the results of English laws which had steadily resulted in lost works.<br/><br/>I quote (from a <a href="http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_8s12.html" rel="nofollow">Thomas Jefferson letter</a> (highlighting mine):\n<blockquote>If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which <b>an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it</b>. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me. <b>That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature</b>, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density in any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property. Society may give an exclusive right to the profits arising from them, as an encouragement to men to pursue ideas which may produce utility, but this may or may not be done, according to the will and convenience of the society, without claim or complaint from anybody. </blockquote>\nSo note: if you get an ISBN for your game and send it to the Library of Congress, it will be on shelves waiting for public domain release, indefinitely. In a similar fashion, after Life + 25 years, anyone who wants to setup a press may print, distribute, and sell it (barring some estate blocking, viz Tolkien estate).<br/><br/>It could be argued that taking action to physically remove the work from the public space necessarily grants others the right to provide that work, again, so that IP is not lost forever but preserved to educate, inspire, and enlighten all, forever.<br/><br/>Discuss. Save flames for your unsold stacks. :P                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172794/#Comment_172794" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T08:53:10+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  8:53AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 3, 2008 8:56AM by Matt Snyder.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, are you arguing that, counter to actual law, if someone who does <i>not</i> transfer rights for their IP but does remove physical objects and copies, that others have the <i>right</i> to that person's IP? That seems extremely silly, and probably illegal, to me.<br/><br/>Quoting Thomas Jefferson letters rank right up there with conservative Christians "proving" to everyone that we're fundamentally a Christian nation and that, shucks, we really should all just Praise God. It's political jive.<br/><br/>Here is some more quoting. It's section 106 of the <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html" rel="nofollow">1976 Copyright Act</a>, with more fun bolding I added: \n<blockquote><br/>Subject to sections 107 through 122, the owner of copyright under this title has the <b>exclusive rights</b> to do and to authorize any of the following:<br/><br/>(1) <b>to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies</b> or phonorecords;<br/><br/>(2) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;<br/><br/>(3) <b>to distribute copies</b> or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending;<br/><br/>(4) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works, to perform the copyrighted work publicly;<br/><br/>(5) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, including the individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, to display the copyrighted work publicly; and<br/><br/>(6) in the case of sound recordings, to perform the copyrighted work publicly by means of a digital audio transmission.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nSome more interesting sections. From definitions: \n<blockquote>\u201cCopies\u201d are material objects, other than phonorecords, in which a work is fixed by <b>any method now known or later developed, and from which the work can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine</b> or device. The term \u201ccopies\u201d includes the material object, other than a phonorecord, in which the work is first fixed.</blockquote>\nArguments counter to these pricipals are illegal. It appears to me that your claim is indeed counter to these author rights.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172795/#Comment_172795" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T08:53:34+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  8:53AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's really cool, actually.

It would be illegal, yes, but if someone really HAS to have them I don't think it will be stopped by this. But, if you can do this, what do you want even more with these threads? Matt's permission?

And, for which any such discussion is decided in courts? <br/><br/>It seems to me that law amply covers an indie publisher who ceases publication and removes his or her products from distribution (as I have done). What is there to discuss? It seems to me that largely we'd be discussing one or two things: <br/><br/>1) Whether or not we understand existing copyright law.<br/><br/>2) Whether or not we <i>like</i> existing copyright law. <br/><br/>Because, we don't seem to be likely or even able to change said law with any discussion here. <br/><br/>For purposes of discussion, 1) I have a reasonable layman's grasp on the law. I'm not a lawyer. 2) I don't really know how to answer that question. I like that the law protects my intellectual propery very much. I don't like that, say, it protects Disney's forever so long as they have lobbysists. But, whatever. The point is discussing whether we like it doesn't change the fact that someone in my situation does not relinquish his rights by no longer selling PDFs online.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172810/#Comment_172810" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T09:23:15+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  9:23AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it's worth, I don't think the knee-jerk reaction some of us (including me) are having is about Matt at all.

I resent that Disney funded lobbiest have ass raped copyright law to the extent of giving IP nearly indefinite protection.<br/>\n<br/>\nPublic Domain is good.  All works should move into the public domain quicker then they do today.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ONLY ONLY ONLY reason to grant protection to IP (whether Patents or Copyrights) is to give the originator sufficient time to cash in and profit from their idea before others begin to use it...but the intention was (and should be) that others would have full permission to use it after a reasonable time has past.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow in the meantime...before it passes into public domain, the copy right / patent holder does have the rights granted under those respective laws.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut now I'm going go a little into my personal philosophy.  This isn't law, I'm not about to express any legal right that I have.  But I am going to express what I think *should* be my legal right (and would be if I were dicatator of universe).<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that with every right comes obligation.  IMO (again this is not legal opinion, its my personal feelings on the matter) a creator who has the right to their IP also, having once made that IP publically available, has the obligation to keep it publically available in some fashion.  Great works of art should be freely turned into prints and sold to those who'd like to have the art on their wall -- should freely be reproduced in images in Art History text books so that anyone interested can view and enjoy them.  Now I don't think that's true of art kept to yourself, or commissioned from one person to another directly...but once its made public...I think the public has an ongoing right to have it remain available to them.  Again...this is my philosophical belief, not the law (I wish it was the law, but its not).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat that means to me is that if a piece of art is available to be through legitimate sources, that I have the obligation as a good citizen to use those legitimate sources if I wish to enjoy that art.  But should that art no longer be available through legitimate sources, I feel I should still have the right to enjoy that art, and if that means using less legimate sources to do so, I have no moral qualms about it (it may still be illegal, but IMO its not wrong).<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this "entitlement"?<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, it is.  I think every human being is entitled to enjoy and continue to enjoy creative works once those works have been made public.

You can argue that Jefferson's words aren't the law, but you can't say they're silly or merely political. I think Jefferson has a really good point there, and very well argued. They obviously don't change your rights, but that still doesn't mean that the old guy does not have some pretty good points there. And they're not merely opinions, either.

TONS of shit goes off the market and becomes inaccessible all the time in this hobby industry. <br><br>Pour out a little liquor for those dead games:<br>Justifiers<br>Shattered Sky<br>The End<br>Code of Unaris<br>BESM<br>Cold Steel Reign<br>The Mountain Witch<br>Synnibar<br>Shatterzone<br>Dark Sun<br>Space: 1889<br>the list goes on and on<br><br>Now, some of the above were financial explosions like BESM.<br>And others are still available in some PDF form (The End, TMW), but it is no longre possible to communicate with the designer, get a print copy, etc.<br><br>In all the cases above, the owners of the property sloughed off. Code of Unaris came out just 3-4 years ago, same as Cold Steel Reign: They both had fancy websites, support, communities, etc. They simply fucked off and died, leaving no trace, no possibilities of others being able to get a hold of their games by print or PDF (in this internet era and all; which is different than say Justifiers/Shattered Sky, which were born before all that).<br><br/>The only difference is that Matt is saying it straight up, rather than simply retreating from the world. Rather than exploding and diving out of the internet entirely, he's dropped the message that sales have stopped. The results are the same, in the end. It's just that in Matt's case, we have a heads up beforehand, without simply seeing all the websites go offline and Matt becoming unresponsive, etc.<br/><br/>So I'm not sure why people are making such a big deal out of this already: This has been happening all the time from the beginning of our hobby (books drying up and becoming unavailable). It's just in this case, we've been told up front. And there was no spectacular financial failure involved.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172821/#Comment_172821" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T09:50:30+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  9:50AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 3, 2008 9:50AM by Ben_Lehman.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, David: 25 years after Matt's death, I intend to reprint Nine Worlds.

Out of politeness, I not only opened the matter for discussion, but tried hard to make it "agnostic" (I should have prolly not mentioned the other thread at all, in retrospect; but I'm sure the association would have been made anyway).<br/><br/>So, that said... let's not discuss Matt's decision. Let's stick with the basic points presented by Jefferson and others since (even though mere talk doesn't change policy, it DOES change minds... who can then lobby to change policy).<br/>-----<br/>I presented a basic argument, summarized as follows (if<i> I'm</i> following it right):<br/>* It is presumed that an idea is of value to the world and its people.<br/>* We want ideas to be disseminated, to provide maximum utility (maximum "good," to be sloppier).<br/>* To ensure that, we protect IP for various periods of time--providing a creator monopoly--to incentivize taking the effort to create and distribute.<br/>* An idea that is presumably valuable is not "taken" when it is learned by another--the idea remains the creator's (or rather, remains everyone's) and more importantly, that physical manuscript is still locked tight int he creator's safe.<br/>* Should a creator wish to destroy an idea, that is preventable via copying.<br/>* It is believed that destruction of useful ideas is to be avoided, for the good of humanity.<br/>Therefore, should a creator attempt (or even risk) destruction of an idea, it is a moral duty to preserve the idea, using whatever means are available and affordable.<br/><br/>This was of interest to the Framers (the most-easily-found quote I provide above; there are several to read; and, no, they might not all be "right" but they sort of had the idea for this country) because they had seen quite a few travesties of IP injustice, including loss of works forever (unforseen death, fires destroying masters and copies, etc) and enforcement of monopoly on works far beyond the life of the creator (backed by a form of extortion by the bookmakers of the time--this was a bigger issue pre-cheap-press).<br/><br/>And I opened the floor for discussion of that notion, as a moral argument in both directions--obligation to creators to encourage sharing of work, and obligation to society to disseminate work to insure against loss.<br/><br/>I did NOT open the floor to being insulted by incensed "creators" who can only read "copy = steal... FUCK YOU FUCKTARD!!!!!11one1!!!". The current law is moot to this potential topic (if it's not already destroy by the UnZen Brigade); and my own opinions are only orthogonally related to this topic (I, in fact, have a whole schedule of IP rights based on the nature of and social import of the IP... I'll share it in another thread, if anyone gives a rat's ass--doubtful, as I am "obviously" a fucktard....)<br/><br/>**sigh**                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172829/#Comment_172829" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T09:59:02+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  9:59AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, hell, forgot a bullet:<br/>* If the creator cease distribution, there is no loss of revenue and, thus, the monopoly should not be enforceable.<br/><br/>That one's kinda key to the argument....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Yokomizo" title="Daniel Yokomizo"><img alt="Daniel Yokomizo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Yokomizo">Daniel Yokomizo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172842/#Comment_172842" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T10:51:46+00:00" title="October  3, 2008 10:51AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 3, 2008 10:52AM by Daniel Yokomizo.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What we do know:\n<ul>\n<li>Copyright does grant a limited (albeit extending) monopoly over the work copyrighted. In the USA it's currently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Term_Extension_Act" rel="nofollow">life plus 70 years</a> for creator-owned material and 95 years after publication for corporate-owned material. So Ben, unless you want to break the law (or negotiate some rights from Matt) you'll need to wait longer than that.</li>\n<li>After that it goes from the public domain, irregardless of the existence of a copy in the library of the congress or not.</li>\n<li>If a work is out of market but still under copyright protection nobody can't touch it without negotiating the rights from the holders, be it the corporation, the creator or its estate.</li>\n<li>Creators have no way to prohibit something from going to public domain after the time passed (well, except if they're called Disney) or have any creative control over it after they're dead; the Amber stories written after Zelazny died are an example of this.</li>\n<li>Consumers, the community, or whatever you may want to call it, has no legal rights over a copyrighted work, other than the right to use it if they bought it (and resell, etc.) and the right to wait until it goes to the public domain.</li>\n</ul>\nWhat do I think:\n<ul>\n<li>Creators don't exist in a vacuum, we "steal" ideas from each other, be it in the same medium or different ones.</li>\n<li>Many (if not most or all) creators benefit from public domain material (e.g. illustrations in from old books). Lack of public domain material hurts us all, because it limits what we can do<sup>1</sup>. The more copyrighted works exist the larger the probability of infringement, Shazam was considered an infringement of Superman (for example) even though the character has sufficient merits on its own. Even when one isn't infringing the threat of litigation is sufficient to withdraw a product, specially when you don't have enough money to pursue.</li>\n<li>I think that the current system's length is too silly; if I build and sell a car to a cab driver I don't think I'm entitled to a share of the cab driver profits for my life plus 70 years, why should another piece of work I create deserve so much more rights? I have nothing against more time limited copyright arrangements.</li>\n<li>It's crazy to argue against "entitlement" and refuse to see that many people do enjoy and learn and become better persons when they enjoy works of art. If keeping a work available benefits many but removing it from (legal) acquisition channels benefits few, it isn't unreasonable to argue for it's availability. Many expressed in this and the other thread about how the creator should have absolute control of his work and people should be happy just to live in the same world, but if people benefit from the work they have incentives to want its continued availability, simple psychology; if you don't like to hear people complaining or talking about infringing your rights then either sue them or make something that nobody enjoys (and doesn't care if it goes away forever). Releasing something to the public creates a relationship (or whatever you may call it) and creates certain expectations; there's no legal obligations to fulfill people's expectations but ignoring this is irrational.</li>\n<li>It's a shame to see works become unavailable. I stopped gaming in 2002 and just a few months ago I become involved again, right now I'm reading Polaris, IAWA, Shock, Mortal Coil, Agon, PTA, and DRYH, if any of these authors had decided to make these unavailable, I would never had the chance to buy those legally (or even read a copy, as here in Brazil there isn't many owners of indie games).</li>\n</ul>\n<sub>1 Actually I'm not entirely convinced by this argument myself, because art and design thrives on constraints, so instead of writing a Superman lookalike we can always create something new and more (or less) interesting.</sub> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172845/#Comment_172845" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T11:05:48+00:00" title="October  3, 2008 11:05AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 3, 2008 11:06AM by Andy.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, since we're talking about intellectual property and founding fathers, I found this interesting piece of verbiage from the statesman and founding father of <i>my</i> world, Ron Jeremy:<br/><br/>"The public needs to understand that piracy is killing the adult industry", Jeremy said: \u201cWhat harms the industry is the Internet.

Yes, ideas have value, but protection is not protection of ideas, it's protection of expressions (writings, visual art, whatevah) of the idea.  I can write a game right now at this very second that uses one or many of Dust Devils' "ideas", and so can anyone. What I can't do is take the work others have done in expressing, illustrating and packaging that idea. That is the value that copyright protects, whatever its intent was.<br/><br/>Similarly, the "creator" can't withdraw their idea from the market, only the expression of the idea.  Given how ideas occur (they come from the easily accessible formula of existing conditions + time), it seems bizarre to me to worry "what if a creator's ideas <b>disappear</b>?!?!"  Vanishingly few creators or idea-originators come up with ideas that are so far removed from existing conditions that there's a danger no one will come up with the same idea, or a better one, at or near to the same time - and if they do, the ideas are so out of touch with what the rest of us are thinking and doing that they normally aren't of great value.<br/><br/>So even before you get to the weirder conclusions, this just doesn't work.

Part of the intent behind copyright is to <i>protect</i> the author. If the author wishes to remove the material, that's their right. <br/>2. Part of the intent behind copyright is to <i>encourage</i> authors: it is in place, like patent law, to encourage innovation and the creation of these ideas.<br/><br/>Let's take a hypothetical where I create a work and then decide later it is <i>immoral</i> (perhaps it is unintentionally racist?).

Disagree with them, fine--offer alternate premises.<br/><br/>That particular set of statements uses a general term "idea" for a whole host of things--engineered items, math models, political approaches... and unique creative works. Yes, we could cobble together the root systems of an RPG and "rewrite" it and have "the idea". But that disregards the additional illumination and explication that came from the creator's own mouth--equally, if not more, valuable with a seminal creative work.<br/><br/>Consider, for instance, Tolkien. There's no doubt that scores of writers (fiction and RPG) totally rip off his ideas. I can write about "Halfway Earth" and "Delves" and so forth and use every idea in Tolkien's body of work... but I won't have TOLKIEN. I won't have the imagery and inspiration and unique presentation. I'll have "Folkien." Now, by your points, you'd say it's fine if the Tolkien estate destroys all the original manuscripts and viciously prosecutes any who try to reprint, essentially letting the (fragile, destructible) copies waste away until, one day, it is impossible to read Tolkien, right? And that's OK, because it's a protected IP?<br/><br/>Then you beg the question of my two premises which you quote... and of course we don't agree. And you don't agree with some of (arguably) the most intellectual, creative, and legal-minded folks of two centuries ago. (But then again, looking at how fragile the system they built is proving to be, perhaps folks have good cause to denigrate their concerns and statements.)<br/><br/>So it comes down to value and the rights of society (recall that very few creations can come into being in isolation, without some societal support systems). You would seem to argue that, no, we don't need or deserve or gain any real benefit to humanity, from Tolkien and other unique creative works. I disagrree.

Matt's decision, and the thread he began, was simply the catalyst.<br/>For a long time I pretty seriously believed that copyright laws should be completely abolished.  I no longer believe this, but I do very strongly believe they need some major, major reforms.<br/>I'm a long, long way from being an expert in copyright law, but it is a topic I care about quite a lot.<br/>So that is why I brought it up.  I'm not trying to justify anything.<br/><br/>Simple points I'd like to make:<br/>Not all laws are good.  Some people in this thread are talking as though the simple fact that something is the law means that's the way it <b>ought</b> to be.  We can discuss whether or not current copyright laws are good and proper.  That sounds awesome.  But don't try to rebut someone's arguments by saying that actions taken based on their position are against current law.  That only proves it would be illegal, not that it would be <b>wrong or harmful</b>.<br/><br/>Questions of right and wrong and harm aside: the internet has created a new world.  When people these days want something, they want it NAAAOOOW!  I remember reading in the paper about parents who allowed their high school aged kids to skip school so they could camp out to wait for the new Halo game or the new video game console or whatever the hell.  So, regardless of whether it's right, wrong or whatever for a copyright holder to eliminate all legitimate, legal ways for acquiring a work, one thing that doing so is likely to result in is a major increase in illegitimate acquisitions of the work.<br/><br/>Cory Doctorow.  To quote from someone more recent.  Granted, his views focus on novels and fiction, specifically, since that's what he creates, but an argument for their applicability to other creative works could certain be made.<br/>I'll quote his paragraph about "the moral case" but the whole thing from his <i>Little Brother</i> page on <a href="http://craphound.com/littlebrother/about/#freedownload" rel="nofollow">why he gives e-books away</a> is worth taking a glance at.  it's not like it's that long:\n<blockquote>Finally, let\u2019s look at the moral case. Copying stuff is natural. It\u2019s how we learn (copying our parents and the people around us). My first story, written when I was six, was an excited re-telling of Star Wars, which I\u2019d just seen in the theater. Now that the Internet \u2014 the world\u2019s most efficient copying machine \u2014 is pretty much everywhere, our copying instinct is just going to play out more and more. There\u2019s no way I can stop my readers, and if I tried, I\u2019d be a hypocrite: when I was 17, I was making mix-tapes, photocopying stories, and generally copying in every way I could imagine. If the Internet had been around then, I\u2019d have been using it to copy as much as I possibly could.<br/><br/>There\u2019s no way to stop it, and the people who try end up doing more harm than piracy ever did. The record industry\u2019s ridiculous holy war against file-sharers (more than 20,000 music fans sued and counting!) exemplifies the absurdity of trying to get the food-coloring out of the swimming pool. If the choice is between allowing copying or being a frothing bully lashing out at anything he can reach, I choose the former.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172875/#Comment_172875" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T12:03:09+00:00" title="October  3, 2008 12:03PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marco</cite>Let's take a hypothetical where I create a work and then decide later it is<i>immoral</i>(perhaps it is unintentionally racist?).

(Also see: abortion, politic, D&amp;D, ... ^_^)<br/><br/>But I do think it's an interesting topic and hey, I have nothing better to do.<br/><br/>-------------------------<br/><br/>Personally, I'm a dirty hippy as far as IP is concerned. In my perfect fantasy world, most people would use one various open license or other and sharing ideas would not only be accepted but cherished and supported. Of course, that's not how it works in real life.<br/><br/>At the moment, the increasing lockdown of IP, with ever extending copyright terms and so on, is something I think will ultimately harm society, though to what extent... who knows. So while I support the basic idea of copyright/IP (ie. give the original creater time to actually profit from his work), as it works now and seems to develop into the future is not something I'd support.<br/><br/>Of course, in a way this is somewhat moot in the face of a world with ever increasing internet speeds and ever-growing hard disks and where piracy is just another fact of life. If you put something online, somebody will pirate it, whether it's expensive or free, pdf or a hardcover bound in the skin of virgin redheads. So, in a way, even with the ever-growing lockdown, it was never as easy to spread ideas around as it is now.<br/><br/>(I've always found that kinda weird and I'm wondering whether those two "poles" work like Yin/Yang, two opposite pieces of the same whole constantly chasing each other for the amusement of the Tao or something... ^_^)<br/><br/>One thing I've noticed is that, in my head, I make this strange distinction between access to a work/an idea and profiting from it. I've also seen this in other people, where somebody who has metric shittons of warez and ripped stuff would never even think to sell this or take credit for it. <br/><br/>Well, as you can see this is nothing that's ever going to be "finished" in my head, too much constant change all around us.

One good thing to do, if you'd care to try, is by attributing to me, at least, the ability to know whether or not i'm "raging."<br/><br/>I'm not entirely sure you understand what the term "censorship" means, because neither of the things you mentioned are actually censorship.  Charging money for something certainly isn't, and censorship doesn't apply to something that hasn't been published (as in the case of putting something on the internet, but blocking it with a password).  To say the second example is "censorship" is akin to saying that preventing someone from reading my private journal is censorship.<br/>However, the first example you made, wherein you described publishing a work (or, looking at the post, I notice you didn't actually say the work was published, but if it wasn't, "suppression" would hardly be necessary) and then later decide it is, for some reason, bad or inappropriate, and attempt to remove it from circulation.  This is definitely censorship.  Just as if <i>someone else</i> decide the book you wrote was bad or inappropriate and attempted to ban sales or remove it from libraries it would be censorship.

Not just uninformed debate about copyright law on a thread that isn't about copyright. Is this a first?<br/><br/>Some useful links:<br/>* <a href="http://www.rexx.com/~jaguar/copyright.html" rel="nofollow">Copyright FAQ</a> (by By Mel. White &amp; Glen Wooten)<br/>* <a href="http://www.templetons.com/brad/copymyths.html" rel="nofollow">10 Big Myths about copyright explained</a><br/>* <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/" rel="nofollow">U.S. Copyright Office -- FAQ</a><br/><br/><br/>What the Framers intended is only part of the picture. In the late 1800's, copyright law went through a pretty drastic reform, shifting from publisher protection to author protection. <br/><br/>The Berne Convention admits a "moral" copyright for the author. That is, an author owns a set of rights to something as soon as he expresses it in a fixed form. Those rights give the creator protections over the integrity of the work. This is what makes it possible for Heart to get McCain and Palin to stop using "Barracuda" on the campaign trail. Heart doesn't want those people using their song; they feel it violates their work's integrity. If art is a form of free speech, then protecting how your art is used is how you keep your free speech from being subverted. <br/><br/>The Berne Convention is a standard used internationally for copyright law. The U.S., in its crazy maverick way, only uses the parts of the Berne Convention that it likes, but it does admit certain moral copyrights. Where some countries grant copyright to an author as soon as she creates something, the U.S. provides exceptions such as "work for hire," in which the default assumption is that your employer owns what you made (without an explicit license necessary).<br/><br/>Removing one's own art from the public view is not censorship. Governments censor. Authority and power censors. Making a choice not to say something is not censorship. In any case, you are certainly not protected by the Constitution against the "censorship" of some guy not selling his RPG anymore. Seriously now.<br/><br/>I am not a lawyer. I am married to an ex-lawyer who specialized in copyright and computer law. I learned a fair bit from her. That doesn't mean I can't be wrong (of course). Please, if any of this stuff matters to you legally (i.e., your business depends on it), get a real lawyer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marco" title="Marco"><img alt="Marco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marco">Marco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172921/#Comment_172921" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T13:11:19+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  1:11PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In order to be treated seriously you have to act seriously. Internet threats are a great way to lose things like the benefit of the doubt. So is jumping in with straw-men "Let's ban Huck Finn"  (you could've said "I'd object to Twain banning Huck Finn. See how that could be bad!"--which would be fair for you to say, but has little visceral power, as you can see). <br/><br/>We can argue semantics about censorship (wikipedia defines it as "communicative material" and doesn't say anything about it being published) but you've got standards--they're yours--and you feel they're good. I've got mine: which has the benefit of the law backing them up--but hey. <br/><br/>Looking at your blog (or, at least, the one linked from your profile--maybe it's not yours) I can see that you:<br/>1. Have password protected posts. If someone just handed the password out would that be fine with you? I'm guessing not.<br/>2. Are writing a novel. What if someone distributes it for free on the Internet after it's published? I'll charitably assume that's fine with you--but would you apply that standard to everyone?<br/>3. Deleted information from MySpace. Should they have a right to just put it back up? Even if that's not in their terms of service? They should right?

Internet threats are a great way to lose things like the benefit of the doubt. So is jumping in with straw-men "Let's ban Huck Finn"</blockquote>I know it can be hard to tell when you're reading text and not seeing a person and hearing their voice, but I'll repeat once more: it was hyperbole.  I wasn't actually making a threat.  And how is <i>Huck Finn</i> a straw man?  It has been banned in the past.  Or at least people have attempted to do so.  Frequently.  I'm not actually sure if they've succeeded or not.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marco</cite>which has the benefit of the law backing them up--but hey.</blockquote>How so?  Write a book.  Publish it.  Sell it.  Then try to make everyone who ever bought a copy give it back to because you decided you don't like it anymore.  Copyright law doesn't give you that right.  It gives you the right to control who copies it and, to an extant, what they can do with that copy- but not to demand its return later, or to insist that they never read it again.<br/><br/>You seem confused not only about the general meaning of censorship, but even about my own specific meaning.  I thought I had explained it, but I'll assume I failed and will attempt to be more explicit as I address your points:<br/>1)Copyright and censorship are not directly related.  I password protect posts of fiction on my blog because I do not want to publish them.  This is not censorship, because the work has not been published.  As I said before, I would not consider it censorship if someone refused to allow me to read his personal journal.  It isn't a work that the public can access and hence, talking about in terms of "censorship" is nonsensical.<br/>2)Again, copyright and censorship are not directly related.  If/when I publish a novel, someone distributing it for free (whether on the Internet or otherwise) is an issue of copyright, not one of censorship, which is what I've been attempting to discuss with you.<br/>3)The MySpace point is more interesting.  My MySpace profile was never private, and neither were the blog posts I made there.  Thus, it could be argued that anything I posted there was "published."  No, they don't have the right to put it back up, because I own the copyright on those posts, but again, that really has nothing to do with censorship, so I'm not sure what your point was there.<br/><br/>I'll get really, really specific now.  Again.<br/>If you create something, you own the copyright to that something.  That gives you, at the most basic, the rights to control how it is reproduced and performed, or whether it is.  It doesn't give you ownership or control over copies that are legally sold.  If Mark Twain rose from the dead (and hadn't died so long ago his work was in the public domain) and said, "Oh my god, I never should have used racist words in <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>!  Everyone who owns a copy, you all need to give it back so I can destroy it, and all you libraries, you need to burn your copies as well." I'm pretty sure he'd be met with a resounding chorus of "No"s, especially from the librarians.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>okay, well this has been really fun, but i should probably try to channel my energy for this into getting caught up on my homework for my Intellectual Freedom and Libraries class.  i'm sure i'll be back later, and in the future i'll try to make my lack of rage more clear.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172934/#Comment_172934" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T13:37:07+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  1:37PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll vote for "speculative sales tactic predicated upon outdated assumptions about valuation of art objects", if it's all the same to you, Ben.

So far as I know, Twain never tried to ban his own stuff which is what I was talking about. <br/><br/><b>2. MySpace</b>: You say that censorship and copyright aren't related--but since you object to "self censorship" where an author invokes the protections of copyright to control the continued publication of his or her work, clearly you have a problem with internal logic. Matt ceasing sales of his games, while dramatic, is well within his rights--within his <i>copyright</i>, to be precise. The same way that MySpace shouldn't put up all your old post and personal information.<br/><br/>This seems like hypocrisy to me.<br/><br/><b>3. Getting the Books Back</b>. So far as I know no one is talking about anyone asking for all their books back. Not only is it unfeasible it seems more than a bit ridiculous. It's, you know, a <i>straw man</i>. If Twain said "I'm not publishing that book any more. It has my name on it and I do not stand behind it." That would be, I think, honorable and within his rights (even respectable--although Twain, of course, would recognize that it is in no way a racist book).<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172952/#Comment_172952" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T13:53:28+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  1:53PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>What do people here feel about limited edition art prints?<br/><br/>Horrible crime against humanity or legitimate artistic expression?</blockquote>\nI have long felt that limiting the availability of something diminishes its value.

It's editing, it's personal integrity, it's freedom of speech.<br/><br/>Removing your art from the public view is not unsaying anything. You can't unsay shit. You can only stop saying it.

Did someone knock on your door and demand you return a book? Or are you saying an author's rights to his books ends when they leave his pen? I don't think you are... but are you saying that, once the books are in the hands of the editor/publisher/distributor/bookstore/customer, the author has no rights anymore?

text and click <i>any</i> quote link, it quotes just that bit down here. Neat.<br/><br/>Let me add [numbers] after your points so I can discuss them without chopping your text to bits and destroying context.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>I'll get really, really specific now.  Again.<br/>If you create something, you own the copyright to that something.[1]  That gives you, at the most basic, the rights to control how it is reproduced and performed, or whether it is.  It doesn't give you ownership or control over copies that are legally sold.[2]  If Mark Twain rose from the dead (and hadn't died so long ago his work was in the public domain) and said, "Oh my god, I never should have used racist words in<i>Huckleberry Finn</i>!  Everyone who owns a copy, you all need to give it back so I can destroy it, and all you libraries, you need to burn your copies as well." I'm pretty sure he'd be met with a resounding chorus of "No"s, especially from the librarians.[3]</blockquote>\n[1] More or less. See what I said about moral copyright, creator's rights, and so on above. There are lots of situations in which you create something and someone else owns it: works for hire, derivative works, etc. <br/><br/>[2] Not the physical copies, no, but it does protect the content on those copies and since content you own is on those physical copies, that means you have some rights governing how a person uses the physical copy. They, for example, can copy their physical copy only in specific ways. They cannot translate it into another medium in many cases. They cannot claim the work on it is their own work. In the case of music, they can't play it for an audience, in many cases.<br/><br/>[3] This is a scarecrow doused in gasoline and torched with a flamethrower.

What are your values regarding money? What are you definitions of art? And how do you see those answers affecting your opinion of IP?<br/>I gave up a lucrative career as a graphic designer in the pharmaceutical and medical communications industries to concentrate on my music and art. I make a living teaching guitar lessons, but I've limited the amount of time I'll work on non-creative things. I make a quarter of my former income, and have made tons of material sacrifices so that my wife and I can pursue our creative interests without having to work day jobs.<br/><br/>I don't create art because I want to. If I don't make something every day, I get depressed and go into an existential crisis. Sometimes this depression causes people to quit their extremely impressive jobs (see above).<br/><br/>Defining Art is tricky, but I'll take a stab at it. It's a very subjective definition and I make no claims that it is the only definition. Art is a product of a creative journey that has somehow changed the producer, in addition it communicates to the participant (viewer, listener, reader, et cetera) and may transform him as well. Certain story games have transformed me in major ways. I am a better person and more competent artist because of them.<br/><br/>I grew up in a small town and I'm from a poor family. We just couldn't afford all the books I wanted to read. Luckily we have some really good librarians. I somehow managed to learn a lot and develop a curiosity about the world, art, philosophy, and literature because of the contents of the Lewis Cooper Jr. Public Library. I've been to small towns with shitty collections and lazy librarians. I'm thankful that I grew up where I did.<br/><br/>I had a neighbor with about five feet of obscure jazz albums. He'd let me borrow a couple at a time to take home and copy onto cassette. My love of jazz and blues is largely due to his influence and his allowing me to illegally copy his albums. Still, a good bookstore or record store was about a two-hour drive away, and I might be able to afford something if I really saved.<br/><br/>This was before the internet. Now that we have the internet, there is no excuse for kids to not have access to culture.<br/><br/>I guess a lot of my emotional responses are a result of being mentored by amazing jazz musicians who are generous as a culture. The music is more important than you are. You don't get into jazz to make money. The man whom I consider to be one of the greatest jazz guitarists to ever live lives in Section-8 housing in a really bad Philly neighborhood. It's a sacrifice he is willing to make for his art. He gives away his CDs like Mardi Gras beads.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173130/#Comment_173130" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-04T01:40:08+00:00" title="October  4, 2008  1:40AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you can't afford the lawyers to pursue a case, copyright is irrelevant.<br/><br/>Digital media and distribution has made copyright unenforceable anyway.<br/><br/>Copyright is not a right in any sense of the word. It's a law embodying a principle of Capitalism, the purpose of which is to turn Art into a consumable Product.<br/><br/>Copyright laws have allowed both the music industry and Hollywood to monopolize those arts (in fact redefine them) in ways beneficial primarily to them, allowing only a few companies and individuals to dictate not only who becomes successful, but also the basic choices available (conceivable) to the rest of us.<br/><br/>Digital media, however, has irrevocably set in motion the destruction of these media hegemonies by decentralizing the production, distribution, and consumption of these products.<br/><br/>People do not pay (indeed have never paid) for content. They pay for the distribution channel, whether it's handwritten parchment scrolls or pdfs. That's why the 99 cent principle of iTunes is so important to its success.<br/><br/>Some works - such as fonts - are explicitly excluded from copyright law - yet there are still font designers that do quite well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173254/#Comment_173254" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-04T14:06:42+00:00" title="October  4, 2008  2:06PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, I think you're wrong about a lot of stuff. Copyright is a right -- a moral right. Forget the money for a minute. Copyright protects how your work is used by others and it protects attribution, which is very important to a lot of people who still give their product away for free. I imagine that if people started claiming that they had written The Shadow of Yesterday, Clinton would get pretty pissed. But they're free to take the licensed version of it and create new stuff out of it (if they give him credit), as Eero has done with Solar System.<br/><br/>Yes, part of copyright law is about the right to profit. That's how copyright law started some 500 years ago or whatever, and it was pretty much all about that up till the 1800's before the thinking caught up with the technology. Before printing presses were widespread, it wasn't really practical to claim another's work as yours (there was only one copy of it, and the monks could make another but they generally copied it faithfully and everyone knew you wrote it). You didn't need copyright law that much then. Authors couldn't profit on books anyway. Then movable type changed the world. People started cranking out copies of things and created a new market. Publishers needed profit protection and got copyright laws in place to stop piracy. Authors then made almost nothing (not much different than today, but it's a lot better, especially in creator-owned arenas, eh?). <br/><br/>Once thought caught up with technology, people believed that it wasn't just the money. That the integrity of a fixed expression of art or thought was something worth protecting. The money aspect was still there, but there was more. The Berne Convention solidified many of those ideas and a lot of nations signed into agreement to uphold a minimum set of creator's rights. The strictest moral copyright laws oversees make it impossible to give up one's ownership of art accidentally. No work-for-hire contract will steal it away. You have to work pretty hard to transfer rights to a company, for example. Not so in the U.S., but our laws still protect corporate interests better than personal interests, unfortunately. The laws aren't bad, though; just murky as hell.<br/><br/>I'm not saying you are wrong about how Hollywood and Motown and all of their brethren have made a mockery of copyright. You don't have to tell an indie game designer like me that we don't need The Man to publish our shit. <br/><br/>I disagree that copyright is unenforceable. Yeah, you generally need a lawyer, but there's a law and you can seek remedy. People do this all the time. Often, things get settled out of court before it gets nasty. Often, a cease and desist letter is enough to fix things. If you're just saying that Internet decentralization tools like Bit Torrent (often hosted overseas, too) make it really hard to stop piracy, yeah, that's right. Sure. Folks have talked about that kind of thing before, here and on the Forge. People were losing sales because of it, so they contacted some of the sites and asked them to replace the PDF they were distributing with a different one (I think it was a free quickstart version instead) and a lot of them happily complied. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, I'm left a little confused by what you're implying. Are you saying that indie publishers should just not publish anything if they expect to be fairly compensated? Do you really want to limit the "market" to only those designers who are willing to publish for free? I can tell you right now, you wouldn't have a Sorcerer, or a Dogs in the Vineyard, or a Mountain Witch if there were no profit incentive for publishing. <br/><br/>Information should be free and all that shit, but my hard, creative work isn't "information." It's art. No, all the creative shit that goes from my brain to a well-written, playtested, illustrated form should not be free unless I want to subsidize it for the world. Maybe I do subsidize your fun sometimes. Hell, I pay about $90/month to host a unix server so that I can run a text-based MMO for a few hundred players; I've worked on this game for about 12 years and I have never charged a penny. I understand giving away creative work. But that's my choice. <br/><br/>If I decide to charge for my work and people take that work and give copies away for free on Bit Torrent (or even photocopy it and hand it out at conventions without my permission), they're stealing potential sales from me. Yes, I realize there are theories that say that those things increase my sales, but it's not your choice to make. It's mine because it's my stuff. I choose how to market it.<br/><br/>Realize that for an indie game I write, I am part of the distribution channel. You say people pay for that. I want my cut of that distribution then. But, really, people want to pay for my content, if anything, because they get value out of reading and play the actual game (a repeatable thing), not the getting of the game (a one-time thing).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173256/#Comment_173256" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-04T14:10:58+00:00" title="October  4, 2008  2:10PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm gonna bow out of this discussion, and all discussions about copyright and intellectual property on Story Games, because it's not about gaming.

They are not inalienable. This is why the USSR was able to be communist. I find the people yammering "political" very amusing, because yeah it is, does it surprise you? When a bunch of elected yahoos can determine who makes money and who doesn't off of ideas, your surprised that ideas becomes political? That these Property rights are changed for certain people or with enough lobbying. enough people with enough money like the OP will make it the law, and i would very much like to see where all these moral and legal arguments go. <br>\n<br>\nBut hey, Here's what i am going to do. <br>\n<br>\nIf i Can't Buy the book, I'll download it.

They are bad laws, and while you may disaggree with me and say 'you can't just ignore laws you dont like' I'm pretty sure that to the extent  I can that I will, and that this is the way things are supposed to be. This is how legal change happens (its kinda like evolution). <br/>\n<br/>\nTo those of you are going to call me a thief and an immoral person, I really don't believe morality applies to property 'rights' so much as property itself. Me stealing a car or a book, IS different from me infringing intellectual property (actual loss vs potential loss). If it makes you feel any better , I would steal cars to, if in someway i could leave the original car behind. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes this is all political, perhaps the moralist should be the ones shouting that at themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nL                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173329/#Comment_173329" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-05T10:54:03+00:00" title="October  5, 2008 10:54AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>I'm sorry it came across as snark.
