It didn't win, but I was sufficiently fired up about it to tidy it up (the original submission was riddled with typos and omissions), and I'm reasonably happy with it now, so I'm opening it up to playtesters. If you're interested in giving it a spin, please let me know.<br/><br/>On another forum, a couple of folks asked me for a pitch, and I thought I\u2019d post that here too, so:<br/><br/><b>Elevator Pitch</b><br/><br/>Your perfect Society has lost its Rulebook. Never mind, sit down and write another one. But be quick about it, because chaos and anarchy are just around the corner...........<br/><br/>In <i>All That Glitters</i>, players take on the roles of Elders, High Councillors, High Priests, merchants and ordinary citizens, as they attempt to rebuild the City of Ozgurdia almost literally from the ground up, amid a gradual breakdown of the order that has existed for centuries, and a consequent descent into lawlessness and savagery. Players play several different roles throughout the game, which allows for a rich and varied roleplaying experience. <br/><br/><b>Game structure</b><br/><br/>In <b>Phase 1</b> you play elders meeting in the immediate aftermath of the death of <i>the Book</i>, a quasi-organic sacred text containing rules for every aspect of life in Ozgurdia, from the sublime to (what we would probably think of as) the ridiculous, forex what colour of apple may be sold on which day of the week. The atmosphere in this phase is one of claustrophobia, panic, and creeping horror, with the  characters desperately seeking a way out of the crisis, throwing out suggestions for panic measures, trying to hold onto their (and their colleagues\u2019) sanity, and either putting their heads in their hands and wailing, or blaming the situation on each other. <br/><br/>In <b>Phase 2</b>, some semblance of formal Government has been established, and you play the new leaders as they attempt to keep a lid on the anarchy by reacting to specific events, i.e. firefighting essentially.<br/><br/>Next, there is an interval during which the players flesh out Ozgurdia, with descriptions of the city and its environs, flora and fauna, tech level, citizens\u2019 allegiances (guilds, powerful families etc.) and so forth. <br/><br/>In <b>Phase 3</b>, order has begun to be restored, and a charismatic leader has emerged, who will be either a despotic tyrant or an enlightened and benevolent leader according the outcome of  Phase 2. You play alternately the Leader and High Council- who strive to develop a set of laws more complex and detailed than those of Phase 2- and Tribune and ordinary citizens- who react to these laws, showing how they will either improve the situation or in fact exacerbate it. <br/><br/>It\u2019s in this Phase that the bulk of the roleplaying will take place, with the player group deciding whether they want either a shortish game, in which case they merely sketch out their citizen characters (who are built using a combo of three stats), or a longer one, in which case they roleplay not only their reactions to the new laws, but their roles and relationships in the Society as well, the default setting being that of a surreal, semi-fantastical one after the style of the worlds created by authors such as Jack Vance, Ursula le Guin and Michael Moorcock. Theoretically, this section can continue for as long as the players are enjoying, or feel that they're getting mileage out of it.<br/><br/>In the <b>Epilogue</b>, we look at Ozgurdia a few years on, and, according, to how successful the characters were in the earlier Phases of re-building the Society, it will either have been fully restored to its former Utopian glory, or will have slid irrevocably into post-apocalyptic, Mad Max-style anarchy.  <br/><br/>Finally, over the next number of weeks I'm going to post calls for playtesters for several of my games, and I'd like to apologise in advance for doing so much pimping of my stuff and not return making a significant contribution to the threads on these forums. I think that sort thing is an occupationsal hazard for a game dessigner, but I'm aware that it's kind of bad form, and so I'm trying to develop a time management plan that will enable me to do the right amount of both. Please bear with me while I work on this.......                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436715/#Comment_436715" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-08T11:21:29+00:00" title="August  8, 2014 11:21AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2014 11:28AM by catty_big.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just a quickie. In his review, one of the Game Chef peer reviewers made this comment:\n<blockquote>The setting intro made me think at first that the game was going to be more serious and insightful, so I kinda felt let down at each paragraph until I read the list of events. Then I realized that the atmosphere was more like weird/chaotic/ridiculous fun</blockquote>\nThe answer I gave (I'm aware it's not a definitive answer, hence my posting about it here- I'd like to see what other folks think), was as follows:\n<blockquote>My concept for Ozgurdia is that of a city with a bunch of what would seem to us to be bizarre rules, but which are ones that that society takes very seriously. So, while there is obviously a lot of fun to be had from making up absurd situations like market traders not being allowed to sell red apples on a Tuesday, in the game world it\u2019s all deadly serious, since it\u2019s the kind of society where every single aspect of life was ordained by the Book. In other words it\u2019s both serious and silly at the same time, if that makes sense.<blockquote></blockquote></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436718/#Comment_436718" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-08T13:41:05+00:00" title="August  8, 2014  1:41PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How many players and how long does it take to play?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436720/#Comment_436720" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-08T13:55:01+00:00" title="August  8, 2014  1:55PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2014 1:55PM by catty_big.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't yet playtested it but, given that there's very little in the way of set-up (the longest will be the maps and details about the city in the interval between Phases II and II), I estimate it will play out in well under 3 hrs. It's designed to be played with as few as three people, but I think the more the merrier, as a lot of the game involves characters with various agendas arguing and debating with each other. However, the game is in a very raw state, so pretty much every aspect of it is up for grabs, and all feedback is welcome, and could translate into a mention in the acknowledgements <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436721/#Comment_436721" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-08T13:55:52+00:00" title="August  8, 2014  1:55PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2014 1:56PM by Paul_T.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks!
