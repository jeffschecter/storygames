For those who aren't familiar with convention games, a blurb is a brief description of the game that's intend to draw people to the game and inform them on what the game is about in 3 or 4 sentences.<br/><br/>The blurb also requires a game system name and a scenario title and while I think that "A Penny For My Thoughts" should suffice for both, I know that's going to confuse the con coordinator. So I'm thinking about calling the system "Story Game" or naming the scenario "Telepathic Therapy" (listing Paul as the scenario author since I'm not writing anything). <br/><br/>How have others dealt with this for self-contained games like APFMT where the system is the scenario? I'm think Polaris, Gingerbread Men, and a few others would have faced the same questions in the past based on what little I know of those games.<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105148/#Comment_105148" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-27T13:53:11+00:00" title="October 27, 2007  1:53PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 27, 2007 1:54PM by Graham.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Usually, I think up a fairly generic and grabby title. Like, for Lacuna, I think it was "Do No Harm" (which actually is not that great, but you get the picture). For Best Friends, I used "The Mystery Of Blackstock Ridge": the only set part of the scenario was that they were on holiday in a cabin in Blackstock Ridge, whatever that was.<br/><br/>I like your "Telepathic Therapy". Better than calling the system "Story Game", in my opinion.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105179/#Comment_105179" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-27T23:05:13+00:00" title="October 27, 2007 11:05PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd use <i>A Penny For My Thoughts</i> for the system, cuz, well, that is the system.

Sure, you'll scare off some of the traditional gamers, but you'll guarantee that those who show up to play won't be bringing "dungeon crawl, but inside someone's brain" baggage. (Not that there's anything wrong with that!) You shouldn't have to do this, but if the mechanics are a good distance away from "roll a d20," then you owe the potential players that forewarning. Some folks have a real hate-on for dice pools, or roll-low, or whatever, and would let that negative vibe spoil the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105201/#Comment_105201" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-28T09:17:45+00:00" title="October 28, 2007  9:17AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd also make sure that you mention in the program blurb that it's a playtest.<br/><br/>Drop me a line and I'll hook you up with the latest version of the rules.

So the blurb with a "playtest" warning should take care of it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ptevis</cite>I'd also make sure that you mention in the program blurb that it's a playtest.<br/><br/>Drop me a line and I'll hook you up with the latest version of the rules.

The con's in February so I'll hit you up in January for the latest version...unless it's done now?<br/><br/>Newish Topic: I was planning on GMing the game taking on the role of the doctor and reading/paraphrasing the rules for the players and generally keeping them on track. With a group that has very little story games experience, is this a good idea or will it work just fine if I'm a patient too?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
