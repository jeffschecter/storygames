In fact, overall, it feels like there's little to no story/indie type games being played in California north of the Los Angeles cons (and, to be sure, I'm talking only about game conventions here, not folks' home games of course).  For instance, I ran some SotC at Polycon down in SLO last summer and people were coming up to me like apes to the monolith.  Mix it up, people... try other stuff.

While our MiniCons have gone gangbusters, I have intentionally cut them back from four to three this year. One of which will be co-sponsored by the Good Omens gaming group. By the end of last year, we were not only seeing less people offering to run games, several that were went back to more traditional type games. I also saw less player, and many committing to play only at the last minute.<br/><br/>Why? I dunno. I could make some wild ass guesses. One possibly being that there was no "new hotness" toward the end of the year. We were seeing a lot of traction with titles in the SG community I would consider almost Evergreen (already), like SoC and Dogs...The second could be the amount of events happening in the area. If you look on the IPR retailer locator, we are one of five stores in California, with each one being within a 60(?) mile radius. EndGame along with Black Diamond run Minicons several times a year now. So, are we scratching that itch for Story Games that venues such as DDC are struggling to? I have been told on several occasions we are.We also make it really easy to show up for a four hour session, play, and get out of Dodge. That lack of structure really seems to appeal to this community <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> (Damn Hippys!) Now, DDC will claim up and down they post what people submit, and when they run out of room, they stop accepting submissions. So, for number three, I might suggest that there aren't many SGs on the calendar because folks didn't step up to the plate fast enough. They are seriously impacted for space, have been for years, and have no desire to change any of it. So...for 2009, you wanna play there, jump in early and often and the disparity might start to shrink.<br/><br/>yay!<br/><br/>Ch<br/>EndGame                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wirebrain" title="Wirebrain"><img alt="Wirebrain" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wirebrain">Wirebrain</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124143/#Comment_124143" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-03T11:03:54+00:00" title="February  3, 2008 11:03AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite>DunDraCon is ripe for colonization.

There was absolutely no problem with the Convention (Conquest SF) proving space for the story games lounge at all. The Con gave us dedicated space for 4 days and pretty much a free hand in scheduling and using it. The Con was extremely supportive of the effort - best I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The problem, frankly, was that no one stepped up to run a game other than myself and Paul Strack (aka Dr. Mysterio). Local favorites Caesar X and Carl Rigney were excused, having long scheduled trips out of country.<br/><br/>My posts looking for GMs and publishers here at S-G were entirely ignored. Here, I didn't get a single response. Not one. A few Bay Area based lists generated some small discussion, but no real takers. Such is life. <br/><br/>I won't be making another attempt. I already provide plenty of advocacy running sell out SOTC and other s-g games at the EG minicons not to mention via podcast (2d6 Feet in a Random Direction). I'm happy to see others "colonize" as they'd like (and good luck) but you'll have to forgive me for getting completely turned off by the experience. It was very demoralizing - especially as other requests for help for the very same topic at other cons generated more enthusiastic response here during the same timeframe.<br/><br/>As for DDC - yes, I understand that there's little s-g presence because they received few s-g games submissions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128777/#Comment_128777" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T14:37:47+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  2:37PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to randomly follow up here, Ken Hite reports on the 2d6 Feet in a Random Direction podcast that, in the final con program, there was "more FATE than there was GURPS, and as much Dogs in the Vineyard as there was Vampire."

In fact we were wiped out of most of our titles. It was a very interesting DDC for us that way. The past two cons (Kublacon and Conquest) were absolutely flat for Story Game sales. Barely even a dent in our overall sales total. DDC proved to be a very different story. And this is even with two other dealers stocking titles (No clue how they did. They certainly don't do a very good job merchandising their con stock) Thankfully I carry some titles deep as is, so we didn't miss too many sales.<br/><br/>Interesting stuff.<br/><br/>Ch<br/>-EndGame                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129600/#Comment_129600" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T23:59:12+00:00" title="February 22, 2008 11:59PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Games of Berkeley had their indie games in tubs so you had to flip through looking at them; I much preferred Endgame's method of having them either face out or at least spine out so you could scan efficiently.<br/><br/>I must have missed the third vendor carrying indie games; I blame all the sparkly chessex dice for distracting me (hey, I needed more D10s for <em>Monsters and Other Childish Things</em>).<br/><br/>Maybe players will ask DDC for more indie games and they'll start scheduling more.<br/><br/>And hey, I was totally willing to run Don't Rest Your Head but Chaos Librarians kidnapped everyone instead.
