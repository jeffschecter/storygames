Oliver, the Weapons Officer, was able to save Kerra (Medical) from a bunch of malfunctioning drones, which kept trying to kill her. She, as the Medical Officer, refused to cure the xenovirus (which was causing all these hideous lesions to develop over his skin) until he eliminated the last drone.<br/><br/>Engineering (played by Kyle), on the other hand, nearly got trapped in a temporal loop, which kept causing him to start over from the very first scene before deja vu kicked in. Eventually, he was able to reach the ship's Quantum Core and shield us all from the chronofractic waves.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for me, Weapons was smart enough to check the holocrystal logs, and discovered that my character, the Bridge Officer, was a murderous traitor. After he finished cursing me out, I tried to explain that it was a mercy killing -- I was trying to spare them agonizing pain by having the drones just hunt them down and kill them quickly. They didn't forgive me.<br/><br/>They tried to leave me behind, but I was able to make it to a shuttle and get clear of the ship as they all ejected from the ship in escape pods. Then the temporal field crushed our starship into scrap metal.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389089/#Comment_389089" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-03T07:38:46+00:00" title="September  3, 2012  7:38AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's the YouTube video containing the audio (the first 15 minutes, anyhow).<br/><br/>Next time, I'll do video as well, probably.<br/><br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-OdeF-scs2iM?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdeF-scs2iM"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/OdeF-scs2iM/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
