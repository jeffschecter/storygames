                    The leaves are changing color and the shadow of the monolith that is Gen Con is fading.<br/><br/>Fall gaming.<br/><br/>The Friday night group has stepped up in a big way with PTA.  We are playing this glorious post-apoc group set in the NYC public library called Lions at the Gate, a reference to the two lions outside that building.  I am psyched that everyone is set and ready to play through an entire season, at the very least.<br/><br/>After that we are talking about maybe another player running Dictionary of Mu, which would be a hoot for me to play.  I want to play a talking ape version of Conan.<br/><br/>After that I want me some Friday night BE and want it bad.<br/><br/>The Sunday group is still figuring out what to do.  The Cold City game was postponed due to some family stuff that made it impossible for me to game for a while.  Now we're still figuring out what to play, with every player in the group offering up really interesting shit.  Mutants and Masterminds, Cold City, Don't Rest Your Head, Spirit of the Century...fun options.<br/><br/>The monthly 1st Quest group has had some serious stall with that game due to constant scheduling conflicts but dat's life.<br/><br/>How's about you?                </div>

                            StoryGames Boston is officially launching this coming Wednesday, but we've already played 1001 Nights, Dust Devils and The Shadow of Yesterday. It's exactly what I'm in the mood for right now, a rotating appetizer platter of gaming. I hope that once we see what kind of attendance and interest we have, we'll be able to keep playing some of the games we've already started.<br/><br/>My Burning Wheel game is starting to heat up. We're having trouble establishing a weekly time slot, but we've gotten through three sessions so far and now that the semesters started and con season is over, we hope to be able to make a weekly or at least bi-weekly schedule.<br/><br/>I hope that I'll be able to attend JiffyCon 2, whenever that happens, and there's a chance I'll be able to make it out to Southern Exposure. So whatever happens then, happens then.<br/><br/>I'm running a playtest of my play-by-email game Countdown*, which is getting off the ground as we speak. The characters are AWESOME, and I'm really excited. There will be logs of that soon enough.<br/><br/>I would be open to one more scheduled game, maybe on a monthly schedule, of something, but I'm not really pushing for it. I'm waiting to see how SGBoston pans out.<br/><br/>*title very, very subject to change.                        </div>

                            SG Boston has our first official meeting next week.  I'm gonna write up an <i>Agon</i> adventure and hopefully run some people through it.<br/><br/>In our previous pre-game meetings, I got to play <i>1001 Nights</i> for the first time (which was awesome), Dev ran a mix of the old and new <i>Dust Devils</i> rules (which was fun, but felt more like a playtest), and then I ran a crazy pirate version of <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> (which I need to write an Actual Play report of sometime).  So far, it looks like we're gonna run a new game every week for a while, partially to catch up on all the new games we picked up at GenCon.  That'll be completely awesome (I can't wait for <i>Roach</i> night!), but I'm already thinking about running something a bit longer, like maybe a 3-session story arc of <i>TSoY</i>, <i>Nobilis</i>, or <i>Nine Worlds</i>.  I've never played <i>Nine Worlds</i>, so I think I'd want to run a one-shot first and then continue it if people were really into it.<br/><br/>We've been going out for beers and/or food after each weekly session, and it's been awesome to really get to know Dev, Nathan, and Katie (the current SGB members) and chat about games with them.  I'm super stoked.                        </div>

                            I'm running Hero's Banner right now, and ran Blue Rose last weekend (which was awesome.)<br/><br/>I just saw The Protector (a movie) last night, and holy crap, was it awesome. It gave me an idea for a campaign I want to run locally. I want to run <a href="http://www.pigames.net/store/default.php?cPath=40" rel="nofollow">Iron Gauntlets</a>, with this setup: there will be a story, and it will be pretty much scripted, but your actions within it each week will influence the prep for next week, and there will be explicitly scripted-in fight scenes. So, a script with places for giant throwdowns, complete with a set (a battle map) and a tactile component (paper miniatures). It is a testament to how far my head is up the ass of indie games that I just described, basically, D&amp;D, and thought it was innovative. You guys probably know what I mean, though: strip away the pretext and say, "we're making a fantasy action movie!"                        </div>

                            Above-mentioned Hero's Banner, after which I'm slotted to run some Cold City, although that may change if I can't convince Clinton and Remi that shooting zombies in the face is a good use of their time.  <br/><br/>My regular Wednesday group is ending our insano China TSOY game this week and then it's more TSOY, this time set during the Klondike gold rush.  After that we'll probably play some TSOY or something.<br/><br/>I'm running a hot mess at MACE con, and probably also at Camp Nerdly 0.                        </div>

                            Ooh I'm a big fan of Iron Gauntlets, but have never run it. Let us know how it goes (actual play perhaps?). <br/><br/>My thursday night Etherscope game, the League of Expendable Gentlemen, has just started up again after a month long hiatus.<br/><br/>My wednesday night WFRP game is on hold whilst the GM is on his holiday, giving me the opportunity to run a one-shot of Burning Empires last week (one week after I got my copy - is that some sort of record? it sure is for me!). This week I think we're playing Red Star using the Savage Worlds system.<br/><br/>And then next week I'm hopefully starting a proper Burning Empires campaign via skype!                        </div>

                            Well, Judd, these are exciting days for Andy in GamingLand. Here's what's up:<br/><br/>-1) The work on Tenra Bansho Zero is coming to a critical stage. The translations are to be completed this month. Then the REAL work begins on shuffling them all into the game. Coming up with new rules and new game advice. Getting Microfiction and Other Related Writing written for the thing so that it's understandable/playable for non-Japanese.A dn playtesting the fuck out of it in record time to make sure it all does what it says it does. Then layout begins at the end of Fall / early Winter. <br/><br/>0) The new dining room table, aka the new gaming table, arrives next week from Furnitureland South. This is the most significant purchase we've made since we moved into the new house last year, and it was motivated equally by Gaming as by Eating. It is a thing of beauty, and there will be pictures.<br/><br/>1) My bi-weekly experimental gaming group (read: Mostly indie games) is starting the first "actual full-on gaming session" of Burning Wheel next week (though we did play about 15 minutes last session). We are all lords of a thieves' guild of Lankhmar, and the opening scene was "You are in the Guildmaster's quarters. The Guildmaster lays dead at your feet. And now someone is knocking at the door behind you." This will be a 5 session game, each session protraying one full day (night) in succession. Like 24, but with a day per session.<br/><br/>After this, the jury's out on what's next. Probably Tenra Bansho, as we see what works and what needs work.<br/><br/>2) Upcoming Events: NC Gameday in September (Sat), where I plan to bring TBZ but will first see what else is being run. Then Camp Nerdly in October, and finally MACE in November, where I'll be running TBZ at both. Inside there is also helping judge the MACE Game Chef competition, which is pretty much like baby Game Chef; easy, light and fun.<br/><br/>3) My weekly 'more traditional' group will finish up our current Time Cop PTA game in 3 weeks. Then we will decide what to do next.  This is really exciting because:<br/><br/>A) Folks (me too) are interested in trying something more crunchy/tactical for a while. So we're gonna have to decide on a ruleset. Much of me is leaning towards D&amp;D 3.0, as it's tactical, but not quite "requires minis". We would do Burning Wheel or Riddle of Steel, but we want a system where it's not too much of a learning curve (as one of the players is very much the "social gamer", and while she is a supergenius at psychology, Java development and research, for some reason game rules just never stick for her), and also ALL of us have experience with good ol d20. <br/><br/>There was some interest in using HeroQuest rules, but I think too much of the rulebook is tied to Glorantha to be of much use to us. I'm kinda eyeing for when Mythic Russia will be out, to see if it scratches the itch of "HeroQuest, but a little distanced from Glorantha".<br/><br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> Mark, the usual quiet one of the group, told me that he's thinking that he wants to try running something. Out of the blue.  This made me flip out, because it shows me that he's really excited about gaming, and because I'm the de facto GM:<br/><br/>Jeremie is concerned that his English isn't good enough to run a good adventure. Which isn't really true, but enough of a concern of his that he's afraid. But he's awesome and theatrical as a player.<br/>Beth is the social gamer: She expressed interest in running something at some time, but she's really busy with job, child, and other distractions. But Alan and I have encouraged her to think about it, and she isn't completely opposed.<br/>Alan is the Other GM, but tends to do the whole trad roleplaying thing (Roll behind the screen; When we fail our dice roll, but it Needs to Happen (ie Finding The Clue) we do anyways; there's 'one solution' to 'the problem'; etc) which sometimes the others get bothered with. I'd love him to run again as I'm kinda tired these days, but he's busy as hell with his new job, coding on the side, and leaving the country every other month on business/SVG conference trips.<br/>And Me.<br/><br/>So right now Mark and I are thinking that we go to something like d20, FATE, Storyteller, HeroQuest or whatever and have everyone get "the book" to get familiar with the game. From that point, I'll GM a small "story arc" or something in the setting we choose (we may come up with our own again for player buy-in). Then after a few sessions I'll turn it over to Mark for the next part and help him out (as it's the first time he'd ever be GM-ing).<br/><br/>Anyway, that was really fucking exciting, to have someone else in my group who had never GMed before step up and want to give it a shot. I want to be careful with choice of system and all to make sure we're all satisfied and that it goes well for him.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Andy,<br/><br/>Seriously, if you want something crunchy, with tactical flair, but not hard to learn, and cheap (since everyone's getting it), check out Iron Gauntlets. I'm pushing it hard lately, but I just really started noticing it, and it's quite tight. The super-bonus is this: the main book comes with a bunch of full-page set pieces (read, combat scene/battlemats) and some cut-out paper miniatures. You can get more miniatures cheaply from their site. This is the most exciting thing in a while in RPGs for me.                        </div>

                            Man, gaming is awesome this year. <br/>
<br/>
1) My regular Tuesday night group is running a game of The Anti-Pool in "The Haunting of Alaizabelle Cray" universe, with the second session in a couple of days.<br/>
<br/>
2) I'm playing in The Mountain Witch with a bunch of fresh-to-indie-games players, who are loving it. We've got the final 'things fall apart' session to go, probably this Thursday.<br/>
<br/>
3) Yesterday, a bunch of us hard SF / hardcore gaming geeks got together and prepped our new Burning Empires game. It was a frakkin' marathon &amp; most of us were wiped by the end of it, but the idea of playing bastards, revolutionaries and military dictators in the middle of an ecological and economic collapse (before the Vaylen even arrive) has got me pretty excited.<br/>
<br/>
And in early October, we've got Mega Roleplaying Weekend, our two-house con, where hopefully I'll get to run The Princes' Kingdom &amp; kick off Season 2 of "Phoenix", our PTA game.<br/>
<br/>
Clinton, I'll go and check out Iron Gauntlets now.                        </div>

You sure that's not Arrowflight you're thinking about? That's old school fantasy with a 2d6 mechanic that PIG do some support for. Arrowflight is also excellent, there's a new edition coming out soon too, which has me all giddy!<br/><br/>Iron Gauntlets has some great support - I had the privilege of editing the new Iron Gauntlets setting, Steampunk Musha (steampunk, japan style) and it rocks even more than the core IG book!                        </div>

                            To me it looks like:<br/><br/>1) Continuing campaign in Fading Suns universe with Over The Edge rules. I'm running this as an experiment of reactionary gamemastering (whereas I usually have a habit of pre-planning). The players do what they feel their characters do, I'll react, only occasionally throwing in something new.<br/><br/>2) I should really do a LARP. It's a big job, but I have this idea of relatively small LARP with modern time - flashback - modern time, with ritualistic scene changes.<br/><br/>3) Pendagron and the Great Pendagron Campaign draw me in. I'm figuring that I could draw together folks that haven't been able to game in a while or with whom I haven't been able game with in a while, because Pendagron feels like a thing that could run itself.<br/><br/>4) Or I might want to test out Dogs in The Vineyard or Mountain Witch and see if they really work with us immersive hippies.                        </div>

                            I've only recently started gaming regularly again, and I'm between games right now. Both my weekday group (usually Mondays) and my weekend group finished The Mountain Witch. I think it will be Dogs in the Vineyard next for the weekday group, and I'm about to start negotiating on game with the weekend group. Also, I've just started to hook up with some of the awesome local gamers represented on this forum, so I expect more action there, hopefully as a player.                        </div>

                            This fall, I'm playing in our Friday night game-- at the moment, it's our Dragon's Talons game.  We're enjoying the heck out of it.  At the end of the arc, we might switch back to our Star Wars game (the old WEG one), or we might pick something new.  I'm still jazzed about D&amp;D-- after burning out last campaign, I'm pleased at how well it's holding up this time.  Character simplicity has really paid off.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I'm currently recruiting for <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1281" rel="nofollow">a PTA game</a> to play on Thursdays (opposite Jennifer's magic class); our pitch session is this Thursday, if enough people respond.</span> Updated sad note that I didn't want to polute the thread with. There was one person, in a town of 450,000+ who replied with interest to PTA, at all, even just a pitch session to try it.  He said he had the same experience when he proposed Darwin's World.<br/><br/>While it's not roleplaying, we play board games on Wednesday pretty consistantly.  The mix is different from the Friday RPG group, but there's good overlap.  Emily from this group might fit PTA pretty well... reminder to self. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>  As long as I'm updating, board gaming has been a little week due to school, so it's moving to Monday night.                        </div>

                            Let's see:<br/><br/>In the past week I've played:<br/>Burning THAC0 (a Burning Wheel game that has been using the old B-Series of D&amp;D modules as its basis). This is an alternate for my normal Tuesday night game. We run this one when one of our crew, Andy Action, is off touring with his band. This game and the regular Burning Wheel game will continue into the fall.<br/><br/>Shock: We finished our <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21267.0" rel="nofollow">exploration of the Global Distributed MindNet</a>. Very cool stuff! We'll be moving on from here. This group has a number of games on its plate, including Rune, Agon, Sorcerer and more. Not sure which one we'll be going with next just yet.<br/><br/>Lacuna, 2nd attempt. Agent Barber made yet another dive, this time with a team of rookies. It still rocks!<br/><br/>Nine Worlds. We had the first session of play of our Nine Worlds campaign. We fought a hydra and then had a run-in with Autodichos, an Atlantean in the service of Kronos. Really great. I'm looking forward to seeing where this game goes. Alexander will hopefully post an AP soon. We'll be playing more of this one!<br/><br/>Burning Ya-Gahn. Our Burning Wheel game inspired by the dark ages of Earthsea. While looking for herbs to heal a wounded companion, we landed upon an isle that had been cursed with a horrible wasting disease by the evil Ders-Guhl, a wizard in the service of the pirate lord  Sahklyn the Red. Continues to be excellent.                        </div>

                            I'm bowing out of an Exalted game, but finishing up being a player (!) in a Don't Rest Your Head game (the one Diesel Remmick came from). It's awesome; we've ended up at the island resort that people go to when vacationing from the Mad City, dealing with a face-stealing casino boss who's stolen the face of the son I never knew I had.<br/><br/>I broke the bank by using my guitar skills.<br/><br/>Am also revving up to run a Dictionary of Mu game.  If I'm lucky, I'll thrash it hardcore.                        </div>

                            Three regular groups:<br/>
<br/>
1. Sorcerer via IRC. This is my first time playing Sorcerer. For some reason, Sorcerer is not getting a whole lot of love in Danish gaming circles - even the crowd interested in indie-games have more or less shunned it. The GM, Per (pfischer here on the site), is trying to remedy that. The campaign takes place in Berlin in the 80's. My character's a no-good punk artiste with a tatoo demon. Two session under out belt so far and it's really beginning to come together. I guess I need a few more sessions to gauge my opinion of Sorcerer.<br/>
<br/>
2. A group of gamers new to indie-games (apart from myself). We've played In a Wicked Age with great succes. Next up is My Life with Master and I'm hoping to play some Hero's Banner after that - and then the sky's open. Might be Under the Bed, Dogs, Agon or TsoY.<br/>
<br/>
3. Burning Warhammer - we had the first session yesterday. Still trying to get a good grasp of some of the basic elements of the system. Yesterday we had a few versus tests and some Duels of Wits. I have a great feeling about this campaign. It's planned as a semi-long campaign (around 20 sessions or so), and I'm eagerly looking forward to getting to a point, where we'll not worry about remembering rules, but just be engaged in the game and use the system to full effect.<br/>
<br/>
So - a glorious Autumn of gaming for me - which makes me very happy.<br/>
<br/>
Best<br/>

<br/>
My thursday night Etherscope game, the League of Expendable Gentlemen, has just started up again after a month long hiatus.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would love to hear more about your Etherscope game<br/>
Tad<br/>
<br/>
I hope to get my PBP/PBEM Fantasy game going, and potentially even play it once a month or so in person.<br/>
Also have some ideas for a modern/sf exploration game if i find any interest.<br/>
Otherwise it is just a hope....                        </div>

                            My plan for this autumn:<br/><br/>- Wrap up my A|State game - or at least bring the current phase of it to a satisfying conclusion - to a close before termtime begins, and then decide how I want to proceed with it. When term begins, the university roleplaying society's calendar of events will start up again, so people's calendars will fill up and the slot that A|State has occupied will be gone. I may freeze it and thaw it out again after term finishes, I may convert it to a play-by-email thing instead. I might just end it.<br/><br/>- Play in the two-term segment of the current roleplaying society freeform/social LARP, <a href="http://www.legacy-empire.org.uk" rel="nofollow">Legacy</a>, and kick off the experimental society-wide tabletop game I and others have been designing.<br/><br/>- Continue playing in the ongoing Ars Magica campaign and look forward to an upcoming Pendragon campaign. Mid-80s medievalist gaming at its finest.                        </div>

                            Well, our new gaming group kicked off actual gaming last night with a rather nifty first session of DitV. Probably the game will last another one or two sessions. Then it's moving on through the pile of stuff that I hauled back from Gen Con. There's a lot of keenness to play Shock:, Don't Rest Your Head and many others. We'll also need to get to grips with the Roach, which we played a short session of a while back but ended up having more questions than answers. Of course, first time play may have been a factor here, but I think it's certainly a game we all want to play again and actually get to grips with.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                        </div>

                            Things are looking pretty sweet for me.<br/><br/>Last night was the third session of a Polaris game with myself, Nancy and two of our friends. A knight controlled a demon whirlwind by sticking his flute in it and playing its wind into submission. Another knight is turning paranoid, ever more sure that his fellows want him dead. A comrade was struck down in combat and now wasting away despite the efforts of the best healers in the remnant. Good stuff. We're Taking our time, but one of us just hit veteran.<br/><br/>Tomorrow night is the first play session of a short Weapons of the Gods game. It's the first time I've run that sort of hi-crunch, hi-prep game in a full year or two, and it's taking some getting used to. Hopefully we'll be able to just dive in with some kung-fu awesome and not draw it out too long.<br/><br/>I've been told that I am Required to run Burning Empires once a couple of my friends get back for school, so that should be starting up in the next few weeks.<br/><br/>Last week, I had a whole bunch of friends over and we gave Battlestations a try. We had a ripping good time, and will almost certainly be gathering again soon for another mission or two.                        </div>

What would you like to know Tad? We play using mirc and use a <a href="http://etherscope.wikispaces.com/" rel="nofollow">wiki</a> to record transcripts of the sessions. The party are a group of nobles, academics, doctors and ne'er-do-wells blackmailed into working for the British Government by the mysterious Pevensey. Essentially they're being used as disposable and deniable assets by a spy, although already they've double crossed him ...                        </div>

                            Right now my regular Sunday face-to-face group of friends are playing a post-apocalyptic medieval Burning Wheel game.  We just got through making characters and setting up the world and everything, hopefully it will go well and I'll actually throw up some actual play posts somewhere like I always want to.<br/>
<br/>
My friends and I are also playing some old school D&amp;D modules (Temple of Elemental Evil) using Castles and Crusades, but there is no set schedual, and we only really play that when everyone is together and we don't have any other video-gaming or board-gaming going on.                        </div>

                            My group is playing The Mountain Witch when everyone is there and Dogs in the Vineyard if we have absentees. Dogs is really a hit with the group, something I found a bit surprising as we generally spend a lot of time joking around. Serious issues usually get sidelined to humour and action. So that's all good.<br/><br/>I also played a game of The Shab-al-Hiri roach with my wife, sister and brother in law. Me and my sister are both serious gamer types but the others not so much. In fact, it may have been my brother in law's first try. That went really well, and I'm going to try and organise a few more of these low social footprint games for friends who are interested. Shock: will probably be on the cards for the next one.                        </div>

                            We just began the "serious playing" part of Burning Wheel with the Bi-weekly group, and it's awesome.  It feels like the backstabbery of AMBER but with Thieves' guild elites.<br/>
<br/>
Also, just an hour ago we just finished playing one of the first ever Tenra Bansho sessions in English. I was woefully underprepared, but it rocked anyway. Everyone had fun and great feedback.<br/>

                            I just want you all to know I'm jealous. <br/><br/>I have a Saturday night game that goes from 8:30pm to midnight, and if I'm lucky, there will be 4 sessions a month. Most of the time it's 3 or less sessions. We try to play long running campaigns, but we also try to play as many different games, so we are often in conflict.<br/><br/>With the demands of wife and children and job...I simply cannot afford to spend any more time gaming as much as I'd like to. This really is fall gaming for me, the twilight of my gaming days. Soon it will be winter, and there will be no more. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> </div>

                            It's not fall you silly wrong-hemisphere people!  It's spring.  The blossom is out, the flowers are blooming, the days are getting warmer and it's light in the mornings when I wake up again.  And even better, my wedding is over and my life is no longer being consumed by endless wedding planning, so I should have some time to play.<br/>
<br/>
I have the ongoing D&amp;D game I should not be playing, with two best friends who like D&amp;D and me playing a character with more focus on his struggle to become a good dad than his ability to make Legolas look like a shortsighted clutz.  Silly wrongbadfun that works because I know that's what it is and we enjoy each other's company rather than stressing about the game.<br/>
<br/>
Finish off (finally!) the 6th session of our Game Salon's run of Hero Quest set in the Dark Ages, as GMed by droog/Jeff.  I'm hoping to die this session.  Preferably at the hands of one of the other PCs.  Gimmie full on screaming martyrdom!  Or I could try not to die.  But hey, I rather suspect is all going to end badly for my PC and I shall enjoy the tragedy.<br/>
<br/>
Then I think I'm supposed to be playing an arse-kicker in the Game Salon run of In Nomine.  Kicking arse is not my usual idea of fun, but I can enjoy it for a few sessions.<br/>
<br/>
And after In Nomine I think we've got Little Fears coming up, and after that I'm not sure.  That probably will take us to Summer, and I'm starting to plot out some stuff for over the holidays.<br/>

I am dying to hear more about your BW game. Sounds wild.Well, the GM of this game fell through, so I'll be unable to post an actual play.  The rest of the players (myself included) are kind of grumpy because of some social contract breaching stuff, so it looks like in place of this we are doing some Mortal Coil.                        </div>

                            We're mid way through character burning for my new game of BE over skype. Had the world burning on sunday and wound up with an ocean world covered in pack ice, where the people live beneath the surface in giant city ships menaced by huge sharks. I get to play the Vaylen and am gonna have a field day if I can hull one of them sharks!<br/><br/>I've never played a game on skype though, so am not sure how it will work out. Anyone got any advice for me? How do you handle things like maps or diagrams?                        </div>

                            I run two games these days.<br/><br/>My wednesday group is in the climax of our Mutants in Shadows game. Mutants in Shadows is an old (1991) game, in which the PCs are people with psychich powers, who are used by the world government's secret services (the M services) as weapons and special agents. The PCs are part of an organization of free mutants under the name of Heracles, directed by the most powerful precognitor ever. Well, we've been playing this game for a bit more than a year, and the PCs just discovered that they have a high - level mole in Heracles... in the middle of the biggest offensive against the CDFC (the USA M service) ever done. <br/><br/>My sunday group has just started a CoC campaign set in 1926, centered around two big focus: the raid of the government in Innsmouth, and the ascension of R'lyeh from the original HPL tale. We've played two sessions, and it's been a blast.                        </div>

                            Now is the autumn of our content...<br/><br/>Well, I finally got my group back together (after an embarassingly fitful schedule) last tuesday for a game of John O'Brien's Caper: A game of Pros and Cons. I'm putting off writing about the game until we get the second session under our belt, but what we've played so far has been mostly awesome, with a bit of chaff from having two players new to gm-less games. Major point for John: this game looks like it's going in our regular line-up.<br/><br/>This game also gave us a prime opportunity to pull out some lists from the names project, giving us Peter "Shovelface" Giacone, and Brennan O'Doherty, not to mention "Butcher Knife" Giorgio. Can't wait for the hard copy.                        </div>

                            Well, for the Autumn, I'm still running a twice per month Shackled City campaign, and next week wrapping up (for the time being) some Conspiracy X (also twice a month).  The latter becomes a two-part CoC game for October (run by one of my players) as a nice Halloween break.<br/>
<br/>
Next Sat, I'm running True 20 at EndGame for Chris Pramas and others, and I'm running some IG Steampunk Musha at the October EG minicon.<br/>
<br/>
I'm also lining up a one-shot of Cold City, and a five episode PTA series of Gotham Noir.                        </div>

                            Gotham Noir - the idea (or elevator pitch anyhow) is a series set in 40's / 50's Gotham City.  Gotham, already known for its badness, it beginning to slip over the edge and descend into really awful darkness and crime.<br/>
<br/>
The protagonists are roughly envisioned as men and women of means and / or determination who decide to take matters into their hands and turn the tide.<br/>
<br/>
It's partly from an actual play idea from Dan Bayn, of Wushu fame.<br/>
<br/>
Probably something like noir - crime drama / low powered crime fighting.                        </div>
