Since it's been quite a while since I've started playing, I thought I'd solicit for some advice. Some DOs and DON'Ts. So far all I did was checking out who's interested and now that we have a tenative date I've asked which Setting (Fantasy, Sci-Fi...) or Genre (Action, Adventure, Horror, Drama) the different people would be interested yet. I haven't heard back yet but I am wondering if I'm overwhelming people there. Would it be better to think up a couple one-shot concepts (Likeable space-pirates on a suicide mission for good, students on a boat without power and something eeevil...) and let them choose from them? What do you guys think?<br/><br/>Also regardless of Setting or Genre I was thinking of using the FATE 3 system, without stunts, and pregenerating characters to reduce the rules people have to learn. I don't have enough Fudge dice though so I might just use some other dice mechanic (D6-D6 for example). I hope that's a good choice.<br/><br/>Apart from that, what other suggestions do you guys have? Or any interesting (positive and negative) experiences about introducing "newbies" to the hobby?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221566/#Comment_221566" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-30T02:52:45+00:00" title="July 30, 2009  2:52AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Run whatever genre you're most excited about; it's contagious.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the pre-gens: people love to make characters on there own.

If you've never played IAWA, the game begins with all the players choosing four Oracles ... setting and story elements chosen from a random generator in the game. (Stuff like "Three horsemen, riding as fast as they can away from the castle".)  Then, once the four basic story elements are chosen, the group decides, together, who the main characters of the story are, and then each player chooses as character from that list.<br><br>Why I think this works extra well for new gamers ... it gets people engaged in the story right off the bat, in a very straighforward manner. That portion of the game is really no different than a parlor game; it's something people can quickly grasp. Then, when you start introducing the "role-playing game" stuff (ie - characters, stats, conflict rules), they're already invested in the game and, more importantly, they're already having a good time.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221674/#Comment_221674" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-30T12:12:06+00:00" title="July 30, 2009 12:12PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd suggest The Pool and Primetime Adventures for bringing people into the hobby who aren't familiar with more traditional games.

Now you want to figure out the best way to make that first game fun, exciting, and drama-free. I have played games with a lot of game "virgins."<br/><br/>Pick something familiar to them. They probably love Star Wars, so that's a safe bet. A lot of games have really simple pitches that everyone gets, too.<br/><br/>Pick a game with a low barrier to entry. I mean in terms of prerequisites, startup difficulty, and time commitment. I've had great success with newbies playing Dogs in the Vineyard, Shab-al-Hiri Roach, and My Life with Master. Each has a simple and compelling hook, and none requires very a lot of genre knowledge. I've had less success with Dungeons &amp; Dragons. I have had difficulty with Sorcerer. <br/><br/>Pick games that don't drop them into the spotlight and insist the be super-creative. Games like Shock: and Misspent Youth in which you essentially have to invent the setting at the table can be tough on new folks. I've had some success there anyway because the hook and rules are simple, but it was more of an uphill battle.<br/><br/>Ignore the weird outlier rules. Focus on the main gameplay. I mean, in the old days, you could play D&amp;D without knowing any of the rules as long as someone was telling you what die to roll. You just focused on deciding what your character did, and people told you, "Okay, roll this d20 then. You hit. Now roll this d6. You do 3 damage. The orc bleeds and screams obscenities at you!" With D&amp;D 4E, players need to make a lot of tricky, tactical decisions about which powers to use. I wouldn't toss a gaming novice at that game without a very simplified character sheet and scenario.<br/><br/>Focus on the best parts of role-playing: telling stories, imagining awesome events, and making decisions that matter.<br/><br/>Don't call them "virgins" or "newbies." It makes them self-conscious. In fact, do nothing to call attention to their novitiate status. Make them feel like one of the regulars.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221686/#Comment_221686" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-30T12:38:46+00:00" title="July 30, 2009 12:38PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: BWA</cite>You didn't ask for game recommendations, but I have run In A Wicked Age for people in similar circumstances with great success.</blockquote>I'll second IAWA, and add that you can use any of the generators at Abulafia (or whatever it's called) to do something other than Hyborian sword and sorcery, if that doesn't interest the group. Alternately, it's not TOO hard to drift the game's provided Oracles for other genres. I did just that for a "modern period" game--just shifted anything obviously fantasy to its modern equivalent.<br/><br/>Of course, it can be a bit tricky to get them to embrace ONYFDA as the key to rolling--my group at a con demo kept trying to "roll to persuade" and such-like. The three beat sequence is also a bit hard to grok, at first. Also, work with them to make Particular Strengths, mainly so that they are relatively equally useful in play. Best Interests are usually easy enough to get written, once you start unpacking the characters and situation from the Oracles.<br/><br/>Hmmm... maybe IAWA isn't ideal for newbies. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Then again, I was demoing for a bunch of hard-crunch, ultra-trad Shadowrun players, so maybe I faced more "unlearning" than you would with true neophytes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221701/#Comment_221701" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-30T13:17:10+00:00" title="July 30, 2009  1:17PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 30, 2009 1:21PM by ccreitz.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only way to start is to play. Adam mentioned a low barrier to entry and a short time commitment, plus a familiar setting, which I think is a good set of principles. I dropped "My Uncle the Baron" on two guys last night who, till then, had never story-gamed before, one an old friend but the other a guy I had met an hour before. It was a ton of fun and we were the last three people out of the bar.  Thinking along the lines Adam articulated, I drifted the Baron's Ludens Minor to be about fictionalized us, fictionalized now, trusting the one-up mechanic to create crazy extrapolation, and sure enough, after a few minutes, we had gone from encountering a bear in the Pennsylvania woods to post-apocalyptic DJs spinning hit records by a Tito-fronted undead Jackson 5.<br/><br/><br/>Having a game or two memorized helps.

The system encourages the players to make their characters do over-the-top things, simply because they're nearly invincible (5-7 Stress boxes per track, which are scratched off after each scene, plus 3 Consequences of various stickiness). I think a horror game in particular would be near-unplayable with vanilla FATE, and a FATE/Planescape campaign I ran once with slightly drifted rules - while awesome fun - didn't exactly capture the D&amp;D feel of having to care for your character's well-being. It works great for SotC pulp, but unless you intend on hacking the heck out of it, make sure your game's genre fits with the mechanics.<br/><br/>I've introduced quite a few people to independent games via Spirit of the Century, and it's worked really well for me with players who are already familiar with tabletop RPG rules. It's a fantastic gateway game, but possibly not excellent as a game for first-timers. The in-game character creation option is fantastic though, since it reduces the buy-in required and allows everyone to make an effective and appropriate character without having fully grasped all the nuances of your scenario pitch. For short scenarios, I usually make half-finished characters with a few Skills and Aspects, and let the players fill in the rest as they need them or think they'd be cool.<br/><br/>I second (third? fourd?) In A Wicked Age. As per David's suggestion, use a custom Oracle if the players aren't particularly into Sword &amp; Sorcery. The particular ingredients are hugely important to create buy-in, since it determines both the flavour of the story and the characters involved.<br/><br/>All other suggestions in this thread are similarly fantastic, and there's little need for me to echo them. Suffice to say, make sure you're enthusiastic (the more the better), don't worry <i>overly</i> much about the rules at first (especially not the nitty-gritty ones), and "newb" is a patronizing term - don't use it. One of the game organizing bodies I subscribe to have a tendency of calling games "newb-friendly" (or not) and it just makes me want to punch <i>everyone</i> - the organizers of the game for using patronizing terminology, and the organizers of the other games for implicitly <i>not</i> being "newb-friendly".<br/><br/>Best wishes for your game!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Democritus" title="Democritus"><img alt="Democritus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://studweb.stud.uni-stuttgart.de/studweb/users/arc/arc37948/images/misc/avatar_amber_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Democritus">Democritus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221721/#Comment_221721" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-30T14:23:51+00:00" title="July 30, 2009  2:23PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks everyone for the replies.<br/><br/>I know I didn't suggest games but you've made me curious. If you've got any more suggestions for newbie-friendly (sorry but I know no other way to say this) games, especially free ones - let me know.<br/><br/>About IAWA. I don't have it and getting it + printing it + reading it + getting a good enough grasp on the rules to run it is propably not doable right now. I'll file it for future reference though.<br/><br/>PTA is another good suggestion, and a game I actually own but have no play experience with. I don't think it lends itself well to a one-shot though?<br/><br/>Because this is intended to be a one shot simply because people don't want to commit too much time. Especially not if they don't know what they're getting into. That's one of the main reasons I wanted to go for pre-generated characters. This gives you a lot more play-time during the one-shot and if the variety of characters is big enough, then there should be something for everyone. Plus I really dig Iachek's idea of leaving some blank spots on the character sheets for the players to fill.<br/><br/>Also if my players would be willing to go for a Horror story, I was considering using Geiger Counter because I've been itching to play it AND it seems to be very close to movies, which we're all familiar with. I think generally building from movies or popular books is a good starting point. There a lot of people have a common ground from which to work from.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221733/#Comment_221733" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-30T15:48:09+00:00" title="July 30, 2009  3:48PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The time committment thing is a big one. People are not used to playing a game that can take 3+ hours.<br/><br/>But even when I play with my gamer friends, we try to play shorter games than we once did. So that may be more a function of not being in high school.<br/><br/>Also, even thought I've run RPGs for non-gamer friends, and it went great and everyone had a lot of fun, the idea of doing it on a regular, frequent basis doesn't go over. People can see playing AGAIN .. like in a month or so, but playing every week or every other week has never interested any non-gamers I've played with.<br/><br/>That's not a complaint, or even a useful comment.

It has a low foot print, quick character creation and a simple concept. I did run into one problem once, because the idea of a horror genre spoof only makes sense to a typical Western audience. I ended up drifting the setting and concept to Victorian mystery, and had to use coins and napkins, as that's all we had available.<br/><br/>These days though, if I have dice and a setting sheet, I'm just as likely turn to Coming of Age. A little more foot print than Inspectres, but the dramatic tension combined with the way the characters become more capable during the course of the game seem to be very encouraging to new players. It presents a subtle (or maybe not so subtle) emotional reinforcement that roleplaying can be fun. <br/><br/>Both, Inspectres and Coming of Age are heavily player focused, which I feel is important for introducing RPGs. I think player empowerment should be at the forefront. It's too easy to present RPGs as audience-based fun, rather than collaborative fun. And it is really that later which distinguishes it from other types of entertainments and genres.<br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221792/#Comment_221792" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-31T08:00:07+00:00" title="July 31, 2009  8:00AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wouldn't be afraid of IAWA - the rule text is what, 14 pages or so? The system is easy, procedural and easily explainable. $10 for the PDF directly from <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/wicked.html" rel="nofollow">lumpley</a> and it's well worth it. I've found it works well even when you have players using a mixed bag of stances and styles as well, although I've heard complaints about it lending itself to "competitive" play (between the characters, not necessarily between players) - which works well for me, but not for everyone.<br/><br/>As for the time commitment, it's a subject I've thought a lot about lately. I personally have never seen it being that big of an issue for me, but that's likely because gaming is my hobby of choice. On the other hand, I have found that I "do not have time" for martial arts three times a week in two hour sessions. I think it's all about what hobby you're committed to, not necessarily how much "time you have". Therefore, it may be hard getting non-gamers or casual gamers into a regular campaign, but if you start with setting up a monthly schedule and gradually schedule more frequent sessions for people who are really enthusiastic about the hobby, it might work just fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221795/#Comment_221795" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-31T08:08:06+00:00" title="July 31, 2009  8:08AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd also recommend InSpectres, for the dominant reason that everyone knows and loves Ghostbusters. As mentioned regarding Star Wars above, a common and compelling baseline is very powerful.<br/><br/>Also agreed on the urgency of presenting the hobby as a collaborative, player-focused activity to new gamers especially. If you fall into the "I'm going to tell you a story" mode of play, it will be hard to attract people who might otherwise be going to see an expert-produced, 100-million budget movie or two in the same timespan as a single tabletop session.<br/><br/>Another reason to play a short-form, serial- or anthology-style game like IAWA or InSpectres rather than FATE - the systems tell good, compelling, self-enclosed stories within the span of a few hours of play. I've played one-shots of FATE/SotC before, and they're great, but the relative crunch of the system and the typical mode of play seems to lend itself better to longer-form campaign play (4-5 sessions per story). I know that's counter to the game's intended purpose as a pick-up game, and maybe others have experiences that prove me dead wrong, but that's my observation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthew_SB" title="Matthew_SB"><img alt="Matthew_SB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthew_SB">Matthew_SB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221838/#Comment_221838" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-31T12:39:32+00:00" title="July 31, 2009 12:39PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 31, 2009 2:40PM by Matthew_SB.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will throw in a recommendation for <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/games/unstore/game/55" rel="nofollow">Serial Homicide Unit</a>.  The initial premise will be familiar to anyone who has seen crime drama, while the majority of the play is intimate and about the lives of common folks.  The 30 minute CD walks through the game premise, setting up, and all the instructions for playing the game.  It is very smooth and procedural, and plays easy at the table.  Game length is around three hours.  All the components to play the game are included in the DVD case, aside from pencils, 5 d6 per player and a CD or mp3 player.<br/><br/>We just played this Saturday for the first time(though with experienced gamers), and it was very successful.  I am writing up the AP for the game and will be posting it soon.  It is definitely one of a handful of games I would use to introduce first timers to RPGs.  As a one-shot, it lacks the anthology potential of some of the other suggestions, but as an introduction it seems like it would be great.<br/><br/>[edit] Also, SHU has an electronic version, with PDFs of all the components and mp3s of the CD tracks, available on <a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16765&amp;cat=0&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">IPR</a> if getting the physical version is prohibative for time/cost reasons.  Since the CD/mp3s teach the game as you play, "learning" the game beforehand shouldn't be an issue.<br/><br/>Geiger Counter is a great suggestion as well!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
