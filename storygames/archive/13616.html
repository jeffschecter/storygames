That was all long ago, when lives were larger, before things were settled. Now, if there is any greatness left, it is great evil, evil that will change the world for the worse. In the last hour of that age, a new story begins. Will it be the story of a hero, rising up to save what is good and true about the old age to shepherd it into the new? Or will it be a sad lament for things long gone, to usher in a new age of darkness? It is now the final hour of a storied age, and telling the tale falls to you.<br/><br/><i>Storied Age</i> is a no-prep, GM-less storytelling game that, over a few sessions of play, creates an epic fantasy story in the vein of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, <i>The Wheel of Time</i>, or <i>The Sword of Truth</i>. The game weaves together creative contributions from each player around a structured plot arc and then helps you play through a chapter-by-chapter account of how your characters face adversity, echoing how an author starts with an outline and fleshes it out into a full novel. By distributing responsibilities and providing creative constraints to guide players\u2019 contributions, <i>Final Hour of a Storied Age</i> lets everyone experience an epic fantasy story without asking anyone to shoulder an epic creative burden.</blockquote>\nI'm looking for beta playtest groups for my game <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/final-hour-of-a-storied-age/" rel="nofollow">Final Hour of a Storied Age</a>. The playtesting I've done with the 0.67 revision has been very successful, producing fun sessions and really satisfying Epic Fantasy stories. There have been a few hiccups along the way, but they all seemed to be in line with the problems that any new group might have when learning a new game. In order to get a better handle on what still needs work in the game before I officially publish (either with the mechanics themselves or with they way I explain them in the text) I need some feedback from groups playing the game without my direct participation. I would really appreciate any beta playtesting people are willing to do for me. I would absolutely love audio recordings of the game in play, honest reactions, AP reports, or really any feedback people would be willing to give me. I'm happy to answer questions about the game, and would appreciate feedback or discussion about the text itself even if you're unable to playtest.<br/><br/>I believe the game works best with 3 or 4 players, but might work with as few as 2 or as many as 5. The recent playtests I've done have been 3 player games and have both finished story arcs in four 3-hour sessions. I posted the first arc in AP podcast form as episodes 10 to 13 of the <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/podcast" rel="nofollow">Designer vs. Reality podcast</a>, and in text summary form on my blog (<a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/2010/10/15/final-hour-of-a-storied-age-playtest-7a/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/2010/10/25/final-hour-of-a-storied-age-playtest-7b/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/2010/11/10/final-hour-of-a-storied-age-playtest-7c/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/2010/11/14/final-hour-of-a-storied-age-playtest-7d/" rel="nofollow">here</a>). I've got the audio from the second arc in the can I'll be editing that and posting podcasts and text summaries over the next few weeks.<br/><br/>I think there's value in transparency in the design process so I'm happy to discuss the game in the open (I blog <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a> and participate here on Story-Games as well as <a href="http://www.story-games.com/praxis/" rel="nofollow">Praxis</a>, <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/" rel="nofollow">The Forge</a>, and <a href="http://www.rpggeek.com/" rel="nofollow">RPG Geek</a>).

Our two story arcs each took around four three-hour sessions to complete.<br/><br/>You could potentially run the game as a three or four slot 'mega-session', or as a multi-session, multi-group serial where each subsequent session/group carries on from where the previous group left off.  However, I think the latter would fail to provide all of the participating players' of the full and true experience of playing Storied Age.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307839/#Comment_307839" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-11T18:50:42+00:00" title="January 11, 2011  6:50PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Leo, it would be hard to do as a one-shot.

Let me try to rectify that a bit! First, when I say \u201cEpic Fantasy\u201d, I'm not using \u201cepic\u201d as a kind of all-purpose superlative that it has come to mean in the broader gaming community. I'm also not using it in the \u201clevels 20 to 30 in D&amp;D\u201d sense of flashy over-the-top magic. I'm talking about the Epic Fantasy literary genre \u2013 the genre that essentially started with <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> by J.R.R. Tolkien and is continued today by writers like Brandon Sanderson. Not all fantasy is Epic Fantasy, and Epic Fantasy isn't the right vehicle for every fantasy idea. For example, Sword and Sorcery, which is popular in a lot of other indie games, is a distinct genre from Epic Fantasy. Sword and Sorcery fantasy tends to be tightly focused on individual characters, and when societies are present they're often corrupt or evil. Epic Fantasy stories, on the other hand, tend to be more hopeful. The premise of my game is that epic fantasy is about defending what it good about a community from an existential threat \u2013 the iconic example being Frodo undertaking the quest to destroy the ring in order to save The Shire. <br/><br/>When people hear that there's a Tolkien influence on my game their eyes sometimes glaze over because they've come to associate a Tolkien influence with \u201cgeneric fantasy\u201d. That's not surprising, because lots of other games and media properties have copied superficial elements of The Lord of the Rings to deliver bland experiences. My game takes the opposite approach: it's finding the heart of what differentiates books like The Lord of the Rings from generic fantasy, giving you a game structure that delivers that experience, and leveraging the creativity of the people at the table to contribute the personalizing details like setting and characterization so that you get a solid Epic Fantasy story every time (at least that's the intention \u2013 I need help testing to confirm that the mechanics are delivering the experience I want them to at the table when I'm not directly involved).<br/><br/>As I asked over in the praxis thread, I'd love to hear about it if there are things holding people back from giving my game a shot. I'm not a great salesman, so questions or comments from the people reading this thread could really help me improve my communication.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
