I think it might be possible to use Sorcerer to run a TNG game. It would work a little like this:<br/><br/>Humanity becomes <i>Humanism</i>. <br/>Stamina and Will stay the same.<br/>Lore becomes <i>24th Century Knowledge</i>.<br/><br/>Cover becomes <i>Hobby</i>.<br/>Price becomes <i>Fault</i>.<br/><br/>Demons become <i>Roles</i>. Instead of having Demons be NPCs in their own rights, they become social roles the Sorcerer would have to fulfill. Example roles would include:<br/><br/>Starfleet Officer<br/>Klingon<br/>Android<br/>Department Head (Engineering)<br/>etc.<br/><br/>Needs would become <i>Duties</i>.<br/>I'm not sure what to do with Desires yet. I can't see them serving any purpose in Star Trek TNG game, so I might just chuck them. <br/><br/>Starting characters would usually have multiple roles, and could both expand (bind) or reduce (banish) them as the individual games progressed.<br/><br/>Each episode would introduce a new Kicker to start off the episode and be resolved at the end of it. Bangs would be far less prevalent in such a game. TNG was a lot of things, but intense was not one of them. At least not as far as character development, character revelation and the like was concerned. That's simply not what drew people to the show. You'd probably have one Bang per episode and that's it. <br/><br/>Both technology and technobabble would be notably absent from any representation in the rules, as they simply don't carry any narrative weight in the show. (Or ever, for that matter.) <br/><br/>Comments?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
