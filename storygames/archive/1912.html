                    This topic has <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1904" rel="nofollow">taken over another thread</a> but deserves its own.  Paul writes:
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>This is where I think you want to be in an ashcan:<br/><br/>The game rules have been playtested and are 90% solid in the your opinion. You're doing an ashcan not because you can't manage a playtest of your own, but because the game isn't quite delivering on your design goals and so you don't consider it fully baked yet.<br/><br/>The text is written not with the aim of a fully baked game, to communicate the architecture of play to the customer, and to inspire play with the fullness of its vision, but with the goal of provoking playtesting and feedback toward the as-yet-unrealized design goals. As such, the text includes overt language about the game's design goals, and directly calls out mechanics that need validation and/or refinement.<br/><br/>The text invites the purchaser into conversation with you the designer.<br/><br/>The book as an object has a hand assembled or copy shop aesthetic and is clearly not "store ready".<br/><br/>But neither should it be cheap looking. If you can manage it, you want to put some love into the crafting of the books, like the indie comics guys do with their little photocopied comics, because that's how you subliminalize a message to prospective buyers that you love the game and won't be flaking out if they choose to enter into your design process.<br/><br/>Price: ~$10.00. Your design work won't be furthered by an over lubrication of the price. You want a price that triggers self identification of an engaged feedback community.<br/><br/>Yes, unless you have illicit access to printing or photocopying at your workplace it's going to cost you more per unit in time and materials to make ashcans than it would to use a POD printer to print books. But this isn't the profit taking stage of indie publishing. This is the development stage.</blockquote>
My initial thought is to question the value of a lovingly printed product.  I recently sent .pdf files of the current version of Grey Ranks to a few people for comment - considerably cheaper and more efficient.  Is there a psychosocial benefit to having a semi-product you paid a few dollars for?  The tactile advantage of paper versus screen?  Let's discuss ashcans, because it seems like a model that is useful and effective in other media.                </div>

<p>It seems super-awesome to me.  The idea of producing an ashcan version of <em>the Infected</em> is really very appealing to me.  Is there a psychosocial benefit?  I think there might be.  I think people who pay for something are more likely to play it.  And I think someone who paid for an insider's ticket is more likely to give the designer quality feedback.</p>
<p>I'm imagining that a very limited ashcan release, plus maybe a bit of name recognition, will yeild a handful of very dedicated playtesters and feedback monkeys.  I'm predicting that we'll be seeing quite a few ashcan releases in the near future.  And I think the most successful ones will be the ones where the author is offering the best deal, or the ones where the author is already well known.</p>

                            OK, I'm not opposed to this, but I need to ask some hard questions here - why should people pay for the privilege of helping you refine your game?  It seems backwards to me - you should be sending them out free, with a Mountain Dew coupon tucked in them or something.  <br/><br/>"My game isn't done.  Playing it may not be fun.  I'm charging you five bucks for a copy.  Please help me make it better."<br/><br/>Again, I don't think I have a handle on all the angles here, so help me out.  Eric, you may be right about payment = investment, but somehow it seems abusive to me.                        </div>

<p>Well, I can only imagine it would be abusive if the deal wasn't good.  And if the deal isn't good, then who's going to buy in?  I mean, if you charge $10 for the game with the promise of $5 off the finished version, then all the customer is really paying for is the printing cost and shipping.</p>
<p>But lemmie turn the tables for one second and talk about it from a consumer's point of view, instead of from a designer's.</p>
<p>Let's say that you put out an ashcan version of Grey Ranks.  It's got that $10/5 pricetag on it.  From my point of view, I'm giving you $5 for the physical copy I get in my hands, and I'm putting a $5 deposit down on <em>being an insider</em>.  Ok, yeah, I'm going to end up doing work for you and putting a deposit down on you letting me do it.  But what I get in return is the bragging rights to say "Yeah, I was totally part of the GR ashcan crew.  See my name in the small print right there?  Yeah, that's me.  My groups' playtest feedback was totally responsible for the Grundle Mechanism."</p>
<p>So, what do I get out of my initial $10 expenditure?  A pre-release copy of the game, bragging rights, the realization that my input will be valuable to the designer, and a discount on the final product.</p>
<p>The more I think about it, the less I think you CAN be abusive about an ashcan release if you're upfront about what the consumer is getting.  You could charge $100 for a copy you printed at work on the broken photocopier with no promises at all about what the consumer gets in return.  If they buy, then they still want in on that deal.  The consumer made their decision aware.  What's abusive about that?</p>

                            Me, I'd sell ashcans at cost (just print cost, not including any promo art or whatever).  I think there's a substantial chance that print copies of games would get played more, since they're easier to carry around.  It's harder for me to get away with printing off a playtest draft PDF at work than it is to lug around the $3 ashcan I got from Lulu. And I don't really see it as people paying to help you with your game.  After all, they're not required to tell you anything.  They can just enjoy playing the game as is.  And that's what I think of an ashcan as.  It's like going to an early screening of an unfinished film or watching dress rehearsals of a play.                        </div>

                            OK, maybe I just have some ethical hesitation of charging for my dress rehearsal.

                            Another issue is relative circulation. Do you want to make money back, or do you want to get it into lots of people's hands? Will the price affect this? I sent free copies of bti at GenCon 04 brought me a lot of feedback and recognition of the game. It was just a cheapy, I doubt as many people would have picked it up if it had cost anything.                        </div>

                            Jason, one of the "psychosocial" benefits of the ashcan is getting something tangible and <em>done</em> that you can hold in your hand.  I think this would counteract a lot of the rush-to-print impulse that we see produce half-baked games.  It allows designers to get a sense of accomplishment <em>and</em> be upfront and say, "this isn't fully baked yet."<br/><br/>As to why anybody would buy it, I think Eric's got the right of the insider track angle to it.  In addition to bobble-head agreeing, I think it's also worthwhile to point out that this can help you mark out some brainspace -- because once people have the ashcan in their hands, they'll be playing, and posting, and people will be seeing APs and discussions, which will drive eventual sales.<br/><br/>Also, this could take the bite out of doing a print run: if your ashcans all contribute a couple bucks, those bucks can stack up and defray costs.                        </div>

                            Also, to repeat an idea from the other thread that was awesome: taking copies to conventions and giving them to people who sign up for your game.  Their buy-in isn't cash, it's that four hour block of time.  They've got real play experience under their belt, hopefully some excitement about the game, and are perhaps more likely to get their friends at home to play the game they enjoyed at the con.                        </div>

                            A word about the "dress rehearsal" angle - professional theatre has a thing called Preview, where people can come and watch the dress rehearsal (sometimes many of them) before the show officially opens. Sometimes this is invite only; sometime's its a lower ticket price; sometimes it's open to the public with a suggested donation. Previews are cool because you get to see something in the process, sometimes for cheap, and sometimes something that you wouldn't have the opportunity to see at full price.<br/><br/>I think all of those models (invite, lower price, suggested donation) are adaptable to ashcan releases.                        </div>

                            Alrighty, as a basis for further ashcan conversation, here we have Scott Knipe's Wyrd:<br/><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="image" height="323" src="http://www.halfmeme.com/images/wyrd-cover.jpg" width="214"/></div><br/><br/>It's an awesome ashcan. It's a 36 page book, half letter size and saddle-stitched, with cover stock slightly heaver than the interior pages, and with at least ten illustrations (including the cover). Scott gave ~80 of these away for free at GenCon in 2001. Some toner on the cover of mine is worn away from use when we playtested it. Here's a scan of a two page spread from the interior:<br/><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="image" height="315" src="http://www.halfmeme.com/images/wyrd-open.jpg" width="415"/></div><br/><br/>I'm showing Wyrd because I think ashcans should be more than just printouts of playtest texts in booklet form. Your ashcan should have aesthetics that subliminalize how much you love the game.<br/><br/>This is Kill Puppies for Satan, from back when Vincent would mail it to you for free, with the suggestion that you send him a fiver or something in return:<br/><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="image" height="418" src="http://www.halfmeme.com/images/kill-puppies-for-satan.jpg" width="318"/></div><br/><br/>It's letter-sized with a velo binding and a plain uncoated black cover stock. It has no illustrations, but still conveys Vincent's love for the game as powerfully as Wyrd conveys Scott's. Note the use of a mailing label for attaching the game title to the cover. There's another one on the inside lower left corner of the cover with the copyright information. And the interior is set entirely in lowercase in the same vintage typewriter font you see here on the cover. I scanned Kill Puppies for Satan to show some of the range of aesthetics designers have already used to good effect for ashcans.<br/><br/>Up next some scans of indie comics that I think paint a pretty broad landscape of the possible. Here we have the first issue of Matt Kish's Spudd 64:<br/><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="image" height="325" src="http://www.halfmeme.com/images/spudd64-1.jpg" width="210"/></div><br/><br/>It's half-letter, with a green cover stock that he's fabricated the shit out of. The black is toner. Over it he's used stencils and silver spray paint for the titling. The graphic is hand drawn on a fairly grainy off-white construction paper and affixed to the cover with spray glue (I think). On the back, which you can't see, he has the letter "Z" done with stamped ink. I believe this copy is from his very first run of 100. I've seen copies from later runs and if I recall, they don't have the individually hand drawn graphic. I love this book.<br/><br/>Here's the cover of issue two:<br/><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="image" height="329" src="http://www.halfmeme.com/images/spudd64-2.jpg" width="272"/></div><br/><br/>This time the book is half-legal, but again, the black is toner, and the colors are spray paint. You can't see it, but the design extends to the back cover. Clearly he created a stencil for the mauve squiggles.<br/><br/>Which isn't to say you're SOL on the ashcan landscape if you aren't an artist. Here's the full cover spread of Christoph Meyer's What God Has Revealed To Man:<br/><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="image" height="212" src="http://www.halfmeme.com/images/what-god-has-revealed-to-man.jpg" width="318"/></div><br/><br/>He's no artist. He designed it so he could use specific smiley stickers.<br/><br/>Here's Pat Lewis' Hideous: A Monster Romance:<br/><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="image" height="275" src="http://www.halfmeme.com/images/hideous.jpg" width="180"/></div><br/><br/>Like Kish's covers, the black is toner. The cover itself is taupe cardstock. (I think these guys use the heaviest cover stock they can put through a laser printer without jamming. I'm guessing this book and issue one of Spudd 64 both used 60lb stock.) The graphic was printed separately and affixed to the cover. I think it was actually printed to a largeish white address label and then cut and stickered to the cover. When I look close I can see black guidelines through the graphic, part of the photocopying stage that helps him position the graphic. And then he cuts the book down so it has the aspect ratio of a full sized comic.<br/><br/>I have another indie comic I wanted to scan as well, but I can't seem to lay my hands on it. The cover illustration is the face of a man with a blobby alien creature covering his scalp and invading his eyes. It's a photocopied cover, but it's pretty eye catching from the creator having hand colored the alien with a fluorescent green highlighter.<br/><br/>So, graphics, stamping, photocopying, cropping, stencils, spray paint, highlighters, stickers, address labels--find a way to bring some of the game's character out in the crafting of your ashcan.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>

Paul, this sounds a lot like what I'm doing with DL-Quarterly.  I've got a group of games I've tested and polished as much as I can with my current resources.  I'm offering them cheap (less then $9 each all together if you get a subscription) and hoping for some really good feedback on the Actual Play forums.  Thanks for framing the idea for me.  I didn't really know how to explain what it was I was doing exactly.  Now I can.<br/>

                            Heya,<br/>
<br/>
Do I use that boilerplate on the games?  Nope, sure don't.  Probably wouldn't, either.  But I definately do state the design goals right up front.  The first three paragraphs of each game is dedicated to what I want the game to be about, the cahracters to do, and the players to do.  I've talked about this as being an experiment from the get-go and I'm charging so little because I know that my games aren't at the same level as DiTV, MLWM, or Polaris.  I've been up front about doing the layout myself and using artwork only from clip art collections and Ed Heil's Illo Trove.  Anyone who buys my games is someone who has read about them either on my blog or in various game forums.  Therefore, a boilerplate like that is unecessary.  I'm not putting myself on IPR because I don't feel they meet the standard Brennan has set yet.   I'm definately looking for AP feedback and will take what I learn from these and encorperate that into my products in the future.  Until I read your posts about "ashcans" I had no context for what I was doing.  Now I do, and that's cool IMO.  I'm totally on board with what you suggest, and if this experiment works, then I think I can help future designers down this path as well.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine if DL-Quarterly became a home for Ashcan games.  A writer gets a chance to publish his 1st attempt there, see what happens, and then get the critical feedback he needs to write a truly awesome game.  To me, that's a cool idea.  It's part of why I'm doing Socratic Design as well.  But that's all really down-the-road stuff.  It may never happen if this year of DL-Quarterly doesn't succeed.  But anyway, what you wrote really has helped me better understand my own reasons for doing it this way.  That's great, and I appreciate it. :)<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

                            I've been thinking a lot about this thread over the past couple days and I've convinced myself that an ashcan of "The Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries" is a good idea. Getting a lot of solid outside playtesting and advice on the design elements that still perplex me would really help make the game better for an eventual release over the summer.<br/><br/>But here's the sticking point: I don't live near any of the big cons where indie gaming is taking off (MACE, Dexcon, Dreamnation, etc.), and this is my first published design. The ashcan seems to thrive in a face-to-face setting. What can I do to make my ashcan effective despite this? Is the concept of a "digital ashcan" in PDF form viable, or does it fall flat without the physical artifact?<br/><br/>I do plan on taking my game to the local cons here in Arizona, and giving my ashcan to those who sign up for my playtest games is a great idea. But harnessing the insights of you guys out in the rest of world is something I really want to do, too.                        </div>

First off i never knew about Wryd. Someone point me a link to it please if it is still around<br/>
Second point is to me, as I read these, the ashcans could almost be thought of as an evolved 'Zine.<br/>
Take that model, somethign hand made, essentially, and share it, for cost, close to cost, free publicity, etc.<br/>
That seems to be a good metaphor model (works good for me to find a metaphor then comprehension) for the ashcan as it relates to RPGs                        </div>

                            Hey Tad,<br/><br/>Y'know, I think lubricating the price is a mistake. Let's say designers start doing ashcans and next year at GenCon there's a bunch for sale at two to three dollars each. So I come home with seven of them. Every single one of those designers disadvantaged themselves with the two or three dollar price, because I can't possibly commit to providing meaningful feedback and/or playtesting to seven games, and each designer sold to me for less than what the ashcans are worth in time and materials. I bought them out of curiousity, at a price that didn't ask for my commitment of interest. The selling of ashcans isn't publishing. It's a design process. You don't want to sell a hundred ashcans. You want to sell twelve, to exactly the right people. You might have to sell sixty to get the right twelve, but if you sell your sixty for two or three dollars each you're making it easy for those twelve to let life distract them from your game. You've satisfied their curiosity without securing their interest.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>

the solitary editing credit I have in no way compensates for the amount of time, life, money I have put into my gaming and collection<br/>
that being said perhaps my comments should be withdrawn, as my gaming and anything I make from it is solely for creativity sake (thanks) and so perhaps I spoke too soon.<br/>
<br/>
I of course wish every designer who wants to make a game to succeed, and to all that have stuff out there to flourish to what their heart wants it to be.<br/>
have a nice day<br/>
