I'm a huge fan of the show. What I really liked was that there was really rooting for the underdog - Lana and Clark couldn't work, so there was that much extra hope that maybe they could make it work, and Lex was going to be evil so there was the hope that he could maybe turn out good.<br/><br/>A lot of it was carrot on a stick, but it was enjoyable anyway.<br/><br/>So I'm wondering what the focus of the game is. Do you play as main characters from the show, and have some alternate history stuff going on, so Chlark, Clana, Chlollie and Lolliver fans can all have their cake?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291836/#Comment_291836" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-06T19:39:44+00:00" title="September  6, 2010  7:39PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 6, 2010 9:21PM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The game is focused around interpersonal struggles within a group of characters that constantly interact (and may or may not have super-powers).  The scale of the disagreements is pretty variable; a heated argument, silver-tongued persuasion, and lasers to the face all use the same basic mechanic, the difference is in which traits are being invoked for the roll, and what kind of Stress can result (so the argument only has Anger as a lasting consequence, but the superhero fight can cause Injury).  So the game can handle soapy melodrama in a mechanically interesting way, but it's not limited to just that; it seems well-suited for any setup where the story is driven more by struggles between characters than by pursuit of a specific goal ("destroy the One Ring", "steal the classified data", etc).  The other really interesting bit is that the only way to actually get your way against another character is if they choose to give in and let you have your way; going to dice means they may regret resisting you (i.e., gain Stress), but the dice do not actually ensure the winner gets his way.  I'm still chewing over the implications of this, but it's a pretty interesting way of doing things.  <br/><br/>On top of all this, the game seems to have a lot of influence from FATE (all disads are basically self-compels, and there is something very very similar to a FATE point economy) and Burning Wheel (each character has ratings in Values like Truth, Justice, Glory, etc, as well as a relationship rating with all the other PCs, and you define each with a short statement like "Clark is an idiot" or "Power corrupts", that both informs how your character behaves, and gives them extra benefits if they ACT AGAINST those beliefs and later change them to match their new perspective).<br/><br/>So anyway, you can make your own characters (it uses a pretty neat Lifepath system), but the example of character creation and sample PCs are Clark, Lois, Oliver, Chloe, Tess, and Zod.  This is actually kind of brilliant for demonstrating the range of drama the game handles, from simple bickering, to love triangles, to full-on supervillainy, as well as giving the non-powered characters as much to do as the supers.  Almost half the book is writeups of various guest characters that have appeared, along with detailed summaries of the first nine seasons.<br/><br/>Nobody in my group is actually a fan of the show, so we've been doing other settings. I've done character creation for an X-Men spinoff, Heroes/Aberrant-style "supers without superhero tropes", and Romero-style living dead (haven't gotten to actual play on this one, but I think it would work amazingly well, since zombies are only ever the proximate cause of death in those flicks, the REAL danger is the stupid things your fellow survivors do.  Plus, it's easy to keep playing if you go zombie, just pick up some super-Abilities to represent zombieness and change all your Drive statements to involve eating your fellows.  No wonder it's always your dead mother/brother/lover that gets you-- their Relationship die is huge!), and I think it would do Amber pretty well too.  One of my players is making noises about using it for some kind of Deep Space Nine/Babylon 5 riff.  It's actually kind of habit-forming to look at various series and pick out who's a PC and who's just a supporting NPC (like, Doctor Doom is TOTALLY a PC in the Fantastic Four game).<br/><br/>If you're a story-game/indie-game fan AND a fan of the show, I suggest you buy it right now, I can't imagine you'd be disappointed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291839/#Comment_291839" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-06T19:46:51+00:00" title="September  6, 2010  7:46PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 6, 2010 8:00PM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite><br/><br/>This finally got my interest in Smallville piqued.

The characters' emotional states, beliefs, and relationships with each other are both the foundation of every roll you make, and mechanically incentivized to be challenged and rewritten.  And this is true for every character-- so if you want someone else to do something, they need to decide whether or not they'll give it to you, and whether or not they'll have to change themselves to do it.  Plus you can shoot lasers out of your eyes if you want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291973/#Comment_291973" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-07T10:38:38+00:00" title="September  7, 2010 10:38AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joe McGuffin</cite>The other really interesting bit is that the only way to actually get your way against another character is if they choose to give in and let you have your way; going to dice means they may regret resisting you (i.e., gain Stress), but the dice do not actually ensure the winner gets his way.</blockquote>\nHuh! that sounds like straight up <i>In A Wicked Age</i> "negotiating with a stick".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291991/#Comment_291991" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-07T11:05:30+00:00" title="September  7, 2010 11:05AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 7, 2010 11:05AM by JDCorley.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is a bit similar, yeah.<br/><br/>The core mechanic of the game is: "roll at least 2 dice, keep and add together the 2 highest".<br/><br/>The 2 dice you always get to roll are your ratings in a Value (Duty, Justice, etc.) and a Relationship.  Even if it's just "I have to prove myself to my friend" or "I have to show my rival I'm not what he thinks I am". (Other dice can come from superpowers or traits or gear or the situation or whatever.)<br/><br/>The scenario creation rules are very simple: target a relationship between two characters by creating an NPC whose actions exacerbate the differences, or challenge the nature, of that relationship. Then work out why that NPC would do those actions. Repeat, trying to minimize actors by reusing them in different parts of the scenario. When you can leverage everyone at the table, your scenario is ready.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
