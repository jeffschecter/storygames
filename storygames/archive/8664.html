I'm imagining that it's a pre-D&amp;D thing, prevalent in certain kinds of campaign-based wargames, with units getting better over time.  Perhaps it originated as pools of resource points that could be used to purchase or upgrade units and equipment, which eventually got applied to updating the actual abilities of individual pieces?<br/><br/>Anybody got real info, not just speculation?

So if you wanted "level 2 pike" or whatever there would have to be a physical way to show that, and I've never heard of anything like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191780/#Comment_191780" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-10T00:56:33+00:00" title="February 10, 2009 12:56AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How did Warhammer handle lizard men with poisoned spears and arrows?

Not even the majority of it, I'd venture to say. "traditional" wargaming grognards play on hex maps with square cardstock chits with lots of small numbers on them... and they would allow upgraded units simply by swapping the chits for those with bigger numbers on them.<br/><br/>Re: warhammer. If the poisoned arrows are not the standard for that unit (in which case you don't need to differentiate), then they probably are some kind of magic item/upgrade that is simply written down on the army list. And, mind you, Warhammer hardly qualifies at all as wargame, if you ask the grognards, let alone a traditional one <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191789/#Comment_191789" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-10T02:07:34+00:00" title="February 10, 2009  2:07AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Arneson" rel="nofollow">Dave Arneson</a> used XP in Blackmoor, at least.

In fact, I'm imagining that XP was basically an innovation that allowed you to play again with the same figures and have it still be interesting, because things would have changed without you having to change your entire army around. Gorkamorka did this, speaking of GW, by changing the army list constantly, but I imagine it has predecessors. I might try to hit up OldGeezer and see if he knows what Dave's inspiration was.<br/><br/><b>Matthijs:</b> From poking around a bit, it looks like you're right about Dave being the first one to use both XP and experience levels in proto-RPGs. That may be good enough for my purposes, actually.  Thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
