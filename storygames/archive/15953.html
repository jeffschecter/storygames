My name's Joachim, or just Joe.  I've been into tabletop RPGs since I was 16.  I was interested in them as early as 12, but it was all rather foreign and beyond me at that point, and I didn't know anybody else who could guide me into the scene, so I had to make do with computer games and playing pretend (which is, really, the purest form of RPG, some might say).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI've also been into music my whole life, starting on the drums at the age of 6, and progressing to piano and guitar, and for the past 6 years, electronic music performance and production has been my thing.  So it was a natural step for me to combine the two big creative impulses in my life, with this result:  http://soundcloud.com/rpgambience    So if anybody is interested in some music or location soundbeds, or really anything audio, feel free to drop me a line!  I work for free, as a token of gratitude and good faith to those online communities that have supported (and continue to support) me in my life as a gamer.  Also, it's just something I love doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSystems I've played or tried out are:  WoD, AD&amp;D, Kobolds Ate My Baby, Conan, and D20 Modern.  I've also done a ton of freeform play-by-post writing, and that's really what turned me into a tabletop gamer.  I've read a ton of pdfs and books for other games, but haven't managed to get a group in gear for them yet.  Things on the to-do list are:  ORE, Swashbuckler, Heavy Gear, Risus, Everway, The Pool, and many more.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've also been working on my own little truculent ogre of a homebrew project for the past year and a half ish.  You can find some scruffy rough drafts and half-ideas up here:  http://rubbermancer.wordpress.com/the-broken-realms/<br/>\n<br/>\nAaaand that's me in a nutshell!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362916/#Comment_362916" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-27T10:11:25+00:00" title="February 27, 2012 10:11AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Welcome, Joachim!<br/><br/>Your audio stuff is really interesting to me and I'll definitely check it out.

I hope we see some updates on that one soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nJenskot, a location soundbed (or "soundscape") is an audio track of ambiance, designed to simulate the sound of a place, real or imagined.  It's great having the sound of an in-world area on the speakers in the background at the gaming table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363096/#Comment_363096" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-27T16:26:49+00:00" title="February 27, 2012  4:26PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rubbermancer</cite>Apropos, a game I forgot to mention in my list is The Wildlings.
