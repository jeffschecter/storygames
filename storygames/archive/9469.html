I've been reading the threads here and elsewhere on the conflict mechanics, but I'm still a little stuck on how it would play out for social conflicts.  It sounds like all attempts at convincing another player of anything against his or her will has to be encoded in physical acts (even if it's just a speech) which can be countered by other physical acts.  If I win, I haven't necessarily convinced you.  I can injure or exhaust you, with color text as to what the injury or exhaustion looked like. Alternatively, we can agree on some concession.  Does the concession have to be a physical thing, or can the concession include being convinced (as opposed to behaving like you've been convinced)?  It sounds like forcing a change to a character's inner life may not be acceptable, even as a concession.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209813/#Comment_209813" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-01T09:43:47+00:00" title="June  1, 2009  9:43AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played four sessions, and we wrestled with this issue.  In the end, concessions can be anything, even non-physical, as long as they are immediate.  "I am convinced" is not so good, because the character is free to change their mind at any time.  Same goes for promises.  But you can persuade the other person to take immediate action.  We had social conflicts in front of crowds that ended with the concession of the losing character publicly declaring their support for the new king then and there.  So, IME, concessions work best when they are actions right in that moment, not things in the future or changes in belief or attitude.  They can also work for follow up scenes: "go and confront my rival" can work as immediate enough, because that can start off the next scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209822/#Comment_209822" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-01T10:14:41+00:00" title="June  1, 2009 10:14AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2009 10:15AM by Jesse.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is how I do it which may or may not be the same as the way Vincent does it.<br/><br/>1) There are no Persuasion mechanics in IAWA.  That is not the same as there are no Social Conflict mechanics.  So long as there is an honest attempt to convince someone of something on the merits of the discussion at hand, no dice.  Period.  You can't reason or argue with someone via the dice in IAWA.<br/><br/>2) I use the concept of "The Weapon."  As soon as someone uses a weapon we go to dice.  There are tons and tons of social weapons.  A social weapon comes into play when someone steps outside the discussion at hand to try and force you to do what they want.  That's what the whole "enflames mens passions" example in the text is all about.  Sorcery is being used to force someone's behavior.  Bribery and threats are also weapons.<br/><br/>3) When negotiating at the end of the conflict "I convince you" is a weak negotiation because they can just change their minds immediately.  Instead it should be "I convince you and you do THIS about it."  Where THIS is something they can do immediately as their very next scene or action.  If it's a vague promise about a future event they can change their minds about that to but they can't get out of IMMEDIATE consequences that they agree to.<br/><br/>Does that help?<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209826/#Comment_209826" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-01T10:21:25+00:00" title="June  1, 2009 10:21AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If Jesse and Christian agree, it must be true. <br/><br/>(Or, yes to what they said.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209839/#Comment_209839" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-01T10:55:08+00:00" title="June  1, 2009 10:55AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2009 10:55AM by John_Harper.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You don't go to dice when people are "just talking" in the same way you don't go to dice when people are "just shoving each other back and forth." It's not social vs. physical that is the distinction. It's <b>action</b> that matters.<br/><br/>To go to dice, someone has to take <i>concrete action</i> that meets these criteria:<br/>1. It could conceivably result in injury or exhaustion.<br/>2. Someone else can and would interfere with the action.<br/><br/>That's it. Physical, social, spiritual, whatever... doesn't matter as long as it fits the criteria.<br/><br/>Another good shorthand is: you go to dice when someone stops caring about the other person's freedom of action. When you do something that the other person doesn't want you to do, but you carry on anyway. I think this helps clear up the false physical vs. social dichotomy. Imagine someone who wants to get beaten up out of guilt. So he goes and confesses his crime to someone violent, and that violent person holds the guilty person down and pounds their face in. No one interferes with the face-pounding, and no dice are rolled, even though it's physical action and harm. No fictional characters objected to it, so no dice.<br/><br/>Now imagine the same guilty person who desperately wants forgiveness instead of a face pounding. So he goes to his wife, and, through concrete action, he <i>forces</i> her to forgive him. Nothing physical happens, but it's force and action nonetheless. I'm sure you've been in plenty of situations where someone forced you without punching you in the face. The wife doesn't want to forgive the crime, but, the guilty husband forces the issue to the breaking point, and the dice come out and decide things.<br/><br/>At the end of an action sequence, the loser gets injured or exhausted, or you negotiate. The wife can hold fast and take exhaustion and refuse to forgive, of course. But these are not "conflicts" remember. It's not "roll and done" like a lot of indie games. You can always just go right into another action sequence if you don't get what you want (and you usually should). The guilty husband can continue to apply force (now going against the wife's reduced dice). How far will he go? Will she ever relent and just tell him what he wants to hear? And there's your non-physical social struggle, with dice, right there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209929/#Comment_209929" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-01T18:49:12+00:00" title="June  1, 2009  6:49PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, folks, this clarifies it for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209949/#Comment_209949" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-01T21:27:27+00:00" title="June  1, 2009  9:27PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We go to dice whenever somebody at the table roars: "<b>Oh, no, you fucking don't!!!</b>" at the top of their lungs.<br/>It's a ritual phrase.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210023/#Comment_210023" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-02T09:53:05+00:00" title="June  2, 2009  9:53AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>Now imagine the same guilty person who desperately wants forgiveness instead of a face pounding.

I can't. This is your fault, you brought this on yourself." She goes to leave the room, her hands trembling a little. (She doesn't give, but he does have advantage) <br/><br/>They pick up and roll, he gets a 5+6 = 11, 4 and she gets a 7, 5. Again, he says: <br/><br/>"But do you hate me so much you want me to die?

Read the conversation Conan has with Valeria in the opening section. Conan's like, I totally want to fuck this woman and I totally want her to do what I say, but, well, fuck it, I'm not going to make her to.<br/><br/>If you roll dice, you're no longer trying to convince someone to do something, you're trying to make them do it. Shahu Seen isn't trying to convince Mekha to go for Tajie, he's trying to MAKE him go for Tajie.<br/><br/>So: if you want someone to do something, tell them your reasons. Maybe they'll do it, maybe they won't. But - while you're leaving it up to them, don't roll dice.<br/><br/>Rolling dice means that you don't care anymore what they want to do, or whether you've convinced them, or anything like that. It means you're holding the gun to their head and telling them what to do (whatever the gun happens to be).<br/><br/>Make sense?<br/><br/>-Vincent<br/></blockquote>\nAnd then Ryan said:\n<blockquote><br/>I say "Mehka, playing on her inflamed lust, seduces Tajie and brings her to bed with him." despite the fact I know Tajie wants to do no such thing.  Since Tajie says "no way" we go to dice.  As a result of the dice I get a stick with which I can negotiate - where I can say "Tajie, come to bed with me or I'm going to injure/exhaust you."<br/><br/>Paradoxically, you go to dice to make people do stuff, but winning doesn't make them do stuff - the negotiating does.  So if I win Tajie comes to bed with Mehka only if Tajie prefers that to being exhausted/injured.<br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210070/#Comment_210070" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-02T14:32:54+00:00" title="June  2, 2009  2:32PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 2, 2009 2:37PM by Brand_Robins.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vincent hates me.
