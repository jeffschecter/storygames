If you haven't heard of it, that's cool, I've been working on it for ages and all the buzz has pretty much died down at this point. It's a universal, trait-based rpg in the HeroQuest mould with a heavy focus on collaborative worldbuilding, genre emulation, player empowerment, and other storygame stuff.  You can read more about it <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=337595" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3247&amp;page=1#Item_0" rel="nofollow">here</a><br/><br/>Here's the thing though: you must be British. I had been working with an American editor and, though he was very good, I think that the language barrier proved a bit bigger than either of us had expected. I mean, my book's not written in cockney rhyming slang or anything, but there were enough slight differences that we weren't always on the same page about things. I want to see how it works with someone closer to my linguistic wavelength, as it were.<br/><br/>So... any takers?<br/><br/>Mark                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309573/#Comment_309573" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T14:00:39+00:00" title="January 25, 2011  2:00PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 25, 2011 2:00PM by Graham.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know someone who's looking for editing work.

Part of the skill set is working within an author's voice and reinforcing that, not wrenching it to some other dialect. Also, British English really isn't all that different (slang notwithstanding); at least it didn't seem to me to be after a year there in college (studying English and Philosophy--and the credits transferred to my English degree from an American university.

I'd be happy to recommend him to other people if the circumstances came up, but I don't think I'm going to out him in this thread given the above comments. <br/><br/>It may well be that this whole language thing was a total red herring, and that the real problem was just stylistic differences or me being an uneditable jerk. We'll see!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
