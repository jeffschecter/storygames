What can you \u2013 mere animals \u2013 do?<br/>Why, lots! Shadow the cat knows where the Master was captured. Reek the ferret is a contortionist and has a magic twig! Penny the falcon is fearless, while Midnight, the master\u2019s steed, has strength and speed aplenty. Isabelle the bloodhound can track a scent anywhere.Barney is a strong, loyal, agile dog for whom most obstacles prove mere annoyances. Bandit the \u2018coon is clever with his paws \u2013 very clever. And Anaxagoras the owl is in training to be a wizard!<br/>The player characters are animals!<br/><br/><br/>I would like to take an approach of a much more  SATIRE  style that you can see in stories like:  Watership Down (book/animation), Plague Dogs (book/animation), We3 (comic), and the classic Animal Farm (book).<br/><br/>Below are some notes on the original adventure I will be using as a base for the campaign start... the short adventure HOOK...  But I'd like to use ideas from those sources for a more  "ORWELLIAN"  style role-play and world approach.<br/><br/><br/>ANIMAL FARM<br/>The original commandments are:<br/>Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.<br/>Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.<br/>No animal shall wear clothes.<br/>No animal shall sleep in a bed. (No animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets.)<br/>No animal shall drink alcohol. (No animal shall drink alcohol to excess.)<br/>No animal shall kill any other animal. (No animal shall kill any other animal without cause.)<br/>All animals are equal.<br/><br/>Eventually, these are replaced with the maxims, <br/>"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others"<br/>and "Four legs good, two legs better!" <br/>as the pigs become more human. This is an ironic twist to the original purpose of the Seven Commandments, which were supposed to keep order within Animal Farm by uniting the animals together against the humans and preventing animals from following the humans' evil habits. Through the revision of the commandments, Orwell demonstrates how simply political dogma can be turned into malleable propaganda. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>a reviewer noted:<br/>Were this written for typical humanoid PCs, it would be a forgettable dungeon crawl: a fine way to spend a gaming session, but hardly a campaign highlight. But with the animal PCs -- a raccoon, a peregrine falcon, a ferret, two dogs, a cat, an owl and a horse -- it becomes something different. Not necessarily superior, but certainly much more challenging and entertaining. After all, what's simple for human hands to accomplish can present a formidable challenge to even the smartest cat. The adventure recommends that the Master's influence allow the animals to speak to each other, which allows them to brainstorm without an added language barrier.<br/><br/>It all starts when the Master, a mage in the service of the Free Rangers of Amberland, leaves camp to apprehend a man who has been doing bad things with magic. An hour or so later, Shadow the cat gets a distress call from the Master. Isabelle the bloodhound picks up his scent trail, and the search and rescue is on.<br/><br/>While logical, the scent trail makes the adventure too linear. The animals don't have to work to find the Master, and they aren't likely to go down an alternate path just to see what else might be around. (OK, so Reek Havoc the ferret did during my playtest. He's an exception.) The challenges come in the form of the encounters on the way.<br/><br/>Most of the encounters are monsters created by the evil sorcerer. Some are hostile, some neutral or potentially friendly. With the hostile creatures, Midnight the horse has the potential to make any combat extremely short, with a 9 damage factor to trample. Nothing in the game can survive a direct hit. He's a big horse with steel shoes, so it's as logical as the scent trail, but the net result was a few lucky rolls ending most of the combats, before any PC got hurt. Combat was so skewed in favor of the PCs that I began to wonder if the dice were loaded. Had it been part of an ongoing campaign, I'd probably have cheated in the monsters' favor, or at least made them more resistant to damage.<br/><br/>The biggest challenges to the animals would be trivial to a group of humans. For example, a locked door. These situations are where Another Fine Mess did its best job pointing out the animals' weaknesses. There are ways around all of these situations, but the bulk of the party's time was spent on them.<br/><br/>Also, each has the Master listed under Gifts, but each has a different description of him from the animal's point of view. Example: the ferret thinks of the Master as "person with pockets," while the owl (who believes himself the Master's apprentice) describes him as "Homo Sapiens Thaumaturgist." If this is the kind of quality we can expect from Animal Companions when it ships, that will be a must-buy.<br/><br/>These notes do admit that the adventure is very linear as it stands.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/summerdown" title="summerdown"><img alt="summerdown" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/summerdown">summerdown</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424282/#Comment_424282" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-16T11:07:49+00:00" title="November 16, 2013 11:07AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 16, 2013 11:09AM by summerdown.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you seen John Wick's game <a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/14/14146.phtml" rel="nofollow">Cat</a>?<br/><br/>It is similar to the idea of playing an animal companion, in that PCs are cats, out to save their human companions from bad dreams.

The thing to remember is that, as mentioned in the review, the interesting bits are when the players get to act very much like animals and have to use animal skills/reasoning to get past problems. One of the reasons I mention GSS is that not only is this heavily mirrored but also the split within the animals, in Another Fine Mess the ferret, raccoon and dogs are very impetious and young while the other animals are more studied and 'adult' which often leads to a split in play. Similarly in GSS Fox and Cat characters often end up split from Tanuki, Bird or Rabbit characters as they suggest very different methods of characterisation.<br/><br/>With the less linear stuff that I wrote for AFM (although still quite linear, you need very few encouters to fill a one shot with this style of play satisfactorily and with the need to confront the animals with unique problems a degree of 'railroading' works well) the group very often split in these groupings of maturity. <br/><br/>I've not tried making it more serious, I don't know if looking at something like Mouseguard might not be the better option there. It takes very little prompting (read, 'none') to get the players to be acting in a quite fun and juvinile fashion in games like this and getting them to treat it as a serious thing may actually be a bit of a task, I'm not sure you'd get more by trying to run Rabbits within a Watership Down setting than if you were just running humans in a Watership Down style set up. Considering we're playing made up people already the books need to use animals to analogue humans may be somewhat redundant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424410/#Comment_424410" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-18T20:06:13+00:00" title="November 18, 2013  8:06PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            nerdwerds made a really excellent playbook for Apocalypse World where you play a talking* dog with an NPC "owner".
