Portal, after all, is a physics-based first person puzzle game. It has a nifty story attached to it, yes, but the story isn't what the game's mainly about. It's about that awesome feeling of flying/falling through the air and figuring out awesome puzzles and getting the timing right and all that stuff which a story game can't replicate.<br/><br/>Still, <a href="http://io9.com/5806790/in-the-portal-fan-movie-outside-aperture-its-cake-time" rel="nofollow">as you can see in this fan movie</a>, it's still something that can be incorporated into a story (a movie in this case), even if not very centrally -- that movie is really more about the cake than the portals, but the portals are in it at least. <br/><br/>So if Valve contacted you and said, "Make us a Portal tabletop RPG!" What would you say to them? If you'd say, "okay!" then where would you start in trying to make it work?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326999/#Comment_326999" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-31T02:30:46+00:00" title="May 31, 2011  2:30AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2011 2:31AM by TylerT.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i would make a dexterity board game based on portal, but it would require real portals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327001/#Comment_327001" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-31T03:14:54+00:00" title="May 31, 2011  3:14AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My approach would be to intersperse role play with cooperative puzzle solving board game style play a choose your own adventure style narrative.

A tactial RPG/board game hybrid with way too much papercraft used to build a modular 3D proving grounds.  The game would have a simple turn based vector movement system for when players go airborne.  There might even be flight stands if it turns out that serious hang time is possible.  The opponents would be androids that have pre-programed behaviors (such as patrolling) as part of the puzzle building level design.  The game could be played solo, co-op, or in versus mode and would probably be GM-less as long as you run the canned scenarios.<br/><br/>In my mind's eye, the shooting system would use templates and overlays.  Templates would be grid pictures of targets at point blank/short/medium/long range from various angles with overlays for walls and portals that would provide cover.   [A bit like the Bounty Hunter: Shoot out at the Saloon picture books when played in advanced mode.]<br/><br/>Why a shooty game for Portal?  Well, you can't duplicate the detailed physics except at a coarse level, but you still want to work with portals.  So, besides the puzzles you provide the simulated complexity of a combat system.<br/><br/>I mentioned GM-less, but I could also imagine a player taking on the role of GLaDiUS, the live fire version of GLaDOS.  They would handle all the androids, moving platforms, and other environmental items.

You're just about the only human in sight, you aren't particularly good at anything besides, maybe, jumping and running, and you have this portal gun. You're mainly interacting with robots, and they respond to pre-listed directives and to programming, not to persuasion or feeling. Well, maybe the Cube responds to feelings; I've only played PORTAL in a demo at a Best Buy, so I don't know the ins and outs of the plot. <br/><br/>It does sound like lots of quick, one-shot maps are in order, and mechanics centering around aiming correctly and quick reflexes would be pretty relevant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327050/#Comment_327050" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-31T11:12:31+00:00" title="May 31, 2011 11:12AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Virginia</cite> mechanics centering around aiming correctly and quick reflexes would be pretty relevant.</blockquote>\nPortal's not really about quick aiming and reflexes.  It's not a FPS.  It's a puzzle game disguised as a FPS.  But it's primarily about figuring out where to place portals and how to flips switches and what this button does.  And only rarely does the puzzle really need some quick, careful aiming.<br/><br/><br/>And the robots are more human than you may expect if you haven't played it.  The plot of Portal 2 largely revolves around how you hurt GLaDOS's feelings at the end of Portal 1 (when you murdered her).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327056/#Comment_327056" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-31T11:31:09+00:00" title="May 31, 2011 11:31AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mr. Teapot</cite>*That's right: Weighted companion Cube as player character.</blockquote>\nLOL!

Some parts of Portal 2 (Cave Johnson, the co-op plot, etc) suggest that there a lot of other stories to tell in the setting if you expand beyond Chell/GLaDOS.

I'm really inspired by the idea of portals as a narrative mechanic instead of a puzzle mechanic. I'd see it together with other kinds of weird science fiction also -- not just portals, as you find in the game -- and I wonder what other sorts of magic-like science fiction tricks might fit well with it.<br><br>Limiting portals as a narrative device here would be just as important as limiting them in the game environment. Just as there are some surfaces that portals don't work on in the game, there would have to be situations they don't work in the fiction as well. They'd have to have a different logic to them, though, not just "surface A works but surface B doesn't." Say, for instance that portals could only work on flat surfaces, or if the fiery stuff around the edges of the portals really was a fire, so that portals could only work on flammable surfaces. Either of these would make portals extremely useful to characters in some situations but useless in others, and might help preserve niche protection for other characters with other powers.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327502/#Comment_327502" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-02T08:09:28+00:00" title="June  2, 2011  8:09AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: whiteknife</cite>I would play Portal using Paranoia.
