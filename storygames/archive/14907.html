I was intrigued enough to run a session using a setting hack of my own. Here are some thoughts after our first session yesterday:<br/><br/><b>PCs:</b><br/><br/>Skipper: LT JG (Lieutenant Junior Grade) Nanney, an enthusiastic 20-year old officer who traveled all the way from Virginia through the Panama Canal and across the Pacific Ocean to the Solomon Islands with his brand-new PT boat. Quite a scrawny guy who did not initially instill confidence in his men. But he knew his tactics. His secret was that he was quite a boxer growing up in St. Louis. This was his first command.<br/><br/>Gunner Mate: CPO (Chief Petty Officer--senior NCO) Burns was a tough and gutsy Irishman who had been in the Navy for awhile and didn't take lightly to the snot-nosed Nanney in command. Everyone around the PT boat base on Mather's Island knew he was the true leader. Burns was from the Northeast, and secretly had wanted to be a priest but joined the Navy instead.<br/><br/>Quartermaster: QM/3 (low-grade rank) "Manny" Samartino. A scrappy young guy from Brooklyn. Always seemed to have luck on his side, and was hell on the 20mm cannon. Had the ability to "acquire" the right thing at the right time. His secret was that no one knew he was a petty criminal back in NY.<br/><br/><br/><b>AP:</b><br/><br/>It's the summer of 1942 and the Allies are on the run in the South Pacific. The skies swarm with Japanese Zeros and the Imperial Japanese Navy is following up from their successful attacks on Pearl Harbor, The Philippines, and Bataan.<br/><br/>The PCs boat (PT-89) and PT-107 (commanded by the feckless NPC Ensign Clayton) left their base on tiny Mather's Island at dusk and traveled several hours up the island chain to drop off a 40-man Marine Raider detachment, whose mission was to destroy Japanese fuel supplies on Nissan Island and extract out in plenty of time to get back before first light.<br/><br/>But after the insertion, Clayton got too close to the reefs and grounded his boat. After a command altercation between the rookie skipper Nanney and the "seen it all" Chief Petty Officer Burns, LT Nanney was finally able to pull them off. But this did severe damage to the hull and the '107 started taking on water. Manny swam over and was able to jury-rig a fix using their refrigerator!<br/><br/>While this was happening, the crew was watching firefights happening on the island, presumably between the Marines and the Japanese. But far short of the Marine's objective. They watched as the Marine's fired off a green flare ("mission accomplished, moving to the extraction point") only to be followed 30 secs later by the red flare ("extract us here, NOW!").<br/><br/>The two PT boats moved in to support the Marines and try to get them out. They were attacked not only by the Japanese on shore, but by two approaching Japanese destroyers. PT-89 managed to save what was left of the Marines by firing a 2,600 pound torpedo into the beach and destroying most of the Japanese, who were closing in on the last 15 surviving Marines. Burns made two runs in a Zodiac boat to bring the Marines back on-board. <br/><br/>It was starting to get light, and the boats would be easy targets for Japanese planes. But first they had to escape the destroyers who were on their tail. The shot-up PT-89 was trailing behind and facing four Japanese torpedoes, when Manny dropped depth charges. He timed them to sink under Clayton's PT-89 as he passed over, and explode in front of the torpedoes which put them off-target and saved Clayton's bacon.<br/><br/>When it got light, two Japanese "Val" dive bombers attacked from a clear blue sky. PT-89 shot down one, but the second scored a near-miss before turning for home. <br/><br/>The destroyers were still coming, but the skipper managed to call in a big favor from the Marine air commander and a flight of Dauntless dive bombers appeared on the horizon, attacking the destroyers. The '89 and '107 used the confusion of battle to escape around the far side of the island. They found a blind spot were they could camouflage their boats and wait it out until darkness.<br/><br/>==<br/><br/><b>Stuff We Liked:</b><br/><br/>Overall we had a lot of fun with this first session. The PT boat and South Pacific setting seemed like a nice fit for the rules. And the players really liked the snowballing of moves, especially when rolling 7-9. It much have been an interesting experience serving on such a fast and heavily-armed boat that was yet facing enemies who were almost always either airborne or better armed then they were!<br/><br/>Kudos to John and Paul for the work they've done on The Regiment so far. Personally I can't wait to see more!<br/><br/><br/><b>MC Thoughts:</b><br/><br/>I had prepared fronts, custom character moves, a few custom MC moves, a countdown clock for the mission, and a PT boat playbook so they could pick strengths and a vulnerability for their boat. <br/><br/>The PC names I got from a list of actual PT crew members who had died in battle. And since hometowns and regional cultures were so important to men thrown together in the military back then, I had each player pick a region of the US for their crewman's hometown. That added to the depth of their character backgrounds.<br/><br/>I also printed out small B&amp;W photos of a bunch of actual US Navy sailors. The players really enjoyed selecting one to cut out and tape to their 3x5 name card in front of them on the table. I stole this idea from Matt Klien when he did it for A Taste for Murder last year.<br/><br/>One more thing I added during chargen was to ask each player one secret about their character that the other men didn't necessarily know. They came up with some cool stuff that I put in my pocket for later.<br/><br/>One of the coolest moments for me was when the gunner on the rear-facing 20mm cannon got killed by Japanese fire. Manny was feeding him ammo and was forced to pitch the dead body out of the way to continue firing. I realized that we hadn't said a single word about the 9 NPC sailors on the boat. So I asked the player to say a few words about the dead sailor from Manny's viewpoint. It was a poignant moment during a stressful battle.<br/><br/>So I like the concept that NPCs don't really exist to the story until they do something or they get killed.<br/><br/><br/><b>Questions/Concerns:</b><br/><br/>1. Experience was accumulating too fast. All three players either made two improvements, or got very close. This felt like too much for a 4-hour session. Five exp per improvement seems fine, but the play books say to mark XP when:<br/>-Take Harm<br/>-Miss a Roll<br/>-Hit w a 12+<br/>-Achieve Obj.<br/>-Reset Bond<br/>-Move Tells You<br/><br/>We assumed that stats should be marked and giving XP for rolling, as in AW and DW. Is this incorrect? We had several instances where players marked XP twice for the same roll (marked stat + miss). And when rolling 'Are You Crazy?' they could have even marked XP three times.<br/><br/>I'd hate to lose the marking of stats and gaining XP for them, as I've seen this drive some good player action. Especially between sessions. <br/><br/>My suggestion would be to simply eliminate XP for Missing a Roll. And probably for Taking Harm. Maybe increase the improvements to every 6 XP instead of 5 to account for the extra opportunities.<br/><br/>2. PC-to-PC actions were awkward. We had several instances where a PC was trying to order/influence/browbeat another PC. It was tough to deal with this without really interrupting the flow of the game to discuss the options. We ended up using Impose Your Will and Petition Up the Chain of Command, each once. But neither roll or resolution felt very satisfying.<br/><br/>3. Along the same lines as <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, there were chain-of-command issues that we didn't really have rules for. The scrub sailor got thrown off the bridge for doing something stupid. But was it cool for the same sailor to suggest a course of action to his skipper? And would an experienced Chief Petty Officer and his rookie skipper have almost come to blows over a disagreement that could cost two PT boat crews their lives? It was difficult to know how far we could push the concept that "PT boat crews were more informal than the regular Navy" before requiring a dice roll. I could see something similar happening with a special operations force or mercenary group in The Regiment.<br/><br/>4. We had a few questions about internal vs external conflicts. In AW, the threats (in our small experience) tend to be mostly internal. Or they are external threats that can cause internal upheaval. But with the chain-of-command, there is likely not going to be open warfare amongst the crew. And they are up against a definitely enemy (the Japanese) who require their undivided attention. Should we be playing any differently knowing this? Should I as the MC be running any differently?<br/><br/>5. I experimented with the Engagement Moves a few times, but since they exist only as a table on the 'Elements of Warfare' playbook, there is a lot of guesswork I needed to make. Should these be called for by the MC as meta-conflicts? Is this something that would occur mostly at the start of the mission or game session? Or is it cool to call for one during a session when circumstances change?<br/><br/>6. We wondered about personal vs. ship injury. Personally, I kind of hand-waved harm this first session while I felt out the other rules and how they differed from AW and DW. But when the characters are typically on their PT boat, it's difficult to know when the enemy should be taking harm against the boat as opposed to one or more PCs (or NPCs). Just wanted to see a little guidance there.<br/><br/>==<br/><br/>Would love to get comments and feedback, especially from those who have played The Regiment or have a lot of AW experience.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul" title="Irminsul"><img alt="Irminsul" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul">Irminsul</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338743/#Comment_338743" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-14T15:41:46+00:00" title="August 14, 2011  3:41PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Caesar_X</cite>We assumed that stats should be marked and giving XP for rolling, as in AW and DW.

I had some issues around this in our West Virginia Resistance game as well and I'm trying to figure it out. <br/><br/>In AW "moves snowball" means that your interpersonal relationships get more-and-more fraught, complicated, or compromised. Mechanically, these relationships are made up of Hx, holds, and promises waiting to be broken. These relationships comprise a big part of what you do in AW and are also a big part of what the game is about.<br/><br/>But in TR, "moves snowball" means that your tactical situation becomes more desperate, critical, or dangerous. The soldiers\u2019 personal relationships are always peripheral to the fact that they're in immanent danger of death. Mechanically, relationships are made up of bonds and the chain of command. Note, however, that you can change a bond in TR at any time (and you should do it often). Adding a bond is the primary social move in TR. <br/><br/>All this means that interpersonal relationships are dominated by three things: 1) someone giving orders and someone following them or not 2) soldiers becoming closer to one another in battle 3) seeing the effect of war on your friends and reacting to it. So I think interpersonal relationships are not so much what you "do" in RT, but still very much part of what the game is about.<br/><br/>So here's how I THINK it's supposed to work in play, though I'm not 100% sure I've got it yet.<br/><br/>Some interpersonal stuff is covered by moves, but note those moves tend to snowball in the direction of battle. I struggled with this in the WV game, but we worked it out as follows:<br/><br/>Karen's partisans are trying to get aboard the troop train (civilian operated). I want this to be some kind of seduce move to trick the guards, but there's no such move. Eventually we figure out it's "recon/infil". This is, after all, a military operation. Their success means they get picked up by the civilian engine crew and given lunch.<br/><br/>Later, Karen decides she wants to get the crew to give them control of the engine. Again, there's no convincing. If the crew were part of the resistance, Karen could order them, but they're not. We decide they're close enough to partisans to count, so this is "petition the partisans for help". On a 7-9 someone is exposed to danger, and the scene ends with the engineer and crew being shot and tossed from the train by Karen's team. War is ugly.<br/><br/>Now Karen wants to walk back through the troop car and possibly the officer car to scout out the ammo car. There's no move for trying to bluff your way past the guards. This is obviously "Are you Crazy?" On the failed roll, the Federal sergeant decides that all locals are partisans and he's going to shoot Karen in cold blood. The rest of her team fill the sergeant full of holes, and now it's a firefight: Karen's three-person team against an entire platoon on a train.<br/><br/>I think that was the only really failed roll in the game. Later Ben's sniper will take out the machine gun on the train as Karen's team blows the engine and escape, bloodied into the woods. As the troops disembark, Jonathan's team of backwoods riflemen pin them down in a defensive position in and under the boxcars. Ben's sniper takes out the commanding officer and HMG while Karen's team returns from the woods and toss grenades into the ammo car (!!!!). The follow up by rolling more grenades under the boxcars from behind the train, decimating the troops pinned under there.<br/><br/>The Union Brotherhood captured the survivors while taking only medium casualties themselves, though a recon element did escape back down the mountain to report the failure.<br/><br/>I think that you do have to take leeway wherever you find it. With your game it was the informality of the PT boat crews. In ours it was the idea that rangers operate independent of the chain of command, which allowed our teams to make their own battlefield plans even though none of them was an officer.<br/><br/><b>edit</b>: reading back through your post, I'm not sure I'm even addressing your issues, so maybe I'm just flailing around here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338937/#Comment_338937" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-15T14:52:48+00:00" title="August 15, 2011  2:52PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tony dowler</cite><b>edit</b>: reading back through your post, I'm not sure I'm even addressing your issues, so maybe I'm just flailing around here.</blockquote>\nQuite the contrary, Tony.
