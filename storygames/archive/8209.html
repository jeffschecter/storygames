I remember going to a friend's house and watching them play it, but quickly becoming bored by the repetitive combat and the lack of anything happening.  Definitely one of those games that's much more fun to play than watch.<br/><br/>And, as I'm playing this, I'm like... huh, hit points in this game are weird because attacks never miss, they just do a variable amount of damage.  However, the amount by which they vary (at least in the early game) isn't usually large enough to make gambling a key part of the strategy.  You can't try to squeak by enemies by hoping that they "roll low" on damage, so it's best to be overprepared and totally outclass your opponents.<br/><br/>Instead, hit points (of the enemies) are a timer for how long the fight lasts.  And the other hit points (your own) are a timer for how often you have to use your resources (potions, healing spells, etc.).  So it's not really a tactical game, much.  It's really a resource management game in the style of Nobilis or Marvel Universe or Mortal Coil.<br/><br/>And then I was like: missing totally sucks.  Why do most roleplaying games do the wiff thing at all?  Like, why don't attacks in D&amp;D4 ALWAYS HIT and then you just roll damage.  If that's too strong, then at least it seems like attacks should ALWAYS DO SOMETHING USEFUL even if that useful thing is not pushing the fight towards its conclusion by damaging the enemy.<br/><br/>So, like, Star Wars.  Luke, Han, and Leia are trying to escape some stormtroopers, who are firing at them.  The stormtroopers miss all over the place.  But their fire does one useful thing, right?  It pins the trio down to a location and creates a problem.  They need to get to the Falcon, but they're stuck here with these stormtroopers.  They can keep shooting troopers, but more keep coming.  The good guys are shooting the troopers too, though.  What useful thing does that do?  It keeps th troopers a fair distance away, to keep the group from being overrun while they figure out a solution.<br/><br/>What doesn't happen, in any of the media I think D&amp;D and most combat/adventure games are trying to emulate, is the characters trying something and having NOTHING HAPPEN.  Why in the world would you want that?  If you're gonna miss somebody, they should at least have to dive behind a table, changing the terrain a bit and maybe giving you an advantage.  In all cases, SOMETHING SHOULD HAPPEN.<br/><br/>Am I going crazy here?  Is there a good reason for designing static situations in games, where energy and resources (like combat turns) are spent on achieving nothing?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180766/#Comment_180766" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-29T12:17:33+00:00" title="November 29, 2008 12:17PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't find "miss nothing" so annoying when "thus there is another chance to suffer harm/see your goal destroyed/other side's goal achieved".<br/><br/>That said, I do like narrative games where "the fiction advances every round", IAWA some part of the challenge action does take place etc., Find Annalise - you're ver unlikely to end up with having a "nothing good and nothing bad" happens outcome and have to work very hard at it in fact.<br/><br/>The key on those points is the move from simulationist to narrative basis of resolution I think.  One can imagine simulating action where "he missed nothing happens" but narratively imagining a "scene" where "nothing happens that advances story or reveals character or somehow moves things" is more difficult.<br/><br/>That said, yup, 4e D&amp;D would be cool if "every action did something", "that melee attack missed you, as long as you say you moved back a square, or had to drop prone, or your sword or shield broke blocking it, or you used the chair and it was smashed".  Of course the designers did create lots of powers with "miss effects" already so in that case the wiff-disliking player can focus more on moving to selecting those powers.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180768/#Comment_180768" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-29T12:37:44+00:00" title="November 29, 2008 12:37PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Johnathan; <br/><br/>I won't ever sell you on "nothing happens", because I absolutely agree that "nothing happens" is either boring or frustrating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180773/#Comment_180773" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-29T12:58:40+00:00" title="November 29, 2008 12:58PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In traditional games the Star Wars situation would be modeled by the players taking cover, and the Storm Troopers missing because they're under cover. If they come out of cover, the modifiers that make the STs miss will go away, thus making them harder targets. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe whiff factor (whiff, in this post, as being defined as simply the random chance of missing, not as a result of particular choices made by the player or opposition) in games is annoying, I'll grant. That's why a lot of my efforts have moved toward every action doing something, or at least every "successful" attack, where it won't be totally negated by a more successful defense. <br/>\n<br/>\n...so basically, I won't sell you on nothing happening, either. The best I can say is that if you can succeed most of the time, the occasional whiff isn't too incredibly annoying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180774/#Comment_180774" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-29T13:06:56+00:00" title="November 29, 2008  1:06PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2008 1:07PM by JDCorley.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nothing happening is the entire basis for a whole segment of my games, which I call, collectively, my "Clerks" games, in which the whole game consists of the characters avoiding doing things and making snarky and nasty remarks about it.<br/><br/>Plus, you always should have nothing happen after you have something big happen or else nothing that happens is ever big.<br/><br/>It's not quite what you're asking for ("quite" here meaning "at all"), but there you go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180783/#Comment_180783" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-29T15:29:24+00:00" title="November 29, 2008  3:29PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2008 3:30PM by John_Harper.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan: Your post is full of truth.

When we played D&amp;D, a miss rarely meant nothing happening. It might have been "You miss, so the monster gets a turn" or "You fail to pick the lock and the guard comes closer".<br/><br/>2. When I played, a miss often led to colour narration: "The arrow flies past the ogre's head, enraging him still further". That narration didn't always stay as colour: "All right, if it's enraged, I'm going to get behind the pit and provoke it to charge at me."<br/><br/>3. A miss can mean "think of more options". "No, the lock's stuck fast. Think of another way in". It's a sort of "Deal with it" statement. Yeah, that's how the fiction is now, what are you going to do about it?<br/><br/>4. The more I play story games, the more I want rolls to be <i>about the thing we're doing</i>. You're trying to hack the computer (or, if you want to be conflict-resolutiony about it, you're trying to find out some information) and if the roll <i>fails</i>, I want that to <i>fail</i>. No "you succeed but narrate a disadvantage". No narrating flashbacks about your brother. You fail. Deal with it from there.<br/><br/>5. I also think it's important failure exists as a contrast to success.

Like maybe you stabbed your opponent's lover in the throat, but they were like, "Nice, now I don't have to kill that one meself."  But yeah, it can definitely suck if you just feel like your great idea is being rendered totally inefficacious.<br/><br/>On a related note, I sometimes have issues with randomly rolled levels of success or failure, as in Mountain Witch or Cold City, for the same reason.  As Levi notes above, failing big is often as exciting as succeeding big (because SOMETHING HAPPENS!).  But sometimes succeeding or failing by a smidgen is basically the same as whiffing.  There was all this excitement!  "I fucking stab him in the back!"  And then your Judas move glances off his armor, giving him a little scratch. Great.  It's like the system takes your creative input and turns it into suck.<br/><br/><b>Levi:</b> Losing big is cool, but I think there are more interesting ways to do that then whiffing, right?  Because failing a roll to hit isn't failing big, it's failing really, really small.<br/><br/><b>Shreyas:</b> That's an interesting point.  Then, in modern forms of D&amp;D, has the fiction become too coupled to the die rolls, instead of being more lose and allowing the mechanics to be a relatively independent tactical game?  It definitely seems like, in a lot of old school dungeon play, the fiction was significantly less important to the overall experience than it often is now.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite>Is rolling shitty damage somehow magically better than missing quickly and moving on?</blockquote>\nNo, but rolling shitting damage in a "no miss" system is the same as whiffing, definitely.  But if it was like Final Fantasy and the damage was less random, then you don't really have that problem.  For example, you could have: "Auto-Crossbow; Damage: 80+6d8 to up to 6 targets; Suggested Alternate Non-Damage Effects: immobilize opponents, destroy cover/objects, create handholds, etc."<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>Also, look at it from the other side:  if you can miss the bad guys, then <i>the bad guys can miss you</i>.</blockquote>\nBut this isn't strictly true, right?  Just because you can't miss, that doesn't necessarily mean the NPCs can't miss.  Things don't have to be perfectly symmetrical.  Of, if you never want any of the main characters to get shot, you can always just rule that NPCs can only use "Alternate Non-Damage Effects" of their weapons.  NPCs could be obstacles, but not real threats to characters' lives.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>I also think it's important failure exists as a contrast to success. Success would be dull if there wasn't sometimes a failure to complement it.</blockquote>\nHmm, I agree with this in principle.  However, I have a tough time getting excited about failures that seem so mundane.  To me, the interesting failures don't come from characters trying things and having them not work, they come from attempting more large scale courses of action that end up being misguided or not leading to the results that they wanted, due to the actions of others, not just the whims of fate. If the whims of fate were embodied in the decisions of another player (like a GM or just another player providing antagonism) then I would be cool with that, but if you're failing just because the dice don't go your way... I'm not sure.  I don't think I buy it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180834/#Comment_180834" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-30T06:28:38+00:00" title="November 30, 2008  6:28AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aside: In the game Fable 2, you can't really fail combat.

With a fellow PC, that is the game sheltering the target from your story grab at their expense.  There are examples in books, movies, etc. of the big back stab that doesn't do the job.  It can often be followed by a surprised and hurt look for a beat and then a brutal retaliation or other response (sometimes, the other character sees just how far he or she has strayed if their loyal toady tries to off them).  All of these cool options fail to happen if every back stab just plain works and is fatal to the target just because it is creative input.<br/><br/>The point of almost every system in RPGs is to choose what input is empowered and what input is sidetracked.  Drama comes from working within those confines.  That being said, the whiff at moment of betrayal is definitely not "nothing happens", nor will be the response (even if that response is just a hurt look).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180837/#Comment_180837" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-30T06:58:13+00:00" title="November 30, 2008  6:58AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Jon, meh.

As I imagine it, what happens is that -- as the count goes down -- the characters' actions negotiate with the other events occurring (the GM, basically) and, when the end count is reached, an outcome is arrived at.  Outcomes could then include all sorts of things: slaying the monster, befriending the monster, finding out the monster wasn't actually a monster after all, even being eaten by the monster (what would in other games be achieved by "losing," in this game would still involve reaching the end of the count and attaining a resolution).  Also, there would probably be an option to cease engaging with the challenge and start doing something else, which would leave the monster / challenge in an unresolved state, unbeaten one way or the other. Between strongly paced encounters there would still be a lot of freeplay; anything could potentially have a count, but not everything would, just things you wanted to progress towards resolving in a formal way.<br/><br/>It would be something like a 4E version of the monsters in <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/projects/mwaantaangaand/" rel="nofollow">Mwaantaangaand</a>, which are basically counters, a pacing mechanic instead of a threat or resource-management instance.  It also, come to think of it, shares a lot in common with, <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/2008/08/22/avatar-breakdown/" rel="nofollow">the pacing mechanic I described over here</a>.  It could even be arranged hierarchically, like that one, where reaching resolution on low-level encounters would cause countdowns to progress on higher-order events (liberating the kingdom, killing the evil god, etc.).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181047/#Comment_181047" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-01T12:25:13+00:00" title="December  1, 2008 12:25PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not as convinced as many posting to this thread that "nothing happens" is an outcome completely without value.  Or at least "nothing happens, yet..."<br/><br/>I cite as a personal example some fairly recent D&amp;D4 play, where near the end of the fight, my Fighter got taken down.  So now I'm making Death Saves every round.  And our only cleric is hanging from the remnants of a cut rope bridge, desperately trying to claw his way back up so he can get to me.  And the rest of the PCs were mopping up the last of the opposition, so they didn't have the bandwidth to do anything for me.<br/><br/>So there were several rounds of rolling a die, crossing my fingers for "nothing happens" while the Cleric is trying to make his climb roll.  And yeah, sure, in some other systems this could have all been wrapped up in one neat die roll with no neutral outcomes.. "Does the fighter live or die", but see all those rounds of whiffing built *tension* and it was totally awesome.  Sure, in a neat one roll conflict resolution system you could narrate about how the Cleric desperately climbs, slides back, climbs again, finally makes it up, and reaches the fighters side just as he's about to expire, but for me, without experiencing the moment by moment uncertainly myself, it just wouldn't have the same impact.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181049/#Comment_181049" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-01T12:26:43+00:00" title="December  1, 2008 12:26PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>You could even have a unified combat / skill challenge system where the Duke has a "30" around his neck and that's how much negotiating you have to do before the final result is reached.

The system allows for a fixed duration (e.g., 3 exchanges), a random duration (e.g., 2d4 exchanges), unpredictable duration (e.g., when a 6 comes up on a 1d6 at the end of any round), or a player-determined duration (e.g., when a player "calls" the conflict to resolution).

Here's a few unformed thoughts on various options.<br/><br/>One would be an fiction-leading approach like <i>In a Wicked Age</i>, where the pacing mechanic would structure the challenge without providing clear guidelines for resolving anything.  So, in your example, it would depend on the order in which all those things happened in the fiction, how the GM chose to play the monster, and other things of that sort.  If I was calming it, then you intimidated it right before Graham poked it in the eye, it would probably run away, holding one claw over its bleeding socket. But, most likely, the monster would also be doing things in the meantime, things that might negotiate a different sort of outcome.  Like, maybe it would use its Inflict Horror power to cause Graham's "but I'm really a pansy" trait to countdown to 0, making Graham wet himself instead of stabbing it in the eye.  That hints at a slightly more complicated system, whereby one might target things besides a generic "reach the end of this encounter," such as outstanding plot elements, character development, and the like.  So one could conceivably be working on multiple different counts at once, of which "the current encounter" might not even be the most interesting.<br/><br/>There could also be more formal guidelines for negotiating outcomes.  I can imagine a way of sorting out when players are cooperating at achieving a countdown and when they are working at different purposes, working on different counts.  For example, all three of us might be trying to make different things happen and the one who reaches 0 first is the one who gets their result first.  That doesn't necessarily prevent other characters from achieving their count as well, but it does help provide structure to the resolution if characters are being more competitive.  If you scare the monster away before I can calm it, that probably means my plan is less likely to work now.  Also, it becomes harder for Graham to stab it if it's running away.  But, then again, the encounter if over faster if we're not working so directly at cross-purposes, which supports the majority or a consensus in a way I think it not uncommon or unusual.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181063/#Comment_181063" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-01T13:28:42+00:00" title="December  1, 2008  1:28PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's also, always, Mist-Robed Gate's approach, which is: everybody contributes a colored stone to a bag, based on the points they contributed to the count.

(Although my Marvel and the Wushu system still have some "whiff" value, in the sense that it's possible to not add anything to the resolution phase. So now this thread has given me pause. Perhaps a "white result" in Marvel would *still* add something to resolution, just in a very limited way. It stinks that you could spend all that time narrating traits and still have nothing to add?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181139/#Comment_181139" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-02T03:41:17+00:00" title="December  2, 2008  3:41AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Missing" is a necessary cost of the potential pre-roll excitement which depends on risk. Often in D&amp;D it comes down to "do I hit? If I miss, I will die?". It's like the potential for your character to die in a manner outside your control. In D&amp;D, this helps make the game exciting. There are so many times when characters and creatures are almost finished, and then it becomes like Russian roulette.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were playing D&amp;D the other day, and one character had been mentally commanded to attack another. Every single roll was tense. In this case, though, everyone was hoping for a miss. This is more exciting that I hit, I do a bit of damage (which of course also happens in D&amp;D).<br/>\n<br/>\nMissing can be funny, and lead to mockery from other players, particulary, repetitive missing. I really enjoy weapons which do extra damage or have amusing effects on certain fixed rolls, because that has the same effect as the possiblity of missing, but in reverse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181141/#Comment_181141" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-02T04:14:51+00:00" title="December  2, 2008  4:14AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, <i>Wushu</i>.  I'm a big fan of Clint's <i>Roanoke</i>, so I've played it a bit.  You're totally right that enemies in that game work in the countdown fashion, more or less, and I'd totally overlooked that. The central mechanic of <i>Wushu</i> though (describe details for dice), isn't really my kind of thing.  When I've played it, we inevitably max out on dice every round and the fiction isn't necessarily any better for all those details.  <br/><br/>I much prefer <i>Mist-Robed Gate</i> for a similar description-based fight mechanic that has a bit more mechanical teeth.  Interestingly, MRG also has a pacing mechanic, based on how fast all the players judge the results of a fight, which shows when the fight ends.  That's a bit more arbitrary than the kind of thing I was imagining, but might actually work better in some cases, because the pacing would adapt to player desires.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chearns</cite><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=8059&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">Straight to damage</a>.</blockquote>\nWow, that's like this same thread, but a month older.

Any action in the fiction which calls for priviledge is declared before rolling. If you roll low, you can still act in pretty much any way which isn't attacking the enemy. So, if you roll crap, then you can do whatever else you'd like, according to the priviledge you have, and there are certain actions which you can always do, and so while waiting for your turn (which doesn't take nearly as long), you have layered decision making: "If I roll X, I plan on A, if Y then B, else C."<br/><br/>Rolling still matters, and being better at what you do accords you further narrative priviledge more consistently in those particular arenas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181166/#Comment_181166" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-02T08:03:55+00:00" title="December  2, 2008  8:03AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jarrod</cite>In a nutshell: You roll before you declare any action in the fiction, because you're not rolling to hit, you're<i>rolling for priviledge</i>in the fiction.</blockquote>\nThat's sort of how <a href="http://misspentyouthgame.com/" rel="nofollow">Misspent Youth</a> deals with this.
