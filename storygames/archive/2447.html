                    Over in  <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2445" rel="nofollow">the picture thread</a>, Brand suggested we get a thread to talk about <blockquote>If anyone would like to discuss the idea about gaming as part of your life with your normal friends vs gaming as a special thing set apart in the context of geek/not-geek, I think that could be an interesting discussion.

                            These days I mostly have friends I game with. Some of these folks started out as gaming friends, but at this point we're all so into each others lives that (most of the time) we still hang even when we haven't gamed together in some time. When things do go wrong they go wrong because of life, rather than because of game. Frankly, this type of group is more or less necessary for me to have fun in a game at this point, and I can't imagine not having it. <br/><br/>However, I think there can be some positive things about the gaming friends angel -- especially in the context of things like Nerd SoCal. Having groups where people can get together to do something they're passionate about directly and without interference is awesome. It's like having a ball-league or such. If you want to hang with the others you can, but that isn't the focus of the activity. However, I'd be willing to bet that many people do make friends, real life friends, from such activities.                        </div>

                            I'll put up. I don't game with my friends. Most of my social friends are too damn busy. So am I. Seriously. <br/><br/>We are almost all parents of at least one young child. Most of us have significant community involvement: politics, volunteering, religious groups, schools... In practice, we see fairly little of each other socially except in contexts around one of those activities or at big, all-ages social gatherings. It's a great day when I see the grownups for something grownup - it tends to happen about 5-6 times in a year. Even though a number of them are gamers or likely to enjoy games, it would take away from our social time to use it to game together. We like other things more.<br/><br/>I like to game, though. In practice, that means I game with people who can accomodate my schedule and my picky tastes, whether we're friends or not. This isn't actually working out so wonderfully lately on the "actually getting to play" front, but it has worked well in the past. I find I have very little in common socially with most of the people I've met in this way, so we don't tend to become social friends.                        </div>

                            I have three groups that I tend to game with, and they sort of represent different points on the "gaming as a social activity" spectrum, I think, running from "acquaintances with the potential to be friends" to "friends who I talked into gaming and who really quite like it."<br/><br/>The "more acquaintances" group is my newest one, not coincidentally -- we've only had two sessions of the game.  The GM is a casual friend, part of my larger friends network, but not someone I've spent a lot of time with on a one-on-one basis.  I know the other three players even less well, although all three are good friends of my good friends, so I've seen them around.  It's my hope, frankly, that I'll become better friends with everyone through our game, since I've always liked these guys but never quite took it upon myself to get to know them better.<br/><br/>The second, "inbetween group" I tend to think of as the West Philly group.  There's a core of 5-7 of us, with a lot of other people who're willing to get roped in for a short game, or who could easily participate in a longer campaign in the future.  Starting out, I knew one of the guys really well -- he was the one who talked me into playing in the first place.  I knew the GM less well, but still thought of him as a friend, and I was acquainted with the other four players -- I'd seen them at parties, probably chatted with them all at one time or another over a beer or a smoke, but I probably wouldn't have quite called them friends.  Through the course of gaming together, I've definitely gotten closer to the two guys who were friends to begin with, and I also ended up cultivating a close friendship with Tim, who played the other ratkin in our TSOY game.  He and I spent a lot of time scheming together over email and discussing what our characters were going to do next, and gradually started to talk about life stuff as well as gaming stuff.  Now I hang out with him and his wife in non-gaming contexts quite regularly.  The rest of the group I'm not as close with, but they've gone from nodding acquaintances to being people I invite to parties and who I'm generally happy to hang out with.<br/><br/>The last group is, I think, possibly the classic "friends who game together, just like they'd go see a movie together or something" kind of thing.  I actually met all of them through my knitting circle, although we also hang out in non-knitting contexts!  One day whilst knitting, I mentioned how much fun I was having with the West Philly gaming crew, and it turned out that my friend Rachel's husband was an avid GM and game designer.  Rachel and I convinced a bunch of other people from the knitting group, who all had little to no gaming experience, to try it out with us.  Now we meet monthly for gaming, in addition to our knitting circles and other hanging out.                        </div>

There's a subset I'd definitely game with, assuming time constraints were less strict. I have played with a couple of them in the past. In fact, we ARE planning to play some DitV with a friend and someone she knows this spring - but it's taken quite a bit of planning to get 4 sessions over 2 months scheduled. There's another subset where I might, but some of the stories I've heard about their games make me think I wouldn't have much fun - it's very much a "GM vs Players" kind of group.<br/><br/>We keep intending to break out <i>Shab al-Hiri Roach</i> or PtA on the occasional gatherings, and there's been interest,  but usually by the time we've done enough social catch-up we're all a bit too well-lit for gaming.                        </div>

                            Oh, and here's another example. I used to play with a group that was very much the group-of-friends model. I was only sort of part of that group - I was dating someone who was part of it, but didn't have the same social history together as the rest of them - but they were quite welcoming and friendly. The issue I had with the group, though, was that socializing was really the primary purpose of gaming together. It often took half the session to actually start, and we interrupted for tangents, tea, and banter so much that very, very little typically happened in a session. I was much too focused to have fun with that group for long.<br/><br/>Typically when I'm gaming, I want to engage with the game. This doesn't always mesh well with socializing.                        </div>

                            See, that's funny, in my experience the socialization issue in groups who know each other tangentially is worse than with groups that know each other intimately. The groups who know each other intimately have a common practice of shutting down the smalltalk and getting into the game, and have a greater respect as audiences when they are not in active play. Whereas the tangential groups I've played with keep socializing even after repeated pleas to focus because they're getting to know each other, and the group dynamic doesn't flow as well. And in play, people who aren't in active play chat in the background about things unrelated to game, which is really destructive to the group's focus.                        </div>

                            I do both.  My Tuesday group is my friends that I hang out with every Friday night for movies or while doing stuff on weekends.  If an RPG adventure has ended, we'll do board games, or play poker, or go bowling.  Our gaming is a social activity and so it's common for gaming to branch off into tangents and off-topic conversations.<br/><br/>My every-other Wednesday group I know only through gaming.  I met Andy at a local RPG.net meet and he later invited me to join a new biweekly group.  This group is more experimental and more focused, and it has swapped out a few members over the years.<br/><br/>I find both groups very rewarding and they both satisfy different needs.                        </div>

Oh, I'd agree about groups who know each other <i>intimately</i>. What I'm thinking of is more along the lines of groups of friends in the social-friends way. They have a bunch of common interests, they all go to each other's dinner parties, they e-mail back and forth, they went to college together or whatever, but they're not <i>close</i> in an emotional way.<br/><br/>In my experience, Minnesotans don't really DO the intimacy thing except with very long-term relationships. Often, not even with family. It's one of the things I find difficult about living out here.                        </div>

Heh. Wow. Maybe it's a Canadian thing, maybe it's just a me thing (I'm honestly interested in knowing which) but I don't have those kinds of distinctions, or probably more accurate, those kind of freindships. If I call you "friend" and I go to your house for dinner, especially if you come to my house for dinner, and we went to school together and I still talk to you? We're emotionally intimate. <br/><br/>Did you come from somewhere else to live in Minnesota?                        </div>

                            I know what Mark is writing about. The distinctions are very clear to me. I see a couple of levels of friends and I don't know if this is something from growing up in the Midwest (Iowa) and living in Minnesota now, but I can see three levels of friends: acquaintances, friends, and close-intimate friends. I have acquaintances-friends who I work with, gone to parties with, but I wouldn't really consider them friends, although we'd probably hang out at a bar if we ran into each other. Then I have friends, who I'd hang out with, but not really get close to, and then I have friends who I know everything about and would drop everything on a dime if they needed my help.<br/><br/>My girlfriend, who grew up in Indiana, went to college in Wisconsin, moved to Iowa and now lives in Minnesota doesn't see these kind of distinctions. Could it be a female/male thing?<br/><br/>Mark, what part of MN are you in? I'm on the North Shore of Superior.                        </div>

It's just that I only rarely think of my social friends as friends. They're sort of like... people I don't want to hurt.

                            I'm in Minneapolis, having come out here for college in 1986 from Western New York. Growing up, I kinda bridged two cultures with regard to the friendship/intimacy thing. My family's reserved-in-public, informal-in-private hard-drinking upper-class German-English. Almost all my friends and peers were Italian Catholics, with the big extended family network and the loud emotions. So I can do both.                        </div>

                            For me it's a mix...<br/><br/>- I won't play with people I don't think I could be friends with outside of gaming.<br/>- Even if they are gaming friends vs. friends I game with.<br/>- And when I play with friends I game with... I try to treat them like gaming friends for the duration of the game.<br/><br/>On <a href="http://www.nerdnyc.com/forum/" rel="nofollow">nerdnyc.com</a>, our sections for Get-Togethers, Four Star General, Self Promotion, News, Politics &amp; Current Events, Food/Health, and Nerdslist (our job/selling/trading area) all come before RPGs. Because we want the people we game with to be people we would also hang out with (even if we don't or can't). <br/><br/>It works really well except I think we end up alienating players who just want to game (usually because they are too busy, shy, or other reasons) and don't want to be friends outside of gaming. <br/><br/>This model also reached a critical mass. It worked really well when the community was 40-60 people. But when it hit 100+, small groups start to form that interact with larger group less and less and it becomes harder and harder for new people to break in. It also becomes a physical space problem. It's hard to find affordable spaces that fit more than a 100 people. And making dinner reservations for more than 15 people can be a nightmare. <br/><br/>So I can understand why at some point it may make sense to separate groups based on activity (although I hate it). <br/><br/>On the flip side, we've had gaming friends turn into friends we game with. Which meant we hung out more but gamed a bit less. One of our players mentioned that we've become excellent socializers but tardy gamers! And although we're having lots of fun I never want to let go of the gaming part. <br/><br/>This is a very dear topic to me that I'm constantly trying to navigate.                        </div>

                            Most people I've ever gamed with were my friends first and fellow gamers second. There have been a few exceptions when I first started, but nowadays, I only game with close friends. (Or my girlfriend. Or my brother.)<br/><br/>I really prefer it that way. For me, gaming is a high-trust activity and I'm very hesistant to game with people I don't really know. The best type of game is when we're all sitting around at my girlfirends place, talk bullshit, cook and eat together and then, if we feel like it, game.

                            Ah, see, I was coming from a somewhat different angle.<br/><br/>I game with friends.  Some of these friends I only see in games.  Which is sometimes a little frustrating, but we're all crazy-busy and there just isn't <em>time</em> to hang out when there are, you know, games to play.  Given the opportunity, I'd catch a movie, go camping, or whatever else with any of my friends -- it's just that the opportunity never arises.  My standard of "friend" is more or less "would you help them move?" and if anybody I gamed with was moving and asked for help, I'd help -- assuming the move date wasn't already taken by some other commitment.<br/><br/>The suggestion that I have to do other things with my friends or else they aren't my friends annoys me.  It disparages my relationship with them.  "Oh, you're not <em>really</em> friends, you're just geeks who play a game together."  Fuck that.  These are my friends.  I would help them move.  I don't go hang out and watch <em>Lost</em> with them, but that's because we prefer playing <em>PTA</em> anyway.                        </div>

                            I don't know who may have made that suggestion, Josh. Last I heard it, it was precisely that you would do other things with them if you had the time - or would help them move if they asked.<br/>
<br/>
Rather, the only critique I've heard is about people who play with folks who they would not help move.<br/>
<br/>
Mark... would you help move those other folks?<br/>
<br/>
I'm from the Midwest, and I think that every relationship is a fluid thing that changes all the time. I have some life-long friends, and I don't think we'll ever stop being friends, these particular ones. But that's not to say that the natures of our relationships haven't changed over time. So I think that categorizing into levels works best in terms of specific tests like Josh's. For person X, would you help them move? Would you go out to a movie with them if you had time to do so that didn't eat into your play time?<br/>
<br/>
In any case, if there are people who can make playing with strangers work for them, more power to them. Nobody's saying that there's anything morally wrong with playing with strangers. Just that, observably, such games tend to suck. For instance, stories of character rape (where the player's character is raped and it's painful for the player - not where the player is collaborating in creating a story about rape), don't occur amongst people who are friends. It's only when you don't feel socially capable of dealing with the other participants of a game that it can devolve into something like that, unaddressed. My Guy Assholism is much easier for somebody to pull off, and much more likely, if they don't care about what the other players feel. Etc, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I don't have any scientific evidence, but I've been on both sides of the fence, and I can tell you which hasn't worked out for me. Meaning which side has resulted in games that have ended with players screaming at each other, for instance. I didn't usta know better.<br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Mark... would you help move those other folks?</blockquote>
I think this must be a really variable culture thing, because that question doesn't scan for me. I'll help people I <i>really dislike</i> move. Moving sucks. I can, it's the right thing to do, you asked? I'll help. Candidly, I may prioritize it pretty far down the list of things I have to do this weekend if you're not someone who I feel a bond of obligation or affection to, but I don't think of this as a friend question.<br><br>For me, friend levels have a lot more to do with how much you share about yourself than what kind of social obligations you're willing to assume. Thus, gaming with "gaming friends" is more of a narrow, contractual sort of relationship. I don't NEED to trust them for anything beyond the game, and they most likely don't WANT to know anything more about me than that I like to play fighters.                        </br></br></div>

                            I don't understand your answer. Would you "prioritize" it so low that you wouldn't help?<br/>
<br/>
Think of one of the players in question. Imagine that he asked. Would you actually show up and help them move?<br/>
<br/>
This might be easier: Would they never think of asking you to help? Because it would be socially awkward? Because you're not really at that level of socialization with them?<br/>
<br/>
Would I be a jerk if I noted that the fact that you don't play with people like this anymore seems to be an interesting data point? You say that "it has worked well in the past." Well, why aren't you still doing it, then?<br/>

Not a jerk, Mike, although you do read a little hostile. I'm not currently doing it because it doesn't meet my current needs.<br><br>Would and have helped casual gamer (and other) acquaintances move.

                            It seems to me that there is a range here.  <br><br>On the one hand, there is only playing with people whom you know well and would help move.

I'm pretty close with the two long-term gaming groups that I've been in, but I also play with other groups that I'm not terribly close with along with various play at conventions, mini-cons, or other gatherings.

                            I talked in another thread about the intimacy level implicit in the types of games I play, so I come from that standpoint with this.  For all of that, I did have another gaming group (the last one I played with, actually) where we <span style="text-decoration: underline;">weren't</span> friends outside gaming: one of those groups I met over the 'net, who played the obscure game I liked to play.  I just didn't enjoy myself.  There wasn't any of the debriefing-over-dinner, or the fond retellings, or any of the bits I associated with "keeping the game going outside the game" that I like, let alone real outreach towards relationships.  I mean, the folks were super nice (one let us bring our kids to his bachelor apartment, for a big example) but I and my husband both just didn't connect. [shrugs]  It made the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">game</span> disappointing.<br><br>[edited to add]<br>So looking at it from the "geek" standpoint, it's no more "outside" than the groups I otherwise associate with; whether from the ministry, my job, any family activity, a baby shower, picnic, volleyball game, bowling/karaoke (they go together, right?), or even a group of folks who get together to make crafts.  Sure, it has its own vocabulary and its own number of obsessives, but so do any of the other activities and groups.  I consider myself lucky to have all the crossover I do.                        </br></br></br></div>

I don't think the suggestion is that your gaming folks are not your friends. The suggestion is that the way you preform the activity is not doing anything to de-geek the image of the activity. This is either because it's the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only </span>activity you perform with your friends, or because you have a group that performs the activity in a way that is segregated from the rest of your life. Note that I'm not talking to <i>your</i> life or <i>your</i> friends, but just to speak to the suggestion. All this may well be because when we think towards getting together to do the fun we like to do, we don't consider, or care about making it appear an integrated part of our lives, we care about it being fun.                        </div>

At least one classic geek image is exactly the opposite of this -- namely the stereotype that geeks do everything together, like going to movies, gaming, going out to eat, etc.  A related geek image is that geeks are shy and will tend to form insular groups, rather than activities which connect them to new people -- in contrast to non-geeks who go out where they are surrounded by strangers, like at bars or clubs.  <br><br>I suspect that one can match up either way equally well to geek tropes, which suggests to me that it isn't really related to the geekiness.                        </br></br></div>

I don't know. Maybe this is a regional thing. In my my corner of the world, the first doesn't really exist as geek image outside of high-school settings portrayed in the (American) media (where the AV group are the mathaletes and the gamers as well). As for the latter, that insular-ness  can point to the segregation I was mentioning. <br/><br/>I think there's something to be said for the idea. Any social activity done in moderation, in the open and in balance with a varied body of other kinds of social activity comes off as more and "normal" than any activity done apart, done to a seeming excess, or done out of balance with other activities. It's just simply as the concept of being "well rounded". When well rounded people do a variety of things in balance, each of those things seem more normalized.<br/><br/>I mean, how does the geek factor sit in this statement?<br/><br/>"Bill's a family man with a wife and a three year old little girl. He's a financial analyst who enjoys woodworking and crossword puzzles. He spends his weekends hanging out with his friends playing baseball and roleplaying games or working on restoring classic cars."                        </div>

                            See, as part of the de-geeking bullshit, I'm rather completely disinterested.  I don't find my hobby to be excessively geeky to begin with, and I certainly don't see it as something that needs to be changed so that it conforms with some imaginary average-normal-guy's conception of what 'normal' is.  See, I think I approached this poorly from the start.  It should have been like this:<br/><br/>Malcolm, foaming at the mouth and thrusting a crooked finger at me, screaming: "You over there!  Enjoying yourself on a regular basis with people that you don't do other things with!

                            Moving.  Heh.  I have helped many gaming friends move, and many have helped me.  My husband and I invite only friends to our campaigns, though we do game with more casual acquaintances at conventions and at the local gaming club.  But many years ago we had the "revelation" that gaming for several hours on a weekly basis worked better if it was friends than with people you don't to hang out with outside the game.  This led us to try to introduce friends to gaming, rather than try to find friends among gamers.  <br/><br/>That said, many of the people we met through casual gaming at the club became friends.  We do other things together, like meet for dinner, go see movies or concerts, have parties and barbecues, and on occasion even have a weekend or short vacation trip that involves no gaming: visit a winery, go hiking, etc.                        </div>

                            Josh, <br/><br/>Actually, it was more like HUGE THREAD ON STORYGAMES ABOUT HOW GAMES ARE GEEKED, then Malcolm says, "Huh, I dunno about that. But hey, I like my group and don't think they're geeks. So I'll post a picture of them to show that I don't find my friends to be geeks. If you want to de-geek the hobby, maybe you should do the same. You know, show folks that gaming is something we do with people we like, rather than just something we do at cons and shit with guys dressed as Sailor Moon." <br/><br/>To which the response was, in the forum that started the de-geek idea, "FUCK YOU WE ARE NOT GEEKS HOW DARE YOU JUDGE ME AND MY FRIENDS!" <br/><br/>The funny thing about it is that knowing folks on both sides its 99% about mis-reading, not getting tone, and a now inherited sense of embattled defensiveness. <br/><br/>All in all, I'm not much impressed.                        </div>

It's just simply as the concept of being "well rounded". When well rounded people do a variety of things in balance, each of those things seem more normalized.<br/>Well, I'm not sure.  I've seen it referenced pretty commonly.  For example, Michael Suileabhain-Wilson's <a href="http://sean.chittenden.org/humor/www.plausiblydeniable.com/opinion/gsf.html" rel="nofollow"><b>Geek Social Fallacies</b></a> refer to geek friends doing everything together.  This was fairly true for my college and grad school geeky gaming friends -- we'd go out to movies together, etc.  (I disagree with all of the claimed fallacies being fallacies, but they are part of a broad geek image, I think.)  <br/><br/>As I see it, being insular is different than segregated lives.  The stereotypical insular geek always has his geekiness turned on, and only hangs out with other geeky folks.  He can't pass as non-geeky.  Segregated lives would mean, say, someone who has a normal life where he doesn't seem geeky at all -- but secretly does gaming.  Thus, he doesn't introduce his gaming friends to his other friends or family.  I've seen this several times -- one of my gaming friends is a parole officer who is much like this.  <br/><br/>While I don't see it as an ideal, it does seem considered fairly normal to have segregated activities and friends.  Media stories often show people with a "guys night out" which is separate from family life, for example, and there are plenty of other examples.                        </div>

                            I have a feeling that I keep mentioning this whenever the geek thing comes up, but this thread asks specifically about it, so here goes.<br/><br/>My first RP group consisted of three of my closest friends (only my actually so-called Best Friend wasn't in it).  These were guys who knew things about me that no one else knew.  We played together, we suffered together through sharing our crushes and heartbreaks and divorces and alcoholic parents and whatnot.  And we played a LOT.  Like three to seven days a week, for hours, sometimes 16 hours in a row.<br/><br/>But we were also highly socially active.  We were part of the local party crowd, and our annual joint birthday celebration (my two best friends' and my birthday fall within four weeks) was legendary among people up to several years above and below our own age, bringing together a few hundred people each year.  When Marc and I went to college together, we joined the social science student council, whose main job was to arrange the four big parties each year, and to socially network among students, and we ran the new student orientation training several semesters in a row.<br/><br/>In other words, we were total non-geeks, despite our incredible time and energy investment in RPGs.<br/><br/>When I moved to the states, I joined up with a coworker and his friends.  Aside from going to lunch with one or two of them twice a month, and playing once every five or six weeks, I did not hang out with them socially, and while I liked them, we didn't form much of a bond despite playing together for two years or so.  For one, they live on the other side of town and getting out there for the game was hard enough, and for another we just didn't click in the sort of way that makes me seek someone out actively on my part.  But these were all guys (and the GM's wife, at some point) who were married, in professional careers, with plenty of other activities going on, and the three of them frequently hang out doing other things together, like watch BSG.  The GM and his wife lived in my coworker's garage for seven months after coming back from the Peace Corps, so there must be some true friendship there.<br/><br/>My experience with the geek factor, therefore, has been pretty limited.  For most of my gaming life, it's been one of the main activities, but by far not the only one, I've done with my closest friends.                        </div>

                            Christ, I don't help my best friends move, and I don't ask them to help me; because it sucks. Anyway, it works out a lot quicker if you just get some moving guys and do it in one go instead of farting around all day with somebody's car and a trailer. Then you can go out or play games or something â€“ with your friends. And nobody's hurt their back or smashed their hand between a bed and the door.<br/><br/>i have a question: how is posting pictures on LiveJournal or on roleplaying forums supposed to de-geek anything? What does it prove? Who exactly is going to look at these pictures and say "Wow, those guys look <i>cool</i>! And they all look like such good friends! I want me a piece of that action!"<br/><br/>I've played with lifelong friends and I've played with people I see mainly for gaming. Both have their advantages and disadvantages: old friends can get you stuck in a rut; game pals aren't as intimate. Occasionally the lines blur and an acquaintance gets upgraded to a friend. All that's entirely separate from the question of geekiness. I've got non-geeky friends and friends who are terminal geekazoids. Likewise with the acquaintances.                        </div>

                            Sorry for the slightly-late reply; i've had it half-finished sitting on my computer for several days, but was really busy.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mo</cite>See, that's funny, in my experience the socialization issue in groups who know each other tangentially is worse than with groups that know each other intimately. The groups who know each other intimately have a common practice of shutting down the smalltalk and getting into the game, and have a greater respect as audiences when they are not in active play. Whereas the tangential groups I've played with keep socializing even after repeated pleas to focus because they're getting to know each other, and the group dynamic doesn't flow as well. And in play, people who aren't in active play chat in the background about things unrelated to game, which is really destructive to the group's focus.</blockquote>
I think you're used to playing with extroverts. IME, intrtoverts don't behave that way.  Frex, when i run a game at a convention, i can perfectly comfortably sit there until the game begins without saying a word to the players as they arrive, and then only interact with them within the context of the game. And when playing in a game with strangers, or even acquaintances, it would never occur to me to socialize with them--i'm not avoiding it, it just doesn't occur to me.<br/><br/>Amongst introverts, it's only the well-acquainted groups that get easily distracted, IME. It probably doesn't help that most of them are there to do something with friends first and foremost, and the specific something (RPG) is secondary. But even with "hardcore gamer" groups, we've had that problem.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>It seems to me that there is a range here.<br/><br/>On the one hand, there is only playing with people whom you know well and would help move. This seems like a tighter, more intimate model of gaming -- parallel to inviting close friends over for dinner or such.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there is playing with acquaintences whom you aren't that close with. This is a more casual, less insular model of gaming -- parallel to some people's approach to clubbing, bowling, or such.<br/><br/>I do both. I'm pretty close with the two long-term gaming groups that I've been in, but I also play with other groups that I'm not terribly close with along with various play at conventions, mini-cons, or other gatherings. I recently met up with some people via meetup.com whom I played with, for example.</blockquote>
See, the problem i run into is that the people who're "general" friends and i prefer to game with, precisely because of the easier/greater intimacy that several people have pointed out here, and the sorts of stories/games it enables, the gaming doesn't work for other reasons. Problem is most of my friends have considerably different tastes in gaming: most of them want a game first and foremost, and RPGs are just one way to get their fix; i really am only interested in the RP side of things, and consider the mechanics a necessary evil, and  have pretty much no interest in non-RPG games of any sort. Related to that, they like crunchy games with lots of fiddly bits and "game balance" (one of them immediately noticed a mechanical exploit in Dust Devils); i prefer nothing more complex than Dust Devils or OtE or Story Engine (even DitV is really more crunch than i want). They mostly are interested in accomplishments (slay the dragon, gain a new skill, learn the enemy's secret plan); i'm mostly interested in character exploration and interesting (read: hard moral) choices. Finally, i have one player who can't stand intra-party conflict (which is funny, 'cause he's such a huge fan of competitive games); i love conflicting PC goals just as much as i love seeing conflicting main characters in a TV show.<br/><br/>And the one player in my current group who is none of these things, and has roughly the same tastes in RPGing as i do pretty much comes with her husband, who's the most extreme example (within this group) of all the above.<br/><br/>So, I've not had any problem turning  my friends into gamers, but that's only half the battle.                        </div>

                            Maybe its just the weird differences between my friends and I, but I have more success with gaming friends than I do with friends that I game with.  That isn't to say that I do not game with both, it just seems that games have a lot more zing if its outside of my close circle of friends.                        </div>

<p>Did I ever post here?</p>
<p>I've tried to play games with people who aren't my friends. It basically totally sucks. There is this whole lack of the shared awareness of interests that allows a friends-game to dwell on topics we find mutually interesting and punch things up when someone is casting bored cues; this is frustrating! Also, with friends, the "static" kind of table talk, which distracts from the game rather than reinforcing it, seems to be reduced; when my friends from home play Settlers of Catan, we posture about how massive our wood is, and when we play Exalted, we talk about our Effortlessly Rising Flame, but we don't wander into topics that aren't in the game's orbit.</p>
<p>Even the people I play with regularly online, I consider them "friends I game with", and I think this makes a big difference with regard to where our comfort zones are and how we manage spotlight time and how we deal with game snafus. There's a level of trust and commitment there that wouldn't be present with a "gaming people" group.</p>
<p>This might be a product of our play culture rather than some more subtly emerging social effect, but it's stark and unpleasant enough that I strongly prefer to befriend someone before I am interested in playing with him.</p>

I'm glad to see I'm not the only person to say this. <br/><br/>It also reminds me, middle-class drone that I am, of a mantra from <i>How I Met Your Mother</i>'s Barney:
<blockquote>Asking someone to come see your play is like asking them for a ride to the airport or to crash on the couch or to help you move. Call a cab, book a room, hire some movers. Friends don't let friends come see their crappy play!</blockquote>
The above is fine when you're in college or are a struggling twenty-something asking favors of your struggling twenty-something pals. If you're an employed thirty-something or above, you hire some damn movers. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: crowyhead</cite>I have three groups that I tend to game with, and they sort of represent different points on the "gaming as a social activity" spectrum...</blockquote>
I have three groups as well. Two of them started out with "player finder" posts/sites. The third was born out of one of the first two. In essence, these were total strangers I just started gaming with.<br/><br/>4-5 years later, I'd say that a good portion of these groups are now people I consider friends. We get together for dinner parties, our wives hang out, and we help each other out (unless it involves moving; see above). There's maybe one person out of the three groups that I have no interest in seeing outside of game (much less inside, but that's not for discussing here).<br/><br/>In college, I gamed with people who were friends first. I mean, they were gamers, but we became friends before we decided to ever game together.<br/><br/>In high school, I gamed with my best friends... most of whom I met by showing up to game with (near-)total strangers.                        </div>
