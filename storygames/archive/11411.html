We have one player in particular who wears his heart on his sleeve and is very sensitive.  He is also extremely defensive at times.  We're all good buds and have been gaming together for years so we know each other well.<br/><br/>The problem is best summed as thus: we're currently playing WFRP 3e and the sensitive player chose an Action Card which is proving to be clearly broken.  We're playing with Narrativism in mind so the fact that he's so strong isn't a big deal, except for the fact it is making combat very boring for all of the other PCs at the table.  While they will kill 2 or 3 enemies between them, the other player is routinely killing two to three times as many (he killed 12 out of 14 enemies in one recent fight).  <br/><br/>If it was one of the non-sensitive players, we could have a reasonable discussion about it and they would be generally agreeable and drop the Action Card, switching it out for a more balanced card.  This player, however, will argue and perhaps grudginly agree in the end - but it may ruin his entire experience of the game and he may go as far as wanting to create a new character since he was forced to nerf his.<br/><br/>What would you do?  We're all adults and the sensitive player is a great, intelligent person.  Sometimes he just can't help but overreact and go overboard.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254119/#Comment_254119" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T15:59:02+00:00" title="January 31, 2010  3:59PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you entertaining a duplicitous solution here? I mean, are you willing to walk over his interests and trick him in some manner to make this work? I'm asking because I've dropped that angle in my own rpg dealings, so I'd have rather limited tools in this sort of a situation myself: truth and whatever comes out of that, including breaking up the game, would be almost the only thing I could do. I'd probably drive design first into the truthful discussion: explain to him that I think that the game's rules are broken and need to be amended, and here's why, and here's how. Alternatively, I might decide that I actually am willing to take the challenge of playing the game with uneven intra-party balance, at which point I'd go into adventure planning with that in mind. The new Warhammer seems like it'd be difficult to use for narrativism, but if it is possible, chances are that one character being more powerful than the others wouldn't be much of a problem.<br/><br/>If you're willing to try to be tricky, one solution that springs to mind is to simply give more attention to the other players to counter-balance this one character's superiority in combat. Just make the game otherwise more interesting to the others. One way of making this seemingly innocuous is to pile on some power-ups to all the characters, but make it so that while the other characters get interesting character hooks, this one character just gets a more powerful weapon or other bonus that makes him more powerful in combat. This way you're seemingly being equal while you're in fact just fortifying this character in a specialty he's already dominant in, so he's really getting nothing while you "level up" the other characters to positions and situations that allow them to have interesting things to do regardless of that combat monster character. What these power-ups would be would depend on the campaign, I guess, but maybe something like having the characters move into a big city and join some secret societies or guilds... while one gets into a high position in a merchant guild and another becomes an official court archmage or some such, have the combat monster get a posting with a politically passive mercenary guild, the function of which is to mostly give him some mooks to follow him around.<br/><br/>Continuing in the tricky vein, you could help the other players trick up their characters by remaking them to a more powerful standard. This used to be a major pastime with 3rd edition D&amp;D, rebuilding characters to make them more powerful for the same investment of xp. It sounds like your touchy player wouldn't mind something like this, as it wouldn't impact his own character and could be glossed over as something you get done by email between sessions.<br/><br/>Another trick would be to make use of less combat encounters and more of other sorts of situations. This, again, used to be a common tool in D&amp;D GMing, to customize the challenges so that everybody in the group gets some "screen-time". You could even try for some set-pieces where the combat-efficient character gets to fight while the other characters do other stuff. Like, have him enter into a fighting tournament or some such to distract the big bad while the other characters run around playing detectives.<br/><br/>Hmm... those sorts of solutions one and all seem too fragile and work-loaded to me, though. I've had some pretty touchy players myself, and I have to say that disabusing them of the touchiness has usually been my chosen solution - maybe it is because I'm too impatient to dance around issues. I call their masculinity into question if they start whining, which usually shuts them up. Can't remember this exact sort of thing in my own play, though, as I usually play with utter disregard for inter-party balance even in adventure games. If somebody thinks his character is too weak, I just let him take the risks and maybe get his character more powerful. Then if something broken shows up, I'll just let the player enjoy it for a while, after which we'll make a consensus nerf once everybody agrees that the rules-feature is in fact broken.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254179/#Comment_254179" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T22:10:01+00:00" title="January 31, 2010 10:10PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: agony</cite>What would you do?

Prodigious Power.  Basically, the gods or chaos or whoever has taken note of his prodigious power. Now he can only use it in cases of extreme importance or he might get unwanted attention. Each battle he doesn't use the power give him the system equivalent of "Action Point/Willpower/Token."  He can then use those tokens for whatever their purpose is. He can also use his Prodigious Power for 1 token without attracting attention.  But if he doesn't spend the token and uses his power, things will happen.<br/><br/>In order for this method to work, it is all about presentation. He's a badass, and everyone has realized it. This doesn't take away his badass-ness, but instead enhances it. Think of the old samurai who never uses his exceptional talent in order to not reveal himself. His character is such as badass, that he has to handicap himself in order to make fights "fair." <br/><br/>This isn't my 1st choice, though.  Eero is right, you've got to talk to these people. Someone like this has an extremely poor self image, which gives them a giant, touchy ego. Feeding it and tiptoeing around him is just going to cause his issues to grow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_254186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254186/#Comment_254186" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T23:12:29+00:00" title="January 31, 2010 11:12PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David C</cite>Someone like this has an extremely poor self image, which gives them a giant, touchy ego.
