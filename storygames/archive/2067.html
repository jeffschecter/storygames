                    So I've had the very good fortune to end up with <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2019" rel="nofollow">a lovely set of colour pictures</a> for my game, Six Bullets for Vengeance. I was planning on printing in black and white, but these pictures just beg to be printed in their full glory. But, I know nothing about colour printing. Help!<br/><br/>Are there pod printers who do colour? <br/>Does lulu?<br/>What sort of things do I need to ask/check?<br/>How much of a price hike do you think I'll be looking at?<br/>Colour plates? Full colour interior? What difference does it make?<br/>And is it worth it? EDIT: from a publishing/marketing/business point of view, rather than an aesthetic pov.                </div>

                            Color is about ~$0.25/page at most POD places. Thus color will likely raise the cost of publishing your book by around $1.50/book. Full color interiors--meaning color on most if not every page--is only practical if you go the traditional route and print up 1000-1500+.<br/><br/>The thing with color, though, is that most places is all or nothing, they want to charge you color prices on every page, not just on the pages that have color. Lulu is like that. So you just have to look around and make sure the place is only going to charge you for the actual color pages you use. <br/><br/>I used the former RPI for tMW, and they did great color at a competitive price (for color). But since they were bought out, they've had some issues, so right now I'm looking around for a new place. I'll tell you when I find a new place, or you can tell me if you find a good place.<br/><br/>I think adding color is worth it if you have good art, but that shouldn't be surprising coming from me. It will mess up your pricing scheme, however. Pricing as I'm sure you're aware is based on a percentage formula, such that little jumps in printing translates into big jumps in cover price. You will either be forced to price the book really high or accept that your profit will be lower than what you want. With tMW, the book is priced higher than I wanted, but I make the money I want to on direct sales. However, my profit percentage is fairly low, such that I make very very little money on retailer sales and other discounted sales.                        </div>

                            To offer a somewhat different perspective than Tim:  Lulu will do full color interiors for you, but it costs a few more dollars a copy than printing in black and white.  However, it costs you zero dollars up front, since you don't have to pay for a print run.  Sure, if your ultimate goal is to make a significant profit, going this route makes it much slower, since you're only going to be making a few dollars profit per book unless you price it higher than the current average (around $20 a book). However, if you're like me and profit is not really one of your main concerns and you just want to release an awesome game in color without losing a lot of money, Lulu sounds like your best bet to me.  No up front cost, full color printing that looks good, and simple as pie.<br/><br/>So, basically, Tim's claim that full color interiors "are only practical if you go the traditional route" is really a reflection of traditional indie publishing wisdom and values that may or may not apply to your situation at all.  Certainly, I find them to be Crazy Moon Language, though I can see how they make good sense from a money-making standpoint.                        </div>

                            RPI did a per-color-page charge for both Bulldogs! and Mortal Coil. I got a quote from Ken Whitman at RapidPOD for the same on a Bulldogs! reprint, but I haven't actually initiated that reprint yet. Basically, Lulu wanted to charge me $16 a book for Bulldogs!, as they were charging full-color costs on every page. Crazy moon language or no, that's too expensive.<br/><br/>I'm not 100% on Alphagraphics nee RPI nor on RapidPOD from a service standpoint, but those are my current points of reference.                        </div>

                            The other option, Andrew, is to offer both B&amp;W and Color through Lulu.  If a customer wants the shell out the couple extra bucks for color, it's his perogative.  Or he can get a black and white version.  If you set your profit margin as the same for both B&amp;W and Color, this won't affect the profitability of the book at all.<br/><br/>The important part is that if you, Andrew, want a color copy for your shelf, you can get it, and the rest of the world will be happy with whichever version they get.<br/><br/>(Note: this also works for softcover/hardcover.)                        </div>

I just double checked Lulu. To print tMW at Lulu, 6x9, color, perfect bound, 164 pages, 150 copies (my usual print run) would cost me... $25/book!!! and that's with a 14% bulk discount. That's <b>totally insane</b>. $4.53 base + $0.15/page adds up REAL quick.                        </div>

                            Hmm... that seems a lot higher than I remember when I was running full-color price options for Push, and a lot higher than Brennan's $16 price.  Either things have changed or there are some sizes where color is more expensive than others.  $25 a book IS insane.                        </div>

                            Thanks for the advice guys! Whilst I like the idea of offering both options via Lulu, I think I'm going to explore using colour plates. I'll report back if I find a good printer to do this.                        </div>
