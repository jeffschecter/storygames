A revolutionary new initiative system on a bog standard Fantasy Heart Breaker...isn't innovative...its one of the things that make it a heart breaker.<br/><br/>Likewise a truly innovative game doesn't require unusual never seen before mechanics to be innovative.  I'm actually opposed to envelope pushing / bleeding edge mechanics just for the sake of doing something different.<br/><br/>My aforementioned BRS design goal is to demonstrate this by creating a truly innovative RPG game using absolutely nothing but mechanics that have been liberally lifted from other existing games.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what you're really after in this thread, however.  <br/><br/>If what you're really after is "show me all your hawt never before seen rules", then I guess my only "issue" (such as it is) is that I'd prefer you didn't conflate that with being "innovative".<br/><br/>If what you're really after is "show me how your game designs are innovative and pushing the art of design to new levels", then I guess my isse would be that you're missing the boat if you're looking for that at the level of individual rules.<br/><br/>YMMV, of course, but its a distinction I think is important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183499/#Comment_183499" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-15T14:14:14+00:00" title="December 15, 2008  2:14PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>If what you're really after is "show me all your hawt never before seen rules", then I guess my only "issue" (such as it is) is that I'd prefer you didn't conflate that with being "innovative".</blockquote>\nRalph;<br/><br/>Show me all your hawt, never-before-seen-rules.<br/><br/>-Levi                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183518/#Comment_183518" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-15T15:09:57+00:00" title="December 15, 2008  3:09PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 15, 2008 3:22PM by Brad_J_Murray.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think <a href="http://www.phreeow.net/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=Diaspora" rel="nofollow">Diaspora's</a> explicit recognition of "table authority" as distinct from GM and/or player authority is novel. I don't know that it's unique. I do think it's <i>implicit</i> in a lot of other games. To some degree I think it's implicit in all games.<br/><br/>Edit: specifically:<br/><br/><cite><br/>We also talk frequently about \u201cthe table\u201d and many things happen in the context of the table\u2019s authority. The table is, simply, the sum of the players, the referee included, with all opinions weighed equally. The table is the consensus, and it is more important than any single player\u2019s authority, including the referee\u2019s. Many aspects of the game are explicitly under the power of the table, but it is true whether a game says so or not, that all of the game ultimately lies within the context of table authority. Referees and players alike should pay heed and seek consensus.<br/><br/>So when we say \u201cat our table\u201d we are not talking about rules or even house rules per s\xe9, but rather interpretations arrived at consensually. We leave a lot here to your table and encourage you to seek genuine consensus when elaborating your Clusters, your Systems, and even your Characters. To this end we grant equal weight (though your table may choose otherwise) to all players throughout the First Session. Cluster, World, and Character creation are all egalitarian pursuits.<br/><br/>We\u2019re also, then, tacitly acknowledging that every table is distinct. We wrote this game and play tested it, so it reflects the interests of our table. Your table, however, will necessarily create a different game. That\u2019s not just okay with us, or even expected, but rather that\u2019s awesome. And so, in realising this, we have decided to stay as far away from territory that belongs to your table as possible. <br/><br/>This game recognizes that almost everything past the mechanical is your territory.<br/></cite> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr" title="Lxndr"><img alt="Lxndr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/803/nRIOJTW5OT0WE.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr">Lxndr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183521/#Comment_183521" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-15T15:20:06+00:00" title="December 15, 2008  3:20PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 17, 2008 9:14AM by Lxndr.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Fastlane</b> <a href="http://www.twistedconfessions.com/fastlane.php" rel="nofollow">(link)</a>puts the decision of risk in the hands of each player, making the rewards commensurate with the risk in all cases.<br/><br/>(I've adapted the <b>Fastlane</b> philosophy and system to <a href="http://www.twistedconfessions.com/twists/diceynobilis.php" rel="nofollow">add randomness to Nobilis</a>, and it works well.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183522/#Comment_183522" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-15T15:26:22+00:00" title="December 15, 2008  3:26PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ribbon Drive is a game about road trips and self-reflection. It is GMless.<br/><br/>The innovative rule is this: The last person to speak, in a given scene, has the option to introduce a conflict. You can't declare to the group that you have an idea for a conflict, though you can give a hand signal (holding up a "C" for conflict, silently).<br/><br/>Here's what it looks like in play: People who have ideas on how to "push" the game in new directions need to wait for their turn to contribute, if that's what they want to contribute. People who want to explore character are given the floor. The people who are typically the loudest (myself included?) are silent and tuned in for most of the scene. Two people having good conflict ideas, but not being able to communicate them to each other, leads to one of three possibilities: (1.) one person decides to trust the importance of the other's contribution, (2.) one person finds a non-conflict way that they'd actually prefer to enter the scene, (3.) a stalemate results in a scene without conflict, where characters idly drive along the countryside - worried about many eventualities that may or may not ever come. All three results are beautiful and spot on for the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183563/#Comment_183563" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-15T17:31:47+00:00" title="December 15, 2008  5:31PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ReCoil is the only roll for a number of successes system that I know of where every successful die rolled is used as a success. Specifically, if I roll 3 successes and you roll 5, you may spend 3 of your successes to succeed in a specific action. If that action was what I wanted to do in the first place, I cannot do that... but I can spend those three successes on another successful action. Alternately, if you rolled 5, you may spend two dice to hinder my action. It's not "You rolled 5 successes, I rolled 3.

The points granted as a reward for accomplishing your goal are usable for setting new goals and for advancing your character. Additionally, this same mechanic works as a pacing device for the over-arching story, placed collectively in the players' hands. <br/>\n<br/>\nNone of these games are complete or at least polished enough for me to consider publishing. Rats in the Walls and ReCoil are both available for playtesting, and Mage Blade is hung up on some thorny design areas. My other projects are less complete.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis" title="Grant Davis"><img alt="Grant Davis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis">Grant Davis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183565/#Comment_183565" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-15T17:40:59+00:00" title="December 15, 2008  5:40PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Secrets and Lies is, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">as far as I know</span>, the only RPG to use a draft and trade for character creation. <br/><br/>Robert asked for a link, but be warned that it's a pay <a href="http://e23.sjgames.com/item.html?id=PL002" rel="nofollow">link</a>. So I'll try to describe it.<br/><br/>In the basic game, each player starts by drafting one negative trait. This can be an appearance flaw, lower social class, lower education, and so on.<br/><br/>Then you draft something positive: natural beauty, good metabolism, better education or higher birth.<br/><br/>Continue with three more rounds for age, job skill and "adventure" skills. All the while, players are barganing across the table, planning out which drafts are best for themselves and/or the group. No two players can take the same skill.<br/><br/>Then there is a period of time for card trading, with more bargaining and planning. <br/><br/>Then the GM goes over each character, discarding contradictory drafts and any Job skills that lack the necessary education (for example). Of course, they can advise the players during the whole process.<br/><br/>In the Advanced Draft, all the positive attributes are laid out and drafted at the same time. The negatives are still drafted on the first round so as not to ruin people's planning.<br/><br/>The result is that, by making character creation into a game, game play starts immediately. Creation is a social rather than a solitary experience. The greatest drawback is that you can't come into it with an immutable character concept.  This isn't the only game that does so (Spirit of the Century comes to mind), but it's how Secrets and Lies did it.<br/><br/>-Grant                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183567/#Comment_183567" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-15T17:54:01+00:00" title="December 15, 2008  5:54PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Forbidden City, you always win conflicts.

The challenger uses the pool to create diverse opposition on the spot (i.e., it's not just a Primetime Adventure budget expense, it's creation of tactically-varied opposition); and<br/>c. The challenger offers a success level for each maneuver that the player undertakes, and the player can take the success or go to dice for a risk of gaining more or less.<br/><br/>This trifecta empowers players and alleviates the burden on challengers.<br/><br/>If you need to focus on one specific unique aspect, take c.

Whoa, wait, so I can elevate social debate and one-upsmanship to the same mechanical level as physical combat? Fucking awesome! I can even use a slight twist on my combat mechanics, so they work basically the same. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen, just after I'm done writing up the rules for it, Luke goes and publishes the newer version of BW with the Duel of Wits. My first reaction, completely irrational, is "I was robbed! I was thinking about it first! That fucker Luke!" Then of course I think about it. Luke has PUBLISHED this ruleset. Which means that he's probably played the hell out of it. I only recently finished writing my rules for it. So, no. He thought of it first. That fucker Luke. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen there's ReCoil. I was going for this surreal, matrix-inspired agents projected into a world that's not theirs, hunting down something that can do irreparable harm if it's not stopped. Oh, and reality is kind of subjective. You can pull guns out of the air, and stuff. This is good shit. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen Jared comes out with Lacuna, and I throw my hands up in despair. This time, I *know* I was designing my game first, but I'm just a massive procrastinator, unlike the get-it-done types who get it done. Maybe if I'd been a bit more on the ball, I'd have beat him to the punch. Of course, if Jared had designed Lacuna years earlier, I might never have bothered with ReCoil, and that'd be a damned shame, because if any of my current WDP Projects has a lot of potential to be a killer game, it's ReCoil. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo what if it's been done? Me, with my lackluster roleplaying resum\xe9, I'm making this shit up without having been exposed to the classics. I don't even know who Stafford is. Is it innovative? Nah, probably not. I'll tell you it is and pat my own back anyway though. I'm not fooling you, and I'm not really even fooling me, not anymore. Hence the "that I know of" that has peppered almost all of our claims to innovation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I think Luke is 100% right (that fucker) when he says that innovation is only determined when the rubber meets the road. I guess that makes my claims above into shorthand for "this mechanic is one that I think will be determined as having innovative effects, once the rubber meets the road". But I'd hardly be the cocky sonofabitch that I am if I said it all mealy-mouthed like that, now would I?<br/>\n<br/>\nLord but I'm wordy when I should be going to sleep.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183615/#Comment_183615" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-16T05:14:20+00:00" title="December 16, 2008  5:14AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my game, the elves have blue skin.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183616/#Comment_183616" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-16T05:17:15+00:00" title="December 16, 2008  5:17AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 16, 2008 5:17AM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jared A.

It was either "always the same effect, no matter who casts a spell" or "wildly open rules and magic systems with no real system behind them". So, for Apocalypse Prevention, Inc, I introduced the idea of learning spells, but then the magic-user can personalize certain elements through practice and research.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, if we both learned how to throw a fireball, then we learn the basic incantation to conjure up the flame and launch it at out opponents. However, we both have different personal styles and our fireballs shouldn't be exactly the same. So, I decide to learn how to make mine travel farther. You then learn how to intensify the amount of damage yours can inflict. I then learn tricks to make it take less time for me to cast my spell than you and you learn to make yours explode when it hits its target, hitting others in the area. I could then make mine heat seeking and you could decide to make casting said spell take less effort.

Character and setting are nearly indistinguishable, as your character is just another node on a relationship map containing all the setting stuff. The relationship map ("network") is on a giant piece of paper shared communally with the other players.<br/><br/>In <b>Sex Magic</b>, players can assume a certain amount of controlled REAL LIFE risk (in the form of "Truth or Dare") to remove in-game risk. That is, if you really want your character to succeed at something and think it's not gonna happen, you can instead take a Truth or Dare challenge from another player to have your character succeed automatically. Theoretically, this also affects the mood of play (towards sexyfuntime with the right group), and gets people talking about things that actually matter to them.<br/><br/>In <b>University</b>, the conflict resolution includes bluffing and a certain amount of guesswork. As you narrate in traits, you draw cards. When you think you have a better poker hand than the other side, you call, and show your cards. Maybe you have 10 cards by the end, and your opponent has 12. Do you have a better hand? <br/><br/>In <b>Soviet Russia RPG</b>, the game plays you. Okay, not really. I just made that shit up.<br/><br/><i>ETA the University stuff.</i> </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183651/#Comment_183651" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-16T08:59:32+00:00" title="December 16, 2008  8:59AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's nothing wrong with goobing about cool mechanics, and talking about what innovation is or isn't is the most boring topic ever.

Unpack, please. One example or something.<br/><br/>It works in two parts.<br/><br/>Part The First:<br/><br/>When you make your character, you define four Qualities about him. These are specificially of the form "My character thinks that he is/has _______". These Qualities are narration constraints; both players must narrate consistently with these Qualities and may not narrate against these Qualities.<br/><br/>Example Quality (from my last playtest) "My character thinks that he is a family man." So, I could legitimately object if you narrated my guy sleeping around. He wouldn't do that! He's a family man!<br/><br/>Part The Second:<br/><br/>When you win the Flashback part of the round, among other things, you earn the right to rewrite one of your opponent's Qualities. The rewrite is specifically of the form "...but really he is/has _____". Doing so removes the old Quality and creates the new Quality. All the rules on Qualities apply<br/><br/>Example Quality (from my last playtest) "My character things that he is a family man, but really he has a violent temper." Now, not only have I lost the Quality of "family man", I've gained the Quality of "violent temper". This Quality (in addition to the "manipulative" Quality I had picked up earlier) led to my character getting his girlfriend to lose her temper in front of the children, while she was in the middle of moving out on him. Yeah, vengeance.<br/><br/>Never mind that my original concept was a calm, collected fighter for good and righter of wrongs. Oh no. All that was taken from me, one Quality at a time.<br/><br/>Does that answer your question, David?<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>What are your rules' innovation? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8316/what-are-your-rules-innovation/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="What are your rules' innovation? - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8316/what-are-your-rules-innovation/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Robert, do you really want me to post one of the innovations for pretty much every game I've designed?

So you had things like catch phrases, the ability to die and come back next movie, and a fluctuating stat called star power. You bid star power for your role in the movie and your effectiveness during that movie depended on both your base stats and the importance of your movie role. <br/><br/><br/>On the note of innovations from some games you may not have heard of:<br/><br/>The original printing of the Everlasting: Book of the Unliving contains a detailed ritual which may be performed before play - making explicit the shamanistic idea of story-telling.

My new rule ("published in "Covenants") was that castles have a negative point value. The effects are that:<br/><br/>* In the previous system, most groups spent about a third of their points on their castle, and if you accept a point as a vote, it centred the game on the castle4's defences, making the world the sort of place where sieges were likely.<br/>* It makes home design easier and faster.<br/>* It makes it clear that if you own a castle then you are volunteering for stories in which the local nobility are peeved with you, and its actually those stories that are the basis for the negative points. If there are no stories, you can have whatever you like and its not important, so not worth points.

It was either "always the same effect, no matter who casts a spell" or "wildly open rules and magic systems with no real system behind them". So, for Apocalypse Prevention, Inc, I introduced the idea of learning spells, but then the magic-user can personalize certain elements through practice and research.<br/><br/>I've gotten a lot of great feedback about this feature of my game. If you guys know of others games where this type of magic system exists, I'd love to know. I may be able to get more inspiration to make my system even better perhaps.<br/><br/>-Oni<br/><a href="http://www.thirdeyegames.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thirdeyegames.net</a></blockquote>\nI'd suggest you look at spontaneous casting in Ars Magica.  In Ars Magica, your character has two ways of doing magic: formulaic and spontaneous. Formulaic spells are things you have learned from books, so they are just like the writer's version but with a personal twist on top called a sigil (for example, my character's sigil is oranges, so their smell, taste or colour shows up in all of his spell effects.) The other type, Spontaneous, is where you choose a spell effect base level (say a ball of fire is level 20) and you then up that based on what you choose as your Range, Target and Duration.  So, you have basically talked about Range, damage (which is base level), Tatget (a bigger area), Requisites (in the heat seeking case) and some Mastery abilities (which is where you can cast formulaics more like spontaneous spells because you have spent experience ot be damn good at them).<br/><br/>So, basically if you want to join the fun, we'd like to see you over on the atlas-games forums.  Also, the previous version of Ars is downloadable for -free-, so where the harm in checking it out?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184472/#Comment_184472" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-21T05:01:33+00:00" title="December 21, 2008  5:01AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Timothy, even Harnmaster Magic had spontaneous magic and formulaic spells, but I am not sure of the dates.
