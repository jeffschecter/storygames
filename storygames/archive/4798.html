OKC matches people up based on a huge database of questions; the more you answer, the more confidence the site has in the matching.  The interesting part is that the questions ask how you would answer, and how your ideal mate would answer.  IIRC, there is a way to check "reflexive incompatibilities," where you answered in a way that you wouldn't find acceptable for your ideal mate to answer.<br/><i><br/>Question:  If you were cloned five times, and your five clones sat down to play a roleplaying game, what would work well and what wouldn't?  What sorts of reflexive incompatibilities would show themselves under these conditions?</i><br/><br/>I think one of mine is that my clones would get frustrated with each other for not being active enough.  That probably means that I expect more of other players than I hold myself to in this department.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107818/#Comment_107818" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-11T16:31:37+00:00" title="November 11, 2007  4:31PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, if they're genetic clones they're a generation of development behind me.

Since the Charge-taker is trying to think too quickly, and because everyone else is overcritical, they will keep throwing the Charge-taker's mistakes back in his face.  The Charge-taker will get stressed out at this, and start asking for everyone else's opinion on what to do next.  Answers would be pretty ambivalent all around.

I'm curious what about yourself would annoy you, since it seems reasonable to guess these things might annoy other people too.  The question originates in my suspicion that there are some play styles which are reflexively incompatible.  They work OK in a group of people who don't share the same style, but utterly fail when combined with themselves.  Reversing this thought, if that is true, then there are probably some styles which aren't reflexively incompatible, which would work great if you played with your clones.<br/><br/>This train of thought mirrors something a friend told me recently about one of his relationship strategies.  He said one should make a list of everything you expect from your partner, and for each item on the list, ask yourself if you can be that for someone else.  If not, then it's probably not a reasonable demand to make of your significant other.  I don't know if I believe it, but that's part of what this thread was intended to explore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107845/#Comment_107845" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-11T21:00:47+00:00" title="November 11, 2007  9:00PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Hope you have 911 on your space-speed-dial, honey, my clones are here for another fistfight, I mean gaming session!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107943/#Comment_107943" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-12T09:31:36+00:00" title="November 12, 2007  9:31AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I love traditional player functions, but I have come to hate traditional GMing functions.
