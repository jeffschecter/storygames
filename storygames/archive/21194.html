I'm not talking about advice here, but rules. The type of GMless Story Games I'm talking about are those in which the players have equal roles in creating the story; that is, the players aren't simply advocating for their characters\u2014they're playing their characters in order to create the best story, not advocate for them\u2014and are also taking on the role of creating (together) the story whole-cloth as well. They are the writers of the story and the audience as well. Can you think of any games that fit the bill? <br/><br/>If not, can you think of rules that would be effective in doing so, that would be specific to these type of games?<br/><br/>Edit: Oh, I should probably qualify that I'm looking for universal Story Games that can create any type of story and don't have a preset setting or narrative path to follow.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464331/#Comment_464331" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-26T19:39:17+00:00" title="June 26, 2017  7:39PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Witch: The Road to Lindesfarne</b> and <b>Montsegur 1244</b> are both featherweight RPGs with clear narrative arcs.

That is, all the "narrative threads" are listed right there on your character sheets. To frame a scene, you pick one or more characters from a knight's current Cosmos (actually a simplified, dynamic relationship map) and put them together with the knight. I believe any variation of this general principle is bound to produce viable gameplay, as long as the setting is full of personal conflict for a protagonist to already be enmeshed with and character creation procedures support that.<br/>You can break that, of course, if you keep introducing new characters and situations rather than reusing the existing ones. That can happen in <i>Polaris</i>, insofar that what I described above is more of a "soft" rule than a hard one... I recommend being earnest about only updating one's Cosmos with new stuff as an act of <i>book-keeping</i> - that is, only introducing new stuff as a product of existing elements, as seen on stage/on screen during play (that's implied by the Heart being the player responsible for keeping their own Cosmos updated, IIRC).<br/><br/>That's often subverted - consciously, I hope - into something which makes games more challenging. What I'm thinking of are games where you're told to just make up stuff as you go, writing it down as you do - <i>then</i> you get to a different phase in the game when you're told to reincorporate those threads you've written down (usually as a condition for the game to end at all).<br/>That's how Society of Dreamers by <a href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">@Matthijs</a> Holter works - a game which I otherwise <i>adore</i>, but reincorporating in the endgame is always very challenging, and sometimes way too hard.<br/>That's also how <i>Swords Without Master</i> works, with the additional complication that it's the dice which tell you when to write down something you're going to have to try and reincorporate later. Here, it is clearly stated that the game is meant to challenge players - but you also don't have to reincorporate all the threads created (you're only allowed to reincorporate [number of players -1] in fact), as <a href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">@Epidiah_Ravachol</a> was sort of aiming for a few loose ends to remain.<br/><br/>Also, it's a big plus if you already know what the ending is going to be like (i.e. it's fixed), at least to a degree. What really matters is where each main character ends up being positioned relative to that roughly predefined ending.<br/>Examples: <i>Thou Art But a Warrior</i> (or <i>Starlit Kingdom</i>, which is a reskin of the same) by Anna <a href="/forums/profile/wundergeek">@wundergeek</a> Kreider, where the setting-level predefined ending is the big change from <i>Polaris</i> (in <i>Polaris</i>, that the knights' world is doomed is implied, but players aren't mechanically mandated to witness to that doom: it could well happen in a distant future). <i>Showdown</i>, where we know one of the two main characters is going to die, but not which or why.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464342/#Comment_464342" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-26T21:25:16+00:00" title="June 26, 2017  9:25PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2017 9:39PM by 2097.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nerver av st\xe5l is often claimed to do this well.

The trappings of the setting might be interchangeable, but a lot of them are built around a very specific type of story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464383/#Comment_464383" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-27T19:41:46+00:00" title="June 27, 2017  7:41PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, <a href="/forums/profile/PetteriHannila">@PetteriHannila</a> probably has something to say about *universal* *GMless* *story games* that last *1-3 sessions* and feature *robust dramaturgical control* to encourage a satisfying climax and insightful epilogues.

I'm really hoping BeePeeGee, (who doesn't like to use his real name on the internet because he's wiser than the rest of us <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/> ), ends up publishing this game in book form so I can buy it, or that I can convince him to, if only because it is different. It's definitely worth a read.  After I finish reading it, in all probability we'll play it at Story Games Salt Lake City when we get a chance. After I play it, I'll make sure to do a write up about it  and give some feedback for those who are interested. It may be a bit, I still owe Paul a writeup and some feedback on his game <b>Inconceivable!</b>, which strikes me as a very interesting game. <br/><br/>I'm very interested to see how <b>Inconceivable!</b> turns out being that the design is still wide open and Paul is taking a novel approach. Instead of going into the design knowing what the objectives are that he wants to accomplish with the design, he's taking a much more organic approach and letting the game develop and go in the direction that seems to work best and in which the playtesters most enjoy, leaving that which is superfluous to play or not as compelling to organically fall away. It can still go a lot of different places because so much is still to be decided as playtest proceeds, it will be interesting to see how it all solidifies and what the game becomes "about." It seems like a very exciting process and creative endeavor so far and think it's be able to create a very interesting story so far. <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/> Paul's got some really noval mechanics and ideas in it; I especially like one called the "claim" mechanic, that I will go into more when I do a write up. <br/><br/>Anyway, back to <b>Directions Storyplaying System</b>. I think anyone interested in playing GMless Story Games should give it a read. I've browsed it, and it seems like it will lead to some novel perspectives on design upon reading, if my impressions are correct.<br/><br/>I just have one question BeePeeGee, are you going commit your game to print? Must...Collect...All...Games. Preferably in print.

I really want to see what <i>Inconceivable! </i>developes into organically through play.

("Story Bones" was one, I believe, for example.)<br/><br/><i>Storifier</i> is cool. You could use that formula to combine the word "Story" with various suffixes. ("Storytrix?") How about "Storyfall", even? <br/><br/>If you end using a metaphor to anchor your various ritual phrases and/or themes around, however, that would make for a far more memorable and inspiring title! Ultimately, "Story [anything]" is pretty bland and uninspiring.<br/><br/>I'd say figure out what's special or unique about your game and make a title out of that. "Generic and bland" isn't a great way to get people's attention or to be memorable.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464630/#Comment_464630" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-05T23:07:55+00:00" title="July  5, 2017 11:07PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah.

Still generic as a game, but with its own memorable presentation style.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464724/#Comment_464724" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-08T18:45:45+00:00" title="July  8, 2017  6:45PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Exactly.

I definitely want to explore the idea of framing ritual phrases with the mythology, to see if it might make my goals in that arena easier to achieve, by making it less personal and, as you suggested, by seemingly distancing the players roles when using the ritual words for disruptions in tone, verisimilitude and coherence. I'm not sure what the best way to frame this would be or what ritual phrases would be the best. I'm not sure about saying something like: "Penelope does not approve of...;" in other words, I'm not sure about the idea of pretending like it's Penelope's perspective\u2014 however, I do like the idea of the ritual phrases being allegorical (metaphors based on the  Penelope story), and at once, referring to the mythology while enacting the phrases design purposes. Basically, I like all the ideas you mentioned, Paul;  I wouldn't mind having a more in-depth discussion about it,  when we can discuss both  <b>Inconceivable! </b>and <b>Penelope's Loom</b>, so my game isn't taking all the air up in the room.<br/>Maybe a ritual phrase like\u2026<br/>"Do you think the color of that thread matches the others?"<br/>... this could be used if something doesn't feel on to tone, for example <br/><br/>I really like where you're going with the ritual phrases you suggested above. The drawing of colored threads a cool idea; unfortunately, there's no drawing of color tokens or threads or anything else in <b>Penelope's Loom</b>. It's not based on the ideas I was playing with in that bead thread, but I like the image. Thanks for your post, Paul. It was very thought-provoking, and I think it's a cool direction to go in. <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/> <br/><br/>I need a phrase for:<br/>1. Breaking tone<br/>2. Breaking verisimilitude <br/>3. Something that is hard to say\u2014making the story hard to bring back together or introducing something that makes the story inconsistent or incoherent as a whole...I don't know really how to sum it up in a concise, understandable way yet, I'm not exactly sure what I'm trying to say specifically, but I have seen, whatever this is, create an unsatisfying story and make it almost impossible to create a satisfying end to the story...it's like introducing something that just makes everything fall apart and not work, and then everything becomes a bunch of pieces that are almost impossible to put back together again...I don't know, "Introducing an Incoherent Element into the Story" is probably the best way to put it.<br/> <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

The two that I think have something to contribute here are Archipelago. The Destiny Points help the story to have direction, remaining coherent and coming to a satisfying conclusion. Evidently, you are (or, should be) playing and advocating for your character which I think is not exactly what you're like king for.<br/><br/>The game I think best fits the bill might be Universalis which is fairly old now and I read it many years ago. In that game, you don't really control a specific character, the mechanics mostly play with the authority toward adding elements to the story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/paganini" title="paganini"><img alt="paganini" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/paganini">paganini</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465965/#Comment_465965" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-28T16:11:49+00:00" title="August 28, 2017  4:11PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, Universalis for sure.

I could have sworn I posted them to this thread already, but I guess not. <br/><br/>Universalis is a great one to study, because it does not actually do the job in the original question super well. That is, when you play Uni, unless everyone is very tight with their challenges, you end up with weird mishmashes of genre tropes. <br/><br/>SOAP! is just... everyone should play SOAP! at least once. It's one of those games that creates anecdotes you still talk about 20 years later.
