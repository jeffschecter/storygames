But it is not Zen.<br/><br/>The moderation team here likes to refer to the "zen" of Story Games. As far as I can tell, what this seems to mean is something akin to "peace" or "calm", presumably the sense of the word "zen" you'd extract from the kind of tabletop "zen gardens" beloved of executives with huge desks.<br/><br/>Zen is not about peace or calm. Zen is about the achievement of enlightenment. This may <i>involve</i> an environment characterised by peace and calm. But it may also involve other things. Notably, it often involves being confronted with things that alarm and perplex you, in the hope this will lead you to the abandonment of previously fixed ideas.<br/><br/>In this sense, Story Games is very not-Zen.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376411/#Comment_376411" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-04T12:15:10+00:00" title="May  4, 2012 12:15PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am alarmed and perplexed frequently by Story Games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376415/#Comment_376415" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-04T12:48:36+00:00" title="May  4, 2012 12:48PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 4, 2012 12:49PM by RobMcDiarmid.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In zen meditation, the student may be struck with the keisaku to shock them into wakeful practice and encourage them on the road to enlightenment. The jikijitsu strikes the student, not to relieve themselves of their own anger and frustration, but as a tool of guidance for the student.<br/><br/>In this way, shock, alarm, and perplexion may be offered to the learner, as a tool for their benefit, while still retaining one's personal inner calm. <br/><br/>Even anger and frustration can be used as tools of instruction, when the instructor maintains control of their own anger and frustration, rather than letting the anger and frustration control them. This is a difficult instruction technique to learn, and generally requires building a level of trust over time between the instructor and student before it can be used effectively.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376418/#Comment_376418" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-04T12:51:08+00:00" title="May  4, 2012 12:51PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 4, 2012 12:52PM by Andy.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Please take a look at my response to the call for Open Moderation here (where I confirm to move forward with openness in some respects, but reiterate why I'm not going to open all aspects):<br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=16442&amp;page=2" rel="nofollow">http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=16442&amp;page=2</a><br/><br/>S-G isn't itself Zen. <br/><br/>"The Zen" was essentially shorthand for "don't engage in shitty human behaviors", stuff like name-calling (in the very early days I said "name calling is AWESOME!", but then again in those days literally there were like 80 members who all knew each other and were mostly friends, so name-calling was always friend-to-friend; we're way beyond that now), bullying, threatening, etc. It didn't mean "don't discuss things critically", "don't talk about things that can alarm people": some folks took this to mean "you can't discuss racism at S-G because it threatens white people, and thus messes with the Zen"; in actuality, the way it always happens is "you can't discuss racism at S-G meaningfully because adults--including capital-A Allies--on both sides often suddenly start acting like fucking children to each other, flipping off their Empathy switch in order to out-insult each other or count coup through sarcastic barbs to win at bullshit social games". \u898b\u82e6\u3057\u3044<br/><br/>It's difficult. And I've realized recently that "The Zen" is either going to be broken down in "what I actually mean by it", with the term either encompassing that, or simply abandoning the term altogether.<br/><br/>I'm actually doing a lot of deconstruction on this now myself. I just got back yesterday from a month of working in Japan (and away from my family); the last week I spent by myself in Kamakura--<b>literally the birthplace of Zen Buddhism</b>--and spent a lot of personal time at some of the off-the-beaten-path temples and the like. I don't like using words like life-changing, but I definitely now have *something* in my head that's trying to work itself out, especially in how I work and talk with others, in person and online, and potential lessons to be applied to this place.<br/><br/>It will take a while, though. But I've got friends interested in seeing the results, so there we go.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376420/#Comment_376420" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-04T12:59:34+00:00" title="May  4, 2012 12:59PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            About "harshing the zen", it's an old phrase of Andy's (and of similar new age hipsters in general, of course), he's been using it since he started the forum. If there's some ideology there, it's informalism: instead of trying to set in stone a bunch of ever more detailed laws, Andy just has this idea of a nice and positive environment for people to encounter each other in; whatever contributes to this environment is "zen" in a very ironically distanced choice of words. I find it an effective choice of words for myself, as I read it as a hipster self-ironic tone - he knows that he's not laying out law, but rather just using a gut-check, and he calls his gut "zen".<br/><br/>I admit that I find the above feature of Story Games annoying myself when it makes the moderation feel weak on the face of aggression, causing it to buckle basically because Andy doesn't want to take sides for right or wrong - whatever choice amounts to least amount of public argument goes, and this is usually some variant on "you guys stop engaging each other now or my dinner party is ruined". I don't pretend to have a better general strategy, though, considering the goals and nature of Story Games; we all would obviously love it if everybody felt like coming to <i>our</i> forums where all social engineering solutions would obviously be so perfect and never flawed, but that's freedom of congregation for you - apparently we prefer Andy's solution more than the alternatives available in the marketplace of ideas. I know that his approach has been very successful in creating an environment where most people most of the time don't feel a need to carry on grudges or congragate into permanent cliques; either he's attracting relatively mature people (perhaps because of the Forge backstory involved here), or the forum management strategy somehow causes people to act more sensibly than your average forum clusterfuck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376424/#Comment_376424" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-04T13:07:14+00:00" title="May  4, 2012  1:07PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thomas,<br/><br/>You seem to think it's your duty to confront people, angrily, whenever you think they're wrong. <br/><br/>That's fine, but could you find another forum to do it on?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376438/#Comment_376438" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-04T14:25:17+00:00" title="May  4, 2012  2:25PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I absolutely do think that's my duty, yes.<br/><br/>So far as I can carry on that duty within the bounds of this forum's moderation, I'll continue to do so until the moderators tell me to stop.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376439/#Comment_376439" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-04T14:31:29+00:00" title="May  4, 2012  2:31PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a bit curious about your duty, Thomas.

I'm hugely confrontational myself, but try to be polite and understanding towards the people I confront. For the most part we get along well enough with most people here despite my being only too willing to disagree, but I can only imagine that I'd be tolerated much less if I was spiteful about arguing.

Anger is often justified.

A lot of people thanked me for raising the original thread. And I think that a lot of people were at least made to think about race issues as a result, whatever they concluded.<br/><br/>Are there people who end up being against my point of view who might haver been in favour of it had I expressed myself in different terms? Maybe. It's often a calculation with discussions like these as to how much effort is worth putting in. I have put in a lot of effort, at other times, in places not here, to contort myself and comport myself along with whatever value system the person I am attempting to persuade views as necessary. It's rarely proved to be worth it.\n<blockquote><br/>What would you lose by being less rude or less angry?</blockquote>\nIt isn't a choice, how angry to be. Sure, I can aim to post while I am in a good mood, and have calmed down as much as possible. But I am still going to be as angry as I am about the problem I perceive.<br/><br/>As for rudeness, with regard to the problems I am talking about, it is literally impossible to do certain things without being, by the standards here, rude. For example, if I want to say that something someone said is racist, I can't say that without being impolite.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376460/#Comment_376460" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-04T15:19:07+00:00" title="May  4, 2012  3:19PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm. I don't know if you're interested in advice or the like, but this being a semi-free forum I'll throw in my own viewpoint: for me participating here at Story Games ranks about as seriously on the life scales as e.g. watching a movie - I do both mostly as a relaxing pastime when winding down from creative work or such. This means that the most upset I can get over this is when people are being really annoying, but even then it's pretty far cry from being angry. Lots of actually serious things in my life, as I imagine others have, too. For this reason being nice ranks pretty high for me in my forum participation: the stakes here are basically high enough for people to get frustrated and sad over what I say, and if we're fortunate somebody (perhaps us, perhaps some other reader) will learn something from the discourse. In this kind of environment the only moral goods available are human respect and truth/beauty of ideas. I'll go for the truth/beauty myself, many others will go for being nice first, but the vast majority of time there is no conflict between these values whatsoever, so we can be both truthful and nice at the same time.<br/><br/>Reflecting on the above, and remembering that anger can be rightly construed as simple passion for the subject matter, I'd say that being angry about a topic is OK as long as it's socially responsible and constructive towards the topic. I think that people find being passionate about a topic easier to take when the intense passion or anger is clearly directed at the subject matter and not at other people. My own impression is that I'd have been forbidden from discussing D&amp;D over the last few months if merely being passionate and absolutist about a topic were enough to be socially unacceptable, that's how fundamentalist I currently am about it <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> Fortunately the vast majority of topics are such that nobody feels like I'm threatening their personal identity by being intent upon figuring out the truth about it. Some are, and that's when I get forumarily moderated, too.<br/><br/>Also, it goes without saying that respect begets receptive audiences. This alone is a good reason to keep a calm head even when driven by passion. The (admittedly European, probably racist) ideal forum citizen since when talks were held on actual agoras has always been one who has great passions, but also controls them well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pigeon" title="pigeon"><img alt="pigeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pigeon">pigeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376461/#Comment_376461" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-04T15:20:50+00:00" title="May  4, 2012  3:20PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are quite a few people in the various racism threads we've had who have been pretty rude on the "racism is awesome" side of the fence, but the only people who've received public approbation for their behavior are the people who are against racism.

And in general, it seems that public warning mainly happen after repeated private communications have failed. <br/><br/>In general this is a potential issue with private vs. public warnings. Private warnings create uncertainty and make it unclear what's happening and what behavior is accepted vs. not.

What they usually say is: they hate these threads. They don't want to go near them. That, they say, is why they don't post in them.<br/><br/>This is what worries me about these threads. I understand the urge to call out racism and sexism. I really do: I've done it myself, loudly, and made myself unpopular doing it. But, when the threads get nasty, the people that are most important to the topic don't post. The privileged voices - and we must acknowledge that's what we are - shout loudly and the minority voices don't get heard.<br/><br/>So that's the thing. There's a reason these threads are dominated by white men. It's because, even though we're talking about privilege, we get sucked into posting in a privileged, gendered way. That's what we need to be careful of.<br/><br/>(If I'm misrepresenting anyone's experience, please do tell me.

Go back and look at those threads. There are a plethora of people of color in those threads -- on one side of the discussion. The other side, not so much.<br/><br/>edit: There are some people of color I know who definitely didn't post in those threads, just as there are some women I know who never post in threads about racism. The thing is, though, these people don't post on Story Games at ALL any more.

The entire idea that a thing was sexist or not sexist was thrown out in favor of trying to make individuals make up with other individuals.<br/>        - Tangent: I was personally attacked in a thread like this, and I got a whisper from a moderator saying "Wow, that guy's being a jerk, I told him to wrap it up." Not "I shut down the thread." I told him to wrap it up. "It" being the attacks on me. Wind 'em down! Get out those last jabs.<br/><br/>- The sheer amount of casual racism and sexism is overwhelming to me. I came in to the thread Tom started because it started out with such promise. I tried to talk from a place of experience. Then people saying incredibly racist things came in and started shouting. People who called out the problematic content of these posts were shouted down. People who posted the problematic content played the victim. For perhaps the tenth time since I began posting at Story Games, I asked myself if I wanted to spend my time in a place where it was so very important to be polite while people say intensely problematic things. A place where trying to stay neutral and "zen" means turning a blind eye to really terrible stuff. But hey, what do I know, right? I'm a shrill shrilly shrillypants who makes bad people feel bad about themselves and I'm probably on my period, right? <br/><br/>Of course I don't go into these threads. Or anywhere on Story Games.

And that's from somebody who almost certainly is counted in the ranks of the oppressors in this particular ideological framework. As I said earlier, though, I don't know that it'd be possible to fix this phenomenon without compromising on the things Andy clearly values the most here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376533/#Comment_376533" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-04T20:25:40+00:00" title="May  4, 2012  8:25PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 4, 2012 8:37PM by UserClone.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Guys, is it really that difficult to just illustrate to someone that you find something that they've said to be crass or offensive for whichever reason it happens to be, without making it a personal attack, without snarking it up, and without basically screaming in their faces about it? I mean, for example, Lula has jokes for days, but they don't seem mean-spirited so much as they seem to be an attempt to show someone what it is they are doing (eg the post about Jenskot being an articulate, clean white role model, over in the Steampunk Musha thread. I can understand being angry, even being filled with rage. But here's the rub: You are in a discussion forum, not a shouting match. If what you have to say probably doesn't qualify as "discussion," does it really have a place here? A lot of these posts feel like they should be blog posts, not forum posts in a place where people are trying to engage in public discourse. Another poster said it best, I think:<br/><br/>SGer A:<br/>A lot of people here have issues: Emotional issues, personal issues, issues of physical and mental illness, issues of trauma, issues that influence or taint their discussions. Some people are simply cruel or spiteful, and just want to take the tools of Safety, of Inclusion, and pervert them to Silence others and score points in little bullshit status games (and by this I mean some of the people "on our side", speaking out against sexism, racism, etc; not Trolls, which are pretty easy to spot). Some people want to be shrill and be heard, and don't want to listen to others. Some people are baffled by issues that others have internalized to heart, so when they address them (attempting to use understanding and empathy) they don't tread softly, and cause a stir.<br/><br/>SGer B (to A):<br/>Fundamentally, I don't see it this way at all. To my mind, the situation is a lot clearer and less nuanced and complex than you are making it out to be. I suspect fundamentally assumptions about what is and isn't good discourse are at play and there's simply a mismatch going on between what I'd like the ethos of this place to be and what it actually is.<br/><br/>Myself:<br/>Actually, I think that SGer A's assessment here is spot-on. I also happen to completely agree with everything about the third sentence of your response, and would like to put the second sentence reversed back to you. Race relations is never, ever a simple issue, because there are always varying levels of awareness, ignorance, social conditioning, standoffishness, trollishness, heads butting, empathy, intuitiveness, and obliviousness, among other factors, that get in the way of the simple truth that, while we're all different, we're all equally deserving of respect.<br/><br/>EDIT:<br/><br/>This also seems particularly relevant.<br/><br/>First, the MISSION STATEMENT for this site:<br/>This site is a place to loosely describe Role Playing Games.

The approach has some advantages and disadvantages, but one of the advantages is that it counteracts the <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/19" rel="nofollow">Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory</a> because we're often habituated to using etiquette and sensitivity when we're sitting in a room at a party, in a way we're not on the Internet. For me personally, it forces me to assert myself in a restrained manner about topics which I can get crazy over (like racism), as well as reminding me when I am actually in a physical room at an actual party that I should assert myself about topics which I can easily pretend I don't care about in the name of keeping the social peace (like racism).<br/><br/>Story-Games is particularly weird for me because people tend to have huge, significant fights in topics I didn't read. Story-Games isn't unique in that sense\u2014I mean, I post on the White Wolf forums from time to time, albeit mostly as a sort of troll\u2014but in the room-full-of-people model, which I'm more likely to use here given the number of people I know or know someone who knows IRL, it makes me feel like there's loads of important, meaningful, impactful history that I missed and that I need to educate myself about so I can understand why people are staring daggers at each other. For example, Elizabeth states up there that most serious topics here make her feel unwelcome, which is a huge thing about how people are treating each other, hard to ignore even if you're not connected thereto. So I should go read those topics, right? The same way I would ask a friend who's visibly upset what they're upset about?<br/><br/>Where this ramble intersects with this actual thread is, on the axis of let's-be-polite-and-restrained versus let's-highlight-the-truth-in-everything-for-great-justice, I'm not really sure how to respond to those huge important things that happened just outside of my experience. Isn't it polite and restrained to understand and respect someone's feelings if they're upset? Isn't it forthright and righteous to champion being nice to each other even if you have to sacrifice some of what you want personally? It's hard for me to find out without seeing myself through others' eyes.<br/><br/>Not that it would matter especially much, because everything I say is fair and balanced and you're all wrong, but, y'know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376540/#Comment_376540" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-04T22:00:01+00:00" title="May  4, 2012 10:00PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 4, 2012 10:06PM by Andy.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (EDIT: Crossposted, I was responding to Userclone, re posting the rules and guidelines of the site)<br/><br/>At the same time, while at the time those rules were conceived they worked, there's lots of new people, new viewpoints, new representations of race gender nationality, and not everyone is an Old Forge hand. They worked when the forum was small, everyone knew each other, everyone had a pretty common definition of "what is shitty human behavior, and what isn't?", and pretty similar political stances and backgrounds (read, mostly Americans, Canadians and some UKers). <br/><br/>It's no longer the case, and I honestly see that the lack of clarity on matters is causing harm, particularly on issues of "ism"s. I don't want to maintain a space where people can say shitty things with impunity, while the people who call out shitty behavior (harshly, perhaps, as humans slip sometimes) get called out. <br/><br/>So we're currently thinking of rules to change and clarify, methods of moderation to pursue (protip: no single method is Corrent; there are flaws in all, but we'll see what we can do), and getting a lot of feedback from current and former members in order to build that kind of place. I really see ties to Google Plus or the like as necessary at times to continue discussions that get... let's call it "unsafe"; while at the same time not marking all "uncomfortable/challenging" topics as "unsafe", and certainly not allowing for non-Allies to force us to pull the "unsafe" lever because they want to sabotage such a thread with bullshit.<br/><br/>It's not going to be easy, and it sure as shit isn't going to be quick. <br/><br/>So I appreciate the support! <br/><br/>At the same time, it's been clear for a while that it's time to restructure and clarify a bit (well, more than A Bit). I've now got four friends to help push that wheel, and a lot of other folks interested in offering advice on how to do so. We're listening to it all.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>-Andy<br/><br/>---<br/>footnote, this was originally above the "It's not going to be easy" line. Hopefully it explains a little more detail about some fears re the site:<br/><br/><sub>(((At the same time, my greatest fear about attempting to create a "safe space" is the very thing I've watched sink other online safe spaces, one right after another, anywhere from two months to two years until utter implosion and bitterness for all involved: That some people (and-surprisingly-here I mean folks who are traditionally Allies, and not Trolls) are far more interested in personal status/bullshit status games, dominance or control over others, facilitating personal grudges and power plays, the capital-S Silencing of all who disagree with or whom they have a grudge against, etc; ...by using the very Safe Space forum tools created for Safety, Inclusion, Understanding and Sharing as weapons to be used for facilitating those despicable behaviors.<br/>I bring up that point a lot here and there, because it is very much an issue I feel strongly about; especially after having seen time and time again people put hard work into meaningfully creating what they think are utopias, only to have shitty, bitter or ill people wreck it for personal satisfaction or status.<br/>It happened to dozens of sites and communities, but particularly to one site I believed in and followed daily; I watched it crumble and turn toxic because some people found a way to twist tools to their own ends. And the implosion of that site created arguments, resentments and fights over here on S-G which lasted about two full years. Literally almost every single moderation action here for two full years was due to a fight that started on another site (whisper: "Yeah, sure, I was yelling at this person disrespectfully, but only because they said X to me over on that other site!" etc). <br/>So yeah, that's like my "nightmare scenario", something that's probably kept me too slow to enact change, but at the same time something that's haunted me enough to make sure that this place doesn't become that, in a very real "I will shut it down before that happens" way.)))</sub> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376546/#Comment_376546" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-05T00:02:07+00:00" title="May  5, 2012 12:02AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero and Thomas, and probably others:<br/><br/>You talk about "truth" vs "politeness". One of the things I admire about you, Eero, is how you go for logic and reason when making your arguments and stating your position. However, I don't believe in "truth" the way you do, maybe. To me, most "truths" about social things - like game rules, or gender, or race, or values - are situated and local and personal. <br/><br/>Going into a discussion with an aim to fight for the truth is something I, personally, try to do with my eyes open, as I know from experience that my truths change over time and I sometimes disagree with my previous truths. Trying to make others understand the truth, then, is a futile exercise. <br/><br/>I like having people agree with me, because that's nice. I have to admit that the older I get, the more I just enjoy the positive social things about fora and discussion. Making someone smile, or showing them something they didn't know, or having them publicly aknowledge that I said something good or smart or whatever. However, winning a battle of truth definition isn't so much where I'm coming from.

I don't want to maintain a space where people can say shitty things with impunity, while the people who call out shitty behavior (harshly, perhaps, as humans slip sometimes) get called out.<br/><br/>So we're currently thinking of rules to change and clarify, methods of moderation to pursue (protip: no single method is Corrent; there are flaws in all, but we'll see what we can do), and getting a lot of feedback from current and former members in order to build that kind of place.</blockquote>I think there's some value in a little more visibility in moderator activity on the contentious threads, particularly when a thread is being closed down.  (Although, there are extremes where<a href="http://publicaddress.net/up-front/the-up-front-guides-all-things-in-moderation/" rel="nofollow">it's not helpful</a> to go too far in the other direction.  There's one forum I know where the policies are very strict, right down to lists of banned words, and saying things like "I think concept X is stupid" gets little public telling-offs from the moderators (because it's ableism).  But it didn't in fact make the board feel like a friendly place, even though a big goal of the forum was to be a 'safe space', because there were a lot of people who were articulate enough to keep inside the guidelines but liked being snarky and sarcastic, and that was OK in the group vibe.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>From time to time, I talk to female and black friends about the argumentative threads on Story Games.

I did participate in one of those 'ism' threads one time, but quickly found that I was there as a 'person with ovaries', which meant being used as an example by people on one side of the conversation, and having my opinion (and supporting evidence) dismissed out of hand by a person on the other side who was repeatedly saying that the opinions of more women were needed in the discussion.  That was a bit alienating.  As for the rest of the ism threads -  I've looked at them, but after the first page of posts it's just the same arguments going around and around and around, particularly after people start making personal attacks.  After that, there isn't much worth saying unless you like feeling angry.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376575/#Comment_376575" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-05T08:31:36+00:00" title="May  5, 2012  8:31AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>Going into a discussion with an aim to fight for the truth is something I, personally, try to do with my eyes open, as I know from experience that my truths change over time and I sometimes disagree with my previous truths.

For myself, I've long ago abandoned this entire framework of understanding a forum encounter exclusively as an opportunity to convince others of this or that. The one you join a discourse for is <i>yourself</i>, and you're the one who needs to learn from what you participate in. Or rather, to be entirely exact: the process of discourse, when engaged with rational purity, should benefit <i>everybody</i> participating in it with intellectual honesty. The point is not to sermonize others about "the truth", but rather to lay out the subject matter for consideration, joining your wisdom to others so that the truth might emerge from the meeting of the minds. Without this feature of learning just about my only motivation for participating at a public forum like this would be to throw in a marketing message when I've got something new to sell.<br/><br/>Dogmatism and anger can be very counter-productive from this viewpoint, which is why some people calling for various sorts of social justice seem to easily annoy me in turn. Mostly they don't seem to be engaging in good faith, they already have a dogma and they're in the conversation to manipulate others emotionally into submitting to their point of view. I don't understand why somebody wants to participate in a discussion on a discussion forum or even start one if their attitude is that they're too busy and tired of it all to engage with differing viewpoints. You'll be called names and accused of various metaphorical acts of violence unless you submit rhetorically, and attempts to discuss the matter substantially (who, what, why, how, whatever) are brushed aside on essentialist grounds. ("Essentialism", an intellectual framework wherein complex phenomena are attributed to simple causes. Racism and sexism are examples, and apparently American anti-racists are also routinely simple thinkers for whom the world can basically be explained by dividing it into racists and people who agree with you.) While all this might seem very noble from the viewpoint of this particular set of moral values, it runs directly counter to another sphere of ethics, so it's no wonder if I'm intrigued and even upset by these topics. From my viewpoint it's clear who the bad guys are in these discussions - they're the people who bully others into silence and compliance without being willing to uphold an open and trust-based discussion environment. Discourse degenerates when you start to feel that you're in a debate with hateful enemies, and that you can't share your experiences and thoughts honestly because they'll be mocked and discarded on essentialist grounds. (Say, because you're what an American categorizes as white male, and dare to have an opinion that is different from somebody else's.)<br/><br/>If it's not clear from the above, by the way, I'm not discussing only one or the other side of the race debate you're having. I'm not discussing the substantial issue at all, as far as I'm concerned. (Whether you believe me is another thing - I've noticed a marked tendency for the people most dogmatic about this race thing to simply attribute discussion-technical commentary as a cunning white man's ploy for silencing people without having to outright say that it's really because of how racist they are.) I'm just telling about how the engagement of some people looks like sometimes, and why I think it's problematic. There are people much too trollish and dogmatic on both sides of difficult disputes, no doubt, even if in this case the impression I'm left with is that the social justice side has a slight lead on the rhetorical stupidity. Perhaps that's the abstract privilege they talk about in action - I somehow don't notice it when the racist conspiracy is impolite, or it's easier for the white man to be polite and reasonable.<br/><br/>So from my viewpoint I'd have to say that the vast majority of time truth and politeness as virtues support each other: a truthful process requires trust and respect. As I said earlier I'll go for the truth when and if a choice has to be made, but as a matter of process I don't see these two virtues as opposed. Rather, what seems opposed to both truth and virtue in difficult forum discourses is uncaring intellectual hubris: people troll and bait and write clever putdowns, refusing to engage others in good faith; they push their dogma, apparently in an attempt to convert others by sheer force of social pressure; they ignore and hurt others emotionally and say it's for a good cause. As far as I'm concerned this is acting directly in opposition to a discussion forum's purpose, so the logical thing to do is to decide what it is that's even attempted here: is this a place where people engage each other's viewpoints in discussion, or is this a place where the bestest people tell others how to live. The dogmatic and intellectually dishonest discourse tactics would be right at home in the latter kind of place.<br/><br/>As a conclusion I might offer the thought that if we are to take a discussion forum as a discussion forum and not a training camp for ideologues, then maybe the problem we're observing here could be fixed by not mixing the currents. Hey Andy, an idea: what if the forum procedure worked in a way where meta-discourses about how people should engage each other were explicitly removed from the forums into some more private channel where moderators ponder things? Basically, it seems to me that we run into nasty arguments when people feel so strongly about social justice that they try to fix the forum environment by directly training the forum population. This causes two modes of communication to clash, as people requesting respect and honest debate get in the way of the sermon. I think the sermon would be more effective, too, if it was directed primarily at the forum sysop, who could then take what steps he feels necessary to fix things with authority - if people are being oppressed at the forum, I think that talking about it is not the right thing to do, when you could be using dictatorial fiat to fix things.<br/><br/>(Just a brainstorm: what if there was a blog on the front page of the site, and people could submit essays to the moderation to be published there without direct discussion from the forum population? This would enable a person who thinks that people need to be taught to say their piece in a prominent place <i>without</i> directly inviting discussion. It seems to me that people like myself are directly contributing to social tension by trying to discuss these interesting social justice topics, so somehow removing them from the realm of discourse into the realm of pedagogy could be a powerful means of simply ensuring that we don't get mixed up in this stuff. I mean, I'm not stupid - tell me that I shouldn't participate in something, and I won't.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376576/#Comment_376576" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-05T08:48:47+00:00" title="May  5, 2012  8:48AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep.<br/><br/>I wish I had more to add, Eero, but all I can do is read and re-read what you've just typed, nod slowly, and type the word Yep.<br/><br/>Actually, I will say this: I avoid communication/interaction with racists. And homophobes. And angry/shrill people, or those who employ ad hominem attacks, or those who accuse me falsely.

A failure to encourage politeness and respect usually results in a cesspool, and I have abandoned a lot of forums because of this tendency. I haven't done a lot of SG posting over the past few years because of the zenharshing that I've experienced, but it seems like there's this new effort to get the place in order, and I applaud it.<br/><br/>I have no problem with different viewpoints, as long as they're not abusive or flat-out insulting (for example, I was pleased to see Andy straighten SentientGames out when the latter asserted that there's nothing racist about the term oriental -- I mean, come on, that statement was just wrong, and it needed to be moderated, and so it was, and that's a good thing).<br/><br/>Sermons, or whatever you want to call them, are fine with me, so long as they're kept out of threads pertaining to game development or play.

Shreyas trolls - his posts look just like that, he snipes cleverly at somebody and then what, goes out for tea with his homies and laughs at how clever his put-down was. That's the impression I get, at least from how he acts, he doesn't think much of saying upsetting things at others in the Internet without respecting them enough to explain himself or listen to counter-arguments. He's said plenty of nasty things to me over the years, for example, apparently impulsively. I'll shrug and bear it, but I don't respect him for how caring about others is apparently only reserved for his friends.<br/><br/>I'd like to think that I at least take the time to establish what I really think, and establish that I'm willing to discuss the issue in length - a meeting of minds instead of a drive-by snipe. Of course you can edit down what I wrote into some snappy snapping, but doesn't it matter at all what <i>else</i> I wrote? I mean, does the fact that I have the wrong opinions mean more than the fact that I'm willing to let others disagree and I'll listen to others? I can understand that it's most annoying that I might think e.g. that American anti-racists seem to be locked down into essentialist thinking; is your problem with forum discourse truly that I might hold this opinion? You're not happy unless I think differently, and what I say on other things would be better left unsaid if it's accompanied by my wrong opinions?<br/><br/>The way I'd like for discourse to work, provided others are willing, is that we could disagree even on important issues and even long-term, but agree on the idea that ultimately saying those ideas is better than staying silent, and learning from others and honing your own thinking thereby is the ultimate fruit of discourse. Intellectual humility, respect for others - I could list a lot of buzzwords for what I'm talking about, but ultimately it boils down to one question: assuming that I am say a racist, am I allowed to express this position in discussion, or are my alternatives only to either shut up or change my opinion (let's pretend that's something you can do)? If having the wrong opinions is in itself unacceptable, then I don't think we can truthfully say that we have a discussion; it's something else, whether a public humiliation or a sermon or whatever.<br/><br/>(To clarify, I don't want to say that a real discussion forum needs to allow anybody to say anything or it's not a real discussion. I don't want to hold a prejudice against sermons or social taboos or such, you can quite easily set down ground-rules for discussion. But then I'd like them to be real ground-rules, I don't think it's upright intellectually to pressure others into following your dogma with e.g. social ostracism. It'd be better to convince Andy to put up a set of accepted premises that are not allowed to be questioned. Just like a Christian discussion board might quite reasonably decide that the community doesn't want to spend all of its time arguing about the verity of their shared faith, I think it's entirely reasonable if we set up a rule wherein people are not allowed to question say social justice dogma on the forums. Might well the quickest route to the calm and peaceful cohabitation Andy likes, now that I think about it.)<br/><br/>For myself, I've long ago made peace with the fact that there are people who have different opinions out there. ("Somebody's being wrong in the Internet!" as the saying goes.) I can take that without distress. For example, I'm willing to entertain the notion that my thinking might be racist as some people on this forum understand the term. As far as I'm concerned this is not a <i>problem</i>, it's just a feature of the world. What do you think, Liam, do you feel differently? Is it a problem that somebody disagrees with your dearly held convictions? I think that this is something that would need to be established before we could see eye to eye on the details. Ideally I'd love it if the people who are uncomfortable with sharing a forum with racists and sexists could see it as a long-term intellectual challenge and a spice of life. Sort of like how I'm friends with many Christians despite having some pretty strong anti-Christian opinions myself, to pick an example from my own life. If this basic requirement of acceptance and respect couldn't be upheld, then I think it'd be better to limit the forum only to right-thinking people, or change its nature from a place of discourse into a place where people are taught about how wrong they are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376581/#Comment_376581" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-05T10:04:44+00:00" title="May  5, 2012 10:04AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To clarify on the above, I haven't gotten the impression that Liam is particularly rude or disrespectful of other people.

I'm discussing forum debate technique first and racist bias second, while Liam up there opened by questioning whether racists and anti-racists are held to the same standards of behaviour here. Connected issues, but not quite the same - if it's a question as to whether everybody should be respectful towards others, I think we'd agree on that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pigeon" title="pigeon"><img alt="pigeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pigeon">pigeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376582/#Comment_376582" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-05T10:08:23+00:00" title="May  5, 2012 10:08AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2012 10:16AM by pigeon.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>I'd like to think that I at least take the time to establish what I really think, and establish that I'm willing to discuss the issue in length - a meeting of minds instead of a drive-by snipe.

They were characterizations of the worst facets I'm seeing in this discussion. For example, when some people in that coyote thread dismissed other people's opinions because those other people were white men, that was essentialist thinking - reverse racism, if you please, addressing identity politics instead of the substance of the matter. It was not you I was talking about; as I mention above, I can't remember you participating in any but exemplary ways in these discussions. I wouldn't mind talking race relations with you all week, seems like it would be time well spent.<br/><br/>In general, for those reading and wondering whether we might be talking about them personally - I don't think that's a very important issue to distinguish who might have said what in some heated discussion thread. The general principles of good discourse are more important. I mean, sure, we could go nitpick individual exchanges and analyze who's being a good sport and who's being stupid, but that'd only be useful for putting people into further boxes. The fact is, most people I meet are far from perfect, and we'll do stupid things now and then.

I really do: I've done it myself, loudly, and made myself unpopular doing it. But, when the threads get nasty, the people that are most important to the topic don't post. The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">privileged</span> voices - and we must acknowledge that's what we are - shout loudly and the minority voices don't get heard.<br/><br/>So that's the thing. There's a reason these threads are dominated by white men. It's because, even though we're talking about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">privilege</span>, we get sucked into posting in a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">privileged</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">gendered</span> way. That's what we need to be careful of.</blockquote>\n<br/>Graham says the urge to call out racism and sexism can actually chase away the same people it was intended to benefit, because they may prefer to avoid calling-out conversations &amp; the ensuing responses.<br/><br/>That's a difficult paradox.  It seems he's aware that 'we had to burn the village to save it' is a counterproductive approach.<br/><br/>But then, Graham then drops the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">p-bomb</span> 3 times &amp; pulls the pin on a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">gendered</span>. (With a strongly implied 'silencing' to boot.)<br/><br/>For me, that's a mindfuck.   Because those terms often are the tools of a line-in-the-sand, all-or-nothing, you're-either-with-us-or-against-us ideology.<br/>Drop those bombs, and the conversation is effectively over... with only room for "Is not!" "Is Too!" "Is Not!" "Is Too!" go-nowhere noisemaking, afterward.   But Graham (and others who subscribe to that analysis) seem unlikely to abandon that ideology altogether, on the grounds that it's self-defeating. <br/><br/>The death of MCA is on my mind.  One of the most iconic Straight White Misogynist Male Cultural Appropriators of my generation, if viewed through an uncharitable ideological lens...   And also a notable example of growth &amp; enlightenment into a Buddhist voice against oppression in Tibet, as well as an anti-misogynist, and respectful honorer of Black culture-- if viewed charitably thru the same ideology.<br/><br/>But what about the possibility that there was nothing actually so bad about the 'bad', 'old' Beastie Boys?  When social conservatives Tipper Gore and Oprah denounced the group in 1986, Jello Biafra defended the Beasties' satire &amp; irony as valid forms of artistic critique: <span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-ZpUeo6wR7M4?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpUeo6wR7M4"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/ZpUeo6wR7M4/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span>   But, there's no room for alternate, also-progressive approaches in an ideology which defines all approaches outside its' orthodoxy as 'part of the problem', 'rape culture', 'racism is awesome', etc.<br/>I would offer MCA as a test case, as we consider what is &amp; isn't considered acceptable here at story games.  Would all versions of his persona be acceptable here?  Only the later version?  The-early-version-as-long-as-he-shows-progress?  No version?<br/><br/>And-- I can see having a problem with early-MCA on the grounds that he was a philistine: but I can only see that as socially conservative.  Because, if you believe in privilege, then isn't it classist &amp; elitist to despise philistines?<br/><br/>I know it is disheartening to hear "you made a wrong turn, waaaaaaay back at 'privilege'."  Especially from a lout like me.  But here's the good news: champions of progress existed before the sj ideology took current form, and before it became the dominant analysis.  And the pre-sj tools still work.  Plus, there IS still room for the newer analysis to be productive, as long as it's not this-or-nothing intolerance of dissenting allies.<br/><br/>I may be one of the few here to have attended Edward Said's lectures at Columbia, heard bell hooks in Harlem, Andrea Dworken in the West Village and at Sarah Lawrence.  I watched "Privilege is a Knapsack" morph from an <i>internal</i> admonishment from one privileged white woman professor, addressing younger versions of herself at Wellesley women's college-- regarding their own blindspots-- into Privilege as a critique today lobbed <i>externally</i> to assign blame outwardly.   <br/><br/>It would be easy to dismiss me as a straight white male angry at his privilege being threatened-- the sort of person Graham laments-- but you'd have to ignore what an insufferable <a href="http://fuckyeahsocialjusticesally.tumblr.com/" rel="nofollow">Sally</a> I recently was.  And you'd have to ignore the ways I'm not straight or white or privileged.  <br/><br/>Ultimately, I think it's futile (and offensive!) for any of you to pass judgement on whether I'm identity-correct enough to be afforded victim-status as an Oppressed, Native-American, Deaf, Trans*, Rape-Survivor; and we would be better off all regarding each other as potential MCAs in the making.<br/><br/>If that's not the moderation policy Story-Games adopts, so be it.  But at least this policy would have the advantage of not having to right all the worlds' wrongs BEFORE we allow everyone's identity be good-enough for their individual views to be given consideration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376597/#Comment_376597" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-05T12:26:09+00:00" title="May  5, 2012 12:26PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Todd L</cite>But, there's no room for alternate, also-progressive approaches in an ideology which defines all approaches outside its' orthodoxy as 'part of the problem', 'rape culture', 'racism is awesome', etc.</blockquote>\nThat doesn't exist, exactly 0 people are doing that or saying it's a good idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376601/#Comment_376601" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-05T13:13:17+00:00" title="May  5, 2012  1:13PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2012 1:14PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><br/>That doesn't exist, exactly 0 people are doing that or saying it's a good idea.</blockquote>\nI got curious enough, Jason, and skimmed that Coyote thread from the beginning. My theory was that it's not useful to count coup over who was the most stupid in aggregate, but rather I would see who goes stupid <i>first</i> and how. The theory being, stupidity breeds stupidity, and uncivil aggression will be answered in kind even by people who would ordinately act wisely. Perhaps if we understood how a discussion derails, it'll be easier to do our part in the future to maintain a high level. In part, I wanted to see if you're right in saying that Todd imagines a one-wayist ideological doctrine where there is none.<br/><br/>What I found was that the discussion thread was entirely civil until <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=375020" rel="nofollow">post <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2315&amp;Mode=like">#15</a></a>, in which Hans brushed off Tomas's observations (sincere opinions, if I'm any judge) with a snide remark about his privileged position. That's the sort of blow below the belt that were it directed at me, I'd be pretty pissed off at it - here this American asshole apparently thinks that he can categorize the entire rest of the world in his easy boxes, imposing his sick racial worldview on somebody who was just describing how his own background and experiences make him think on the subject matter of the thread. (I'm polishing the point to make it clearer how this entire thing might be viewed by somebody who has not integrated this American-originating privilege model in equality thinking - no idea how Tomas took it, although he did conduct himself pretty coolly in that discussion thread.)<br/><br/>Of course the discussion goes on after that, and we start seeing increasingly snide and thoughtless remarks from both "sides" of the discussion as more people are attracted to say their piece on the increasingly extreme claims presented - first as pointed queries and flat statements, then in increasing expressions of extreme support for some viewpoints, and finally as a meta-discourse on whether the other people in the thread were even discussing matters in good faith. (Most people, I should note, wrote mostly politely and reasonably in that thread, insofar as I'm any judge; it's just a few people who got incenced enough to cause a general atmosphere of incitement. I think it says very good things about this community's standards of discussion that we interrupted ourselves multiple times over the course of the discussion in attempts to build new basis for understanding, even if apparently we didn't get very far.) I did myself suggest to Tomas by whisper early on that he might want to simply let it go, as the discussion thread was full of people for whom it is very important to be right on this matter and who won't really become any happier by having Tomas insist on discussing it critically and sharing his experiences that come from a very un-American social environment. I can understand the decision to keep with it, though, as it's really difficult to let go of a discussion where you've been called out like that.<br/><br/>So in summation, I'd say that even if Todd is exaggerating or he has an ulterior agenda, it seems superficially unfair to claim that no knee-jerk dogmatism was present in that thread. Clearly at least one person felt it necessary to answer another with ideological catchphrasing instead of engaging his thinking. Wouldn't it be fairer to say that a bunch of people who have invested a lot on this topic (and ethical philosophy in general - it seems to me that we're all people very concerned with right and wrong) got off on the wrong foot because it's really easy to assume in the Internet that others are on board with your own ideological background?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376603/#Comment_376603" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-05T13:20:55+00:00" title="May  5, 2012  1:20PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2012 1:26PM by JDCorley.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Clearly at least one person felt it necessary to answer another with ideological catchphrasing instead of engaging his thinking.</blockquote>\nWell, if you want to stop one line snarky replies, and require everyone to fully explain themselves every time they post,  I can always find some other place to be hilarious. I'll only post here when I have really elaborate and thoroughly explained jokes, or serious posts?<br/><br/>But I see nothing in that one-line dismissal as being silencing or, as Todd accuses, totalizing <i>everyone</i> that disagrees or approaches things differently into one "part of the problem" category, so my "0 people are doing it" contention stands.  Seems like a pretty normal opinion/response to me. Tomas can say "hm, yes, it is easy for me to say from my position, but it is still true" or "how dare you, it is not easy for me to say" or "i am not in such a position, your assumption is wrong" or, well, nothing at all.

I mean, we constantly encounter things in this world that are not entirely one or the other - shades of grey, it's entirely possible that you're both exaggerating for rhetorical effect. To me it seems that the interpretation closest to reality is that while there were many people making honest attempts at discourse in that thread, there was also enough signs of ideological dogmatism that Todd's making it explicit by starting a critique of the American social justice movement in there was not entirely baseless.

Social encounters can be read in so many ways, perhaps there is nothing like an intellectual monoculture operating here and people all just agree with each other because the subject matter is so self-evident that only a fool or an evil man would differ. Accidental parallel thinking instead of ideological lock-step, why not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376609/#Comment_376609" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-05T13:42:24+00:00" title="May  5, 2012  1:42PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't even see the parallel thinking, honestly.  Like, a few people in that thread agreed with each other in some ways, but not in others, and others agreed with each other in some ways, but not in others. (You can't really tell anything from one-line posts.)<br/><br/>Even if there is an "intellectual monoculture" that is wrong and stupid here, big deal, what does that even mean? I like White Wolf games and 99.99999 percent of the people posting here believe those games are somewhere between intentionally damaging and accidentally toxic.  Doesn't mean I'm silenced. It seems to me that broad consensus that has settled on a terribly wrong and stupid belief instead means I have a target-rich environment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

My personal attitude mirrors yours, and I wouldn't mind a bit more rough and tumble environment myself where people could just let free-thinkers like yourself be. The perennial discussion sort of has its starting point in how to make disagreement hurt less, though; the zen, it doesn't want to be harshed by vigorous disagreement. So that's why we have these long and meandering philosophical discussions about what are the accepted ways of being heterodox and whose fault it is that people are not courteous.<br/><br/>(And yes, I recognize that Jason has it easier disagreeing about Whitewolf games than a racist has in an anti-racist environment or an anti-racist has in a racist environment - whichever type of environment we can agree SG to represent - as not as many people care as passionately about Whitewolf games as care about revolutionary politics. The basic attitudes are pretty similar, though, and I imagine that if we had people caring about Whitewolf as passionately as we care about racism, then WW would soon be just as much of a forbidden subject.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376633/#Comment_376633" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-05T19:00:45+00:00" title="May  5, 2012  7:00PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, it's not the same thing at all - but it's not like a "monoculture" (even if you can convince me one exists, which you can't from that previous thread) is inherently silencing.

Doing it with respect for human beings and their culture is good too, but we do not have to place the list too high. Most designers are amateurs, and can not be expected to live up to professional standards. That is indeed true for a competition like Game Chef.<br/><br/>If they try their best, as Edwards says, I'm content. Having erred they will get comments, and maybe learn something from that. Learning by doing is the best way ;-)</blockquote>\nThe thread's ostensible topic was about considering cultural appropriation in Game Chef. It really seems like Tomas is saying "cultural appropriation isn't very important compared to writing about what you want to write about." If that's what he's saying (maybe it isn't), it's hard to know how to engage with that in a productive manner as so many posters are saying we're supposed to. I obviously don't agree with that, but there's not a lot of middle ground on which to work! And apparently anything I say about how I disagree with that perspective will get me labeled as snide, judgemental and silencing. So how do I use that post to move the conversation forward?<br/><br/>My actual response, obviously, was just to engage with it as little as possible. But it's difficult in these threads, and I assure you, there are a lot of people, who are affected by these issues in real life, who find these conversations exhausting, and posts saying things like it seems Tomas is saying to be hurtful. Why is the onus on us to listen charitably and avoid giving offense, and not on the people we're talking to?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376886/#Comment_376886" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-07T02:57:23+00:00" title="May  7, 2012  2:57AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I understand, Liam. Tomas can be an ass in terms of tone, he sounds so self-satisfied. Substantially, though, he was being sincere, he explained a viewpoint I myself even agree with, and he didn't assault anybody else's viewpoints. Tomas occasionally draws rhetorical fire here simply because he sounds so smug when explaining how he understands things. I get the same thing now and then myself, and much for the same reasons.<br/><br/>Were I to substantially disagree with Tomas's initial post in that thread, I would take my lead from Thomas (Meserach) <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=375021" rel="nofollow">in the very next post</a>. He just... disagreed, even respectfully. That, and several follow-up posts, were entirely civilized as far as I see. It took some time for the thread to develop more extreme, as moderate posters said their piece and left, while those who felt strongly on the topic continued posting and replying to each other.<br/><br/>Considering the substance of the argument, I think Tomas's post there is a good example of the discussion technique problems we're having. From my viewpoint Tomas opens with an emblematic strong claim: he's been reading a thread where people talk in length about the importance of avoiding cultural appropriation, and he then starts his own contribution by putting the issue into context. He discusses how cultural appropriation fits in into his own artistic framework as an important consideration that is not, however, the guiding light of his work. I think that a cool head willing to discuss the substance of the issue (as opposed to just reinforcing group-think, which is basically what I'm seeing in some of the social justice contributions) would engage this observation instead of just berating him for not attributing unconditional importance to this thing.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pigeon</cite>Why is the onus on us to listen charitably and avoid giving offense, and not on the people we're talking to?</blockquote>\nI don't know... I wouldn't ask for either charitable listening or avoiding offense myself. This might be just a difference in phrasing the same things, but as far as I'm concerned charitable reading is just a discussion strategy (that is, if you can keep the interaction constructive without assuming the best from others, go ahead), and avoiding offense is not nearly as important as being polite enough to engage a discourse and avoiding low rhetorical blows. I know that many disagree with me on the nuances, but I'm leery of "avoiding offense" as a rule because it's practically always used as an argument for why somebody shouldn't hold the opinions they do.<br/><br/>But regarding the actual question, I totally think that the same standards of discussion should hold for everybody. This is one reason for why I don't deem somebody else's offense a central issue - if we're to avoid offending anybody at all, then everybody has a right to close down any discussion we might have. But yes, if we decide that offensive opinions are a discussion foul because they are offensive to anybody (as opposed to offensive to say moderators - I still think it entirely viable for the moderation to just silence the racists or whoever to regain peace), then that goes for everybody: a social justice ally shouldn't harass a racist with uncomfortable ideas about their privilege, and a racist shouldn't demand substantial debate over dearly-held convictions on the other side, either. In practice this means that any topic that is dear to somebody shouldn't be discussed at all, or should only be discussed in private among people who agree and don't offend each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376887/#Comment_376887" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-07T03:05:13+00:00" title="May  7, 2012  3:05AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2012 3:05AM by Dave Hallett.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Edit: cross-posted with Eero<br/><br/>The first thing I notice about Tomas's post is that "we do not have to place the list too high" doesn't actually make sense. Does he mean the "bar"? He's not a native English speaker, so I would be asking for clarification before simply telling him that he's wrong. Tomas sometimes has very strong opinions about things, but I've never seen him fail to respond to a polite question.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pigeon</cite>It really seems like Tomas is saying "cultural appropriation isn't very important compared to writing about what you want to write about."

I think given the vulnerability of Native American cultural heritage to being swamped by mainstream depictions of it, it wasn't a good choice for a Game Chef where people will by definition have to put something together in a hurry. I agree with Tomas that all we can really ask of people is that they make an honest effort and are open to feedback. I also agree with Elizabeth that we can judge their *games* by professional standards and call out lazy stereotyping or cultural misrepresentation where we see it, and expect them to respond. In other words, I think there is an awful lot of common ground that's being lost when people "stand up for what they believe in" without investigating whether the person they're talking to really holds the beliefs they think they do. This isn't the first thread it's happened on, either. It's a standard SG pattern on anything contentious, and it's a crying shame, IMO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376889/#Comment_376889" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-07T04:25:51+00:00" title="May  7, 2012  4:25AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2012 4:29AM by Graham.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What matters, to me, is that no one voice dominates discussion.

Throwing the Internet police on somebody who's only crime is that they're more invested in and better at debate seems backwards.<br/><br/>An experimental forum might see interesting results if each and every discussion thread involved voting for a thread chairman, with the thread starter as default. It wouldn't need to be a big deal, and ordinarily you wouldn't need to care about it, but where pertinent you could easily see which of the participants is currently responsible for maintaining order. Maybe some sort of karma-count system, if you believe in those. One can already see the germs of this type of behavior e.g. here at Story Games where people starting new threads attempt to control discussion on the strength of the argument that they started the thread so they get to decide.<br/><br/>Another possible solution would be to simply limit everybody to posting only once every however many hours. This would work if you're mostly concerned by the superficial issue of who posts the most.<br/><br/>I guess I find value-neutral solutions more palatable than increased moderation involvement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16454/zen-and-the-art-of-forum-moderation" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16454/zen-and-the-art-of-forum-moderation" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16454/zen-and-the-art-of-forum-moderation/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F16454%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F16454%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
