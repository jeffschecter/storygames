But, I also can not help to think how similar some of their mechanics are to RP games. <br/><br/>So my first question. Has anyone turned one of these game into a role playing game before?<br/><br/>Secondly, does anyone else think it would be interesting to turn these games into a Role Paying Game?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240368/#Comment_240368" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-03T21:16:58+00:00" title="November  3, 2009  9:16PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you looked at <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/games/unstore/game/28" rel="nofollow">Murderland</a>?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_240389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240389/#Comment_240389" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-04T05:15:56+00:00" title="November  4, 2009  5:15AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Monopoly, Risk, and Clue... VERY different games.<br/><br/>So Monopoly would be a game about developing real estate and driving your fellow players bankrupt. Very competitive. That would seem at odds with cooperative role playing.<br/><br/>Risk - a wargame of geo politics. You'd be role playing empires. That would be different. But Risk itself is a boring game.<br/><br/>Clue - murder mystery - clearly has the most potential as a role play game. I do Engle Matrix Game murder mysteries (as board games but EMGs are very role play like). There are other murder mystery games out there.<br/><br/>Of course you can't do a direct take on any of the games because of copyright and trademarks. All are very much alive games made by companies with legal departments. The trouble one would go to to make such a game would be more than I'd want to do if I couldn't sell it. So.... I think I'll pass on the project.<br/><br/>Now doing economic games, military political games, and murder mystery games sound cool. They can be done sooooo much better than the old classics.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240394/#Comment_240394" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-04T06:57:37+00:00" title="November  4, 2009  6:57AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lots of indie games emulate chess with the stake setting.

Twister has... often been used for "role playing" games. *ahem* <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Seems to me that the way to use a classic board game is either as a resource allocation system for a game in which spending resources provides efficacy or grants narration rights, or use a simple, fast game as a conflict resolution mechanic, with the "character elements" (stats, abilities, whatever) providing capabilities in that game. Didn't someone here once have an idea for an RPG hook into Mastermind (maybe for an investigation mechanic)?<br/><br/>LOTS of potential, here. To answer the OP: yes, it's interesting.
