A character starts with 5 points for Features, each line costs 1 point by default.  Features can be compelled and the player gets a FATE point of Conviction when the GM Compels them.  NPCs and Zones are also made of Features, and players can compel those Features with FATE points. <br/><br/>Conflict resolution starts with a 2d6 initiative roll, highest player first, then goes clockwise (GM wins if no one rolls better than a 7).  On your turn you can take 1 action or move (change Zones).  Actions are resolved with:<br/><br/><b>2d6 +-PC Features +Zone Features +General Circumstance Modifiers</b> <br/>vs <b>7 +-NPC Features +Zone Features +General Circumstance Modifiers</b>.  <br/><br/>Ties go to the player.  Default stakes for an action are tagging a 1 point Feature on something.  When you're not the one acting, you lose, and your Features already have given you penalty of -2, you're knocked out of the conflict and can't oppose your opponent in the same scene anymore.  You can spend 2 FATE points to roll an extra d6 before the roll, or to re-roll a die after the roll, or 3 FATE points to take an extra action or move on your turn.<br/><br/>Now the question: If all Features were worth 1 point and uniformly important, do you think this game is playable?  Have I screwed anything up in the design?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128887/#Comment_128887" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T19:58:49+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  7:58PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan,<br/><br/>I don't get how you lose conflicts.

Helps standardize turning them from a positive to a negative.  I might even suggest that you could track things by turning values negative, then flipping the card.  When it's positive, it grants a bonus as you list. When it's negative, it still grants a bonus, but it's easy to compell.  When it's face down, it's out of contention.  One point of damage degrades a card by one step (upright to inverted, inverted to flipped).*  You can probably also degrade your own traits voluntarily to trigger effects.**<br/><br/>So let's say we have a card that looks like this: <img alt="image" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3203/2283209924_581c9138ec.jpg?v=0"/><br/><br/>So long as it's upright, I get the flat bonus, all is well.  When it's inverted, it can be used against me, though I still get the underlying bonus.<br/><br/>Now, if you're using fate point, then this is pretty easy to handle. Inverted cards can be tagged, everything per usual. But since we're talking collectable, I'm imagining a form factor akin to <a href="http://www.key20.com/product.php?productid=305" rel="nofollow">Lair of the Rat King</a> - A single card box that's tall enough to hold 4d6 on top of it.  That doesn't leave room for chips, so that raises the question of how to do without Fate points, and I think the answer lies in tapping.<br/><br/>I can tap (turn from upright to inverted) any one of my cards to gain a bonus (say, a flat +2 or an extra die, whatever).  Alternately, I can untap (turn from inverted to upright- but not unflip) one of my opponents cards for a similar bonus.  If I really want, i can do both on a single roll, as can my opponent, - winner downgrades one of the opponents cards.<br/><br/>If "terrain" or scenario cards are introduced, they're placed between us, so the sides of th ecard face each participant.  Any player can take advantage of the terrain by turning so the inverted value is towards himself - This grants a small bonus (say +1) but now has one side favoring his opponent (the upright side).  The opponent can return it to a neutral position for a regular (+2 or a d6, whichever you go with) bonus,<br/><br/>This is all a bit off the cuff - There's a danger that two defensive players can stretch a conflict out pretty far, so I'd be tempted to do something to make the die roll have the possibility of extra success (say, 'spin' - do 2 downgrades if you beat the other guy by 5) but that may or may not have the desired effect. Easy enough to prototype out with a few index cards though.<br/><br/>-Rob D.<br/><br/>* - When a card is downgraded, the character receiving the downgrade always chooses which card or cards to downgrade.  One optional rule might allow them to downgrade any card, not just ones which are contributing to the fight (that might be a good PC only rule) and possibly steal the PDQ idea that the first thing you downgrade is your next plot hook.<br/><br/>** - Self-downgrading for effect is, of course, the way to introduce special cards into the game, if you're so inclined.  The Mystical Healer feature might say "flip this card, and restore and two other cards to upright position"*** or something else suitably mechanical.  I don't think this is strictly necessary, but this is very much where the collectibility comes in.<br/><br/>*** - If you do this, you almost certainly want a keyword system with at least a few categories (Physical, social, mental, magical etc.) so that you can have abilities keyed to keywords.<br/><br/><br/>PS - (All of which is to say, I think you've got a good foundation there).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128893/#Comment_128893" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T20:10:00+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  8:10PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul - You can set stakes around any action, and you lose those stakes if you lose that roll. <br/><br/>However, the default stakes (i.e. the ones that apply if no one feels like negotiating) are "Tag the other guy with a feature."  <br/><br/>If you lose those default stakes long enough you'll get to a point where you're at your opponent's mercy (because your Features will add to -1 and you'll lose the stakes).<br/><br/>Does that make sense?

If it's just a ruleset which lets people do their own cards, the special effects are best segmented off as a subsystem.  If it's a game kit, with a central deck to work with, the question switches over to how it's intended to be used (for example, is it a game, or is it a genre or setting specific kit).  If it's a truly open ended collectable model, then you totally want to turn the weirdness and one-offness to 11. <br/><br/>Similarly, how equitable is this game, and should that inequity be revealed in the cards, or in some other structure - for example, should there be more powerful cards for the GM to represent his power, or should the GM just have more cards, and more time to plan them, or should there be a GM at all?  If you decide that cards are not all mechanically equivalent, you need to think about how they get distributed.<br/><br/>Now, any answer to these questions work, but they suggest such divergent paths of design that they're really useful to nail down.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128984/#Comment_128984" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T06:11:56+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  6:11AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I had thought of the cards asl ooking kind of like a magic card - the bottom box being the "design playground" for the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129007/#Comment_129007" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T07:27:21+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  7:27AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, then we definitely want a certain amount of uneven distribution of potency among the cards, but we also need some check against the Chess: The Gathering strategy, which is to say just taking the most potent cards.  There are a couple of possibilities for this.<br/><br/>The first might be randomness.  If we're talking just pick up and play, where I deal you 5 cards and thats your character, then a certain amount of potential imbalance might actually be fun, provided play moves quickly.<br/><br/>The second is price.  Buy cards with a point buy is probably the most direct way to do it - a character may be 5-10 "points" worth of cards, with cards beign worth 1-3 (or more) points based on special effects.<br/><br/>The third might be an inverse value.  If there's some second attribute which is higher on weaker cards.  One possibility, if you want to use fate points,  would be to take a page from the Dresden game, and tie it to "refresh".  In this case, every card has a value in fate points, which is higher for weaker cards. The total of the fate point values is how many you start with (and possibly your max pool), so the guy with the less potent cards has more opportunities to make them awesome.  Be a little tricky to balance, but I think it's doable.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129024/#Comment_129024" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T08:05:26+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  8:05AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think options 2 and 3 can be worked in some combination, but I like 2 best (balance by price).
