Nordic larps use workshops before a game. Sometimes, they take as long as the games themselves -- several hours or more -- but in Nordica, many players view them as an integral part of the game experience, and one that vastly improves the quality of play. Generally, workshops consist of a series of exercises that fulfill one or more of the following functions:<br/><br/>- Ice breakers, getting people to laugh with each other, and developing out-of-game relationships<br/>- teaching the techniques of the game. This can include stuff like "cut and brake," physical mechanics, such as boffer fighting, etc.<br/>- communicating the vision for the game and the style of play (is this a comedy or tragedy? a competition or playing to lose? should players avoid leaving this room because it will break the game?)<br/>- developing characters either partially (in the case of pre-written characters)<br/>- helping players embody characters through acting exercises<br/>- developing relationships between characters so that people have stuff to play on.<br/>- auxiliary exercises like guided meditations or conversations to develop the themes of the game.<br/><br/>Read more here on the Nordic Larp Wiki -- <a href="http://nordiclarp.org/wiki/Pre-larp_Workshop" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://nordiclarp.org/wiki/Pre-larp_Workshop</a><br/><br/><br/>Workshopping seems slow to catch on here in the states. I'm wondering why. Also:<br/><br/>What's important to include? How do people approach running them before larps? Has anyone used them before tabletop games?

Play is expected to follow established mechanisms and span multiple events.  Your first time you are a new player and there is orientation, after that you are considered to "know how to play" and "don't need further teaching."  Players are usually a mix of new, intermediate, and veteran players.  Play is also selfishly focused on the player-character relationship which is your sacred thing rather than character-character relationships, which would need to be established and practiced.  From this prospective, beginning an instance of play with a workshop for everyone may seem unnecessary and may contribute to their not taking off among "traditional" American LARPers.

They don't call them workshops, and they don't force every single player to participate in them, but they have been using the concept of having a get-together to prepare for the game for a long long time. In that respect, it's not slow to catch on at all - I'd say more new live combat games use pre-event-events than don't, as far as I've seen in my local scene and the impression I get of how things go in other scenes.<br/><br/>It is true, though, that one-shot larps in the US usually don't have workshop-like pre-events. But, really, one-shot larps in the US have rarely been much of a thing outside a small sprinkling of things here and there and 2 consistent groups (more than 5 years of more than 3-4 games per year) that I know of - the Intercon group on the east coast and the UCLA Enigma group on the west coast. And most of the one-shots played have tended toward the whimsical rather than the serious, so the extra time commitment of workshops and formal post-game discussions were seen as an unnecessary barrier to entry.<br/><br/>It's really hard to get new people into the hobby in the US (though the stigma is fading as more positive media representations appear). So asking people to commit to extra time to do pre-game work before they've had a chance to experience the fun parts of larping is generally seen as something too many new folks won't be willing to risk up front. (Which is ironic, because doing good workshopping greatly reduces the risk of having a negative experience during the game. But it is what it is.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troels%20Ken" title="Troels Ken"><img alt="Troels Ken" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troels%20Ken">Troels Ken</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417335/#Comment_417335" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-27T12:13:04+00:00" title="June 27, 2013 12:13PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have come to believe that one of the keys to succesful tabletop workshopping is to start producing juicy, game-relevant fiction as early on as possible. When I make workshops of some length for a tabletop or chamber larp, I split into a warm-up phase and a prologue phase, with as much prologue as is practical, where players will be either in character or describing and telling game-relevant and game-true stuff, leaving as little time "wasted" as possible.<br/><br/>Pros and cons? Con, there's the issue of time consumption and time constraints, and lengthy non-fiction-producing workshops can get when-do-we-get-to-the-game boring. With a little care to keep workshops fiction-relevant and not boring, I have trouble seeing other cons than time constraints. Pros: Too many to list. I particularly like evidence based casting, if I have to name a favourite.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417342/#Comment_417342" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-27T13:33:27+00:00" title="June 27, 2013  1:33PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>We (tabletop nerds) prioritize play so intensely that this is hard to process.</blockquote>\nFalse. Think of activities like: reading rulebooks (very important to trpg culture), creating characters (or drawing dungeons, &amp; other forms of "lonely fun"), pitching a campaign (and other sorts of brainstorm/briefing).<br/>We children of the Forge, specifically, have a strong tendency to point out how all of these things are actually an integral part of "play", and design consequently (less true for the "reading rulebooks" part, but something's finally happening in that area as well). But one could just as easily reverse this statement and call the "setup" segment of a Fiasco game a "workshop", you know: because what we do during setup is different from what we do during that which is somehow identifiable as the "main" part of a game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lizziestark" title="lizziestark"><img alt="lizziestark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lizziestark">lizziestark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417344/#Comment_417344" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-27T14:00:59+00:00" title="June 27, 2013  2:00PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But here's the thing: workshopping is also part of the "good part" of the game. It builds anticipation, settles anxiety, introduces you to people, and settles unrest.<br/><br/>I've found that it is good for luring first-time larpers in. You can say stuff like, "I know you're nervous about playing a character, but don't worry about it -- we'll teach you how to do it in the workshop." Or, "come try the workshop, and if you decide it's not your thing, you can leave before the game starts, without feeling awkward about it."<br/><br/>I think that stuff like character creation in indie games can have some stuff that's similar to workshopping. Things like fighter practice have some similarities too, though I think that the purpose of workshopping is defeated when not everyone participates.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of Troels' evidence-based casting thing too, where you basically peg people as introverts or extroverts and assign roles accordingly. Lots of interesting theory in there, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417347/#Comment_417347" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-27T14:15:28+00:00" title="June 27, 2013  2:15PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ain't nobody got time for that.<br/>Workshops before a game that might take hours?  <br/>People don't wanna even stop and talk about tender subjects, let alone prepare for pretend.<br/>How'd you guys get a ahead of us, culture-wise?  <br/>Didn't role playing games kinda originate here?<br/>Who or what can I blame?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troels%20Ken" title="Troels Ken"><img alt="Troels Ken" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troels%20Ken">Troels Ken</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417349/#Comment_417349" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-27T14:25:27+00:00" title="June 27, 2013  2:25PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, workshopping can be good!

If you need someone to be a source of shenanigans, to push the other players, you need an instigator. Planners often do well in more reactive roles.<br/><br/>Kind of a pattern here, casting-wise, heh.

The former has built a philosophy with methods around improvisation and the latter have tons of exercises to free the participants' minds and get them  more focused.<br/><br/>For me, I would like to see games that have a setup like <b>Fiasco </b>but with exercises. They can all be part of the game, either by introducing the game, creating relations, or by creating a situation that everything then takes a leap from during the "real" session. All this while freeing everybody's mind and make them work together. I'm not even saying that this have to be like a workshop. It can take between 10-60 minutes, depending on how long you want to play the game.<br/><br/>So I totally agree with <b>Troels</b>.

I don't have a lot to add, but I'd like to hear more about this.<br/><br/>We've been doing a number of Nordic LARPS and Jeepform games pretty regularly in Portland for a while now. We haven't been doing the workshop bit as completely as these games suggest is normal. I mean, yeah, we do the character/scenario set up and meet 'n greet stuff, but we don't usually go too deep into the techniques. As far as I can tell, this has not hurt or experiences with these games.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why that is, and it could be that we are missing out on something. But, most of us doing this are regular story gamers, and I wonder if there is a point of commonality between a story gamer style and a Nordic freeform style. In particular I'm referring to the Immersion vs. Play to Show agendas (if you want to call them that). For that reason, I doubt that the practices of traditional American LARP activities are to the same purpose as the pre-game workshop of Nordic freeform theater games. In fact, it seems to me that the pre-game workshop may be a a tool prevent the inclusion of traditional LARP practices that are at-odds with the freeform experience.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm really interested in where this conversation goes!<br/><br/>Tayler                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417363/#Comment_417363" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-27T17:01:39+00:00" title="June 27, 2013  5:01PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For a while, following things like initiation scenes in Dogs in the Vineyard, there was a bit of pre-play that happened in some tabletop games.

I don't know all that many exercises, but here are a few I'm thinking of:<br/><br/> So like, doing the hot-seat exercise, where one person is "on" and the others zap them with questions ranging from "what is your favorite color?" to "what is your biggest regret?" with the understanding that these answers don't need to be set in stone.<br/><br/>And then a little talking about relationships, how people view the group, and so on. This is stuff that naturally happens already during many character-creation phases. But giving it a little time and having the GM prompt with some questions (or maybe playing out a scene where people first met?) could add extra depth, I'd imagine. I often have a hard time a) remembering people's character names, b) remembering my relationships with them well enough to play on that during a game. A few reinforcing exercises helps me a lot. It'd also be possible to use that time talking about the themes we're about to play on and for the GM and players to get a sense of how the group wants to play the game (for comedy, for tragedy, close to home, etc.).<br/><br/>I'd imagine that with four players, you could probably do the two above things in about half an hour. When you add more players, it seems like the required time increases, in part because there are more potential relationships to explore. So with big larps I've also seen stuff like status lines and so on. I really like exercises like that because it divorces the status of my character from me and in doing so, makes it easier to play on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417580/#Comment_417580" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-30T18:20:47+00:00" title="June 30, 2013  6:20PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 1, 2013 10:28AM by Rickard.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here are two relationship-building exercises.<br/><br/>1.

Examples: a) "You left me for dead" b) "It was you and me that summer." c) "I was the one who helped you during your divorce."<br/><br/>The person who catches the ball then answers back by twisting what have already been said. Say the first thing that comes into mind. Examples: a) "It was either you or the town. I needed that bag!" b) "But you were never my friend." c) "It was just sex! Get over it!"<br/><br/>After a while, there will be a web of relations that hopefully entangles the group.<br/><br/>2. The GM gives out a theme for the group - a high school gang, dragon slayers, or breakers. The GM then asks questions about status. "Who is the leader?" - "Who is the real leader?" - "Who is the soldier?" - "Who is the caring one?" and so on. Continue to build relations by putting each character in a scene with another. Give out where it is and what has happened. "The soldier and the leader: you're at the scrap yard when a new gang arrives." - "The real leader and the caring one: you're at a playground and drinking while planning what to do that evening."<br/><br/>Related: <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18362/needed-warm-up-excersiseice-breaker/p1" rel="nofollow">a thread of ice-breakers exercises</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417590/#Comment_417590" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-01T00:40:59+00:00" title="July  1, 2013 12:40AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 1, 2013 5:43AM by w176.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part of this have to do with time privileges.

The larp convention Prolog for example is full of workshops on everything from status play, Ars Armandi, game design, roleplaying injuries, gear making, body language, mass hysteria, flirting, how to make digital solutions for games, ho to crossplay, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417594/#Comment_417594" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-01T05:34:02+00:00" title="July  1, 2013  5:34AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 1, 2013 5:34AM by zircher.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "ho to crossplay", totally accidental, but still funny.

So a lot of Forgeista designs emphasize being low-to-no prep. That's where I think the disconnect comes from between Jason (Morningstar) and Rafu: the importance/necessity of pre-play is a major point of contention in the American tabletop scene, along with the role of the GM (if there is one), how closely to adhere to rules, etc.<br/><br/>On Saturday at Recess I ran <a href="http://www.flatlandgames.com/btw/" rel="nofollow">Beyond the Wall</a>. The setup phase took a good 45-55 minutes, but it was all worth it (and that stuff is definitely the best part of the system)\u2014of course it also helped that I only had 3 players. But both the character relationships (PC and NPC) and the town map felt rich and well-developed going in compared to other similar games I've played.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417600/#Comment_417600" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-01T09:51:10+00:00" title="July  1, 2013  9:51AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>There's much to learn from improv here.<br/><br/>I was told there are two sorts of warm-up: energetic ones, that get you energised, and meditative ones, that get you focussed.

Depending on the game, and it can also depending on where you are in the process. <br/><br/>If you have half a day of workshops before a larp for example you might do energizing warm-ups to get the energy level up staring a new activity etc. I think for tabletop both types of warm-ups are on the table, depending on the game, etc.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417809/#Comment_417809" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-05T10:40:17+00:00" title="July  5, 2013 10:40AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Worth mentioning is that workshops also happens at conventions without any particular game in mind.
