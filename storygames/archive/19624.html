I certainly hate it, it made me leave their games. But then again, I have to admit it's my opinion, other players and GMs may have their own, and since there are people still playing with them I'm trying to figure what it is that they are doing right. If I get to pinpoint it, it will definitely go to the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18646/techniques-do-we-have-a-list-of-them#Item_1" rel="nofollow">Techniques thread</a>, but I need to extirpate anything that can turn the technique into dysfunctional play. I gotta beg your pardon if I sound highly opinionated against their GMing style, I've got my reasons. But at the same time I'd really like you to convince me there's something to be saved here. I do feel that there's something worthy, but I can't pinpoint it yet.<br/><br/><b>What do they do?</b> -allow me to rant a bit- They GM trad games as Vampire and 3.5 D&amp;D in exactly the same way: players are "adventurers" in a place unknown to them, they get to be railroaded into a quest willing, under a threat or fall into it because they don't have anything else to do or go to. They do a lot of prep in advance, in the best case the prep is so much that it's the equivalent of a complex net of railroads, but never gets to be a sandbox. Whenever the GM frames scenes, they of course don't tell everything to the players, let slip here and there some small misunderstandings if that will help them railroad them further; and otherwise tries to trick them into doing something by instilling more doubt in them. When the players roll the dice and fumble, their character gets humilliated at best and impaired or killed at worst. They do try to use the fiction to save the players if this came to happen by bad luck, but not when it's by the player's choices, even if these choices were taken because of their misdirections.<br/><br/>I have tried to talk them both out of this GMing style, didn't had too much success (so you know, it's not a communication problem), then tried to talk to them about why they do it but they can't explain it too well. They sustain that they do this for the players, that doing otherwise would be to make the game too easy for them. Since I can't get too much more from them, now I'm in the territory of inferences.<br/><br/><b>My best guess is</b> that they are running a game in two levels. One is in the fiction, in which they tell a story for the players to experience in first person (both like to frame great scenes and impressive or really strange characters) though they need/love to have a certain degree of control about what the player's will experience and how they will react, since the right reaction will trigger another scene or twist that they hav prepared in advance. When that reaction doesn't come, or makes them think the game will derrail in the future, true dysfunctional GMing starts in the shape of NPCs that bend and breake rules "because they can, even when you don't know why... yet!", menaces that pop out of nowhere and miracles preserving the statu quo everywhere. And those are their best excuses anyway.<br/><br/>The other level of the game they are running is a meta-intrigue. They misinform, misdirect and try to trick the players into following the plot in a certain way or another depending on what scene or future twist they have in mind. They can't lie, unless a good dice roll allows them to do it. PCs have to believe, unless a good dice roll allows them to doubt. If anyone plays inthe their hands, the GMs have the right to mock, power down or kill their character.<br/><br/>Player's can't meta-game, it's against the social contract and strongly enforced by the group (except when the group is already frustrated with the GM). But suddenly in a couple of sessions all of them are plotting against the GM. They start to min-max, powergame, look for loopholes in the rules, push small timebombs into the fiction that go under the GMs radar to blow their railroads a few scenes later, look for the slightest excuse to kill NPCs or destroy any other device the GM could possibly use to railroad them... and they all have fun with this. Even the GM.<br/><br/>Ok, maybe I'm looking at this in a too negative way. There are probably a lot more good things in this kind of gameplay than I'm not seeing. If you had a similar or better experience with trad games that go along these lines, please add anything that could help me see this GMing and playing style in a new light.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435883/#Comment_435883" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-28T12:25:33+00:00" title="July 28, 2014 12:25PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like pretty classic stuff. It can be a hard habit to break for many people because it's gotten ingrained. I have a friend who used to do this a lot (even calling for scene do-overs if things went against the plan). I talked about it with him but nothing changed... <br/><br/>...until I took over GMing and showed him how much less work and stress it was to not preplan so much. Like, I pitched and ran some AW, DW, InSpectres, et cetera (and some games like Durance or Fiasco with no prep or GM). After he witnessed a lot of awesome games and saw how little prep I did to get us there, he was eager to figure out the style.<br/><br/>Do you guys rotate GMs?

Lots of people like it. Lots of people think it's the only way to play, really. It puts all responsibility for Fun in the GM's hands. The players are there for a show, and a good GM is a rock star. The GM manipulates the table subtly like a master magician, and the result is spectacular. Everyone is impressed by the adroit storytelling. Player choices matter less than they might believe, because the GM is going to push things the way he wants regardless of what choice a player makes. The GM probably fudges dice and changes stuff on the fly to make his story happen, and mostly the players feel that's fine, because that's what GMs do, because of Rule Zero, and because it makes for a better story. <br/><br/>Personally, I hate this style of play and even find some forms of it ethically problematic, but to each his own. I used to run lots of games this way, so it's not like I don't know what I'm talking about. I've talked at length about this elsewhere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435893/#Comment_435893" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-28T14:11:57+00:00" title="July 28, 2014  2:11PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Adam, in every particular.<br/><br/>I'll add one thing:<br/><br/>I often hear people say that this is the way they love to play, and why should it change if it isn't broken? It's tempting to say, "Hey, ok, sure, if you say so." The thing that keeps me coming back, though, is this part you're describing:\n<blockquote>[...] when the group is already frustrated with the GM [...] But suddenly in a couple of sessions all of them are plotting against the GM. They start to min-max, powergame, look for loopholes in the rules, push small timebombs into the fiction that go under the GMs radar to blow their railroads a few scenes later, look for the slightest excuse to kill NPCs or destroy any other device the GM could possibly use to railroad them... and they all have fun with this. Even the GM.[...]</blockquote>\nI suppose I could say: point this out to them, show them this behaviour, and ask if it's the way that they want to play. Is this their idea of an ideal game? Do they really enjoy this behaviour, or do they engage in it because they don't know what to do instead?<br/><br/>Now, if you accept this playstyle as something you can't or won't or don't want to change:<br/><br/>For participating in such a game as a player, I think the key is to "get onboard the train" as much as possible. Figure out what the game's about and playing along as much as possible. Is the GM hoping that you'll be naive, idealistic heroes who get screwed over because of their own scruples? Then make that kind of character and play it to the hilt.<br/><br/>* Think of yourself as an NPC, rather than a PC. Make it a challenge to portray your character as memorably as possible, engage with game-world details (culture, weaponry, magic, tradition, whatever), put on an accent, make your character a foil to the other characters and give them what they need (the funny guy needs a "straight man", the sad loner needs someone who is fascinated by their stories of lost glory, etc, etc.).<br/><br/>* Talk to the GM; offer to help them with the railroad, and design your character accordingly.<br/><br/>* Recognize moments when you DO have full freedom (perhaps in trouble-shooting a problem the GM has set out and expects you to overcome, in preparing your character background, falling in love with a NPC who is likely going to betray you, etc), and save your gamer energy for those moments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435899/#Comment_435899" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-28T14:47:24+00:00" title="July 28, 2014  2:47PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a matter of style, and believing that any artist's style is "wrong" is a fascistic way of thinking.

At some point on my post, I must have made a terribly mistake. Perhaps more than one. I admit that my first mistake was to complain and rant about it. Just to clear out some facts that I should have really mentioned from the start:<br/><br/>-I no longer play with those GMs, they are good fellows, they still GM for other guys that like their style but I recognized long ago that wasn't my style and jumped right through the window with a smile.<br/>-Yes we talked with them alone, in groups, in different ocassions, made interventions and finally give up. They are like that, their games are like that and the people that still play with them no longer complains, so it's all good.<br/>-I'll never go back to play with them, don't intend to try again, nor I really want to try to make them change their GMing style.<br/><br/><b>What I want is to analyze this GMing style, chop out all the things that make it dysfunctional for people like me and see if there's something I can rescue out of it, even if I get to use it or not.</b><br/><br/>Now, my problem is that I'm out of further data. I can still talk with these GMs, but so far I haven't been able to figure out what they really really like from the game. At some point it looks like they won't say it because they will have to admit that they need to extert authority over the group in order to make their illusionism work, that they are eager to try anything to make it work and if that includes cheating the players out of their freedom of choice or the right to play with the fiction, then so be it.<br/><br/>I'm not even angry at this and I'd totally agree to it if these GMs were honest and tell me straight what they want before the game starts. But it seems that this way of roleplaying is so ingrained into their minds that they feel the urge to start cheating the players from the moment they ask him / he offers to GM. Most probably in their minds, it's not cheating at all, it's <i>playing</i>.<br/><br/>I too have GMed a ton of campaigns with illusionism, I know it's usual and have read thousands of posts, rants, opinions and advice about this GMing style.

The player becomes the character.<br/><br/>JRPGs usually provide a better story, but WRPGs gives more freedom to what you want to do. I don't hold anything better than anything else. If I wouldn't like JRPGs, then I wont stand and shout at people that they shouldn't play it (except when it's about extrinsic rewards ... but that's another topic). I could probably show WRPGs, but I wouldn't get offended or hurt if they didn't like it. Perhaps they will, possibly because it haven't existed in their world before, but they could also be so used to JRPGs that they expect that that is the experience that they will get from WRPGs too. Expectations tend to make anything unsatisfactory if they aren't met.<br/><br/>But don't stand and shout about WRPGs to people, or how bad JRPGs are. I had enough of that from religious people. As little as I like being called "satanic", as little I would enjoy being called "dysfunctional", or "brain damaged". Using (negative) labels like that ... is lack of respect (as long as it's not about rewards as dog treats, but ... yeah. A different topic.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11" title="cupbearer11"><img alt="cupbearer11" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/394/n8RA473UODIN7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11">cupbearer11</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435910/#Comment_435910" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-28T16:13:57+00:00" title="July 28, 2014  4:13PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 28, 2014 4:27PM by cupbearer11.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>M<b></b>Y EVIL ADMISSION:</b><br/><br/>Actually, i am a DM who does a lot of those things listed, but only in our 16 year long 2nd edition d&amp;d campaign. In the last few years I've tended to agree with Warrior monk on alot of this. But I also agree with AsIf too.  I think maybe there is room for all of these types of GM styles.  And i do use both styles of play.  In our long game it is heavy railroad.  In the other games i run or am part of, I work as hard as i can to curb that kind of behaviour.  I don't use this heavy handed 'technique' when i play Dungeon world or AW or Tremulus or other indie style games, when i'm playing those games I decry this sort of behaviour. <br/> <br/>Whats funny about this is that the players actually like the 2nd edition game the best, i don't know if that says somethign about being railroaded or if it has to do with the nostalgia of playing for so long, but we play once a month and the people come and really want to see what will happen next.  I can barely convince them to play anything else.<br/><br/><b>How i do it:</b><br/>I agree that alot of it is ledgermain, stagecraft, and I am a good storyteller so it works for me (in that particular game); but a lot of it is also a desire to feel special and that the world has a kind of fate behind it where you are destined to do great things.  I consider the game to be successful and i do agree that this type of DM style is actually sub standard, but at the same time I do vary my approach so maybe my style isn't as heavy handed as your DM's is.  How i do this is to vary the approach to different parts of the story, encounter, episodes, so that its not always railroading that is occurring.  I do this by creating different types of challenges with different types of possible solution mechanisms.  I never tell them which one i am utilizing, so that they can never truly know what is in their hands and what isn't.  Its fraud, but if you like you can steal it and defraud some poor unfortunate story gamers too... here it is:<br/><br/><b>Event mix</b><br/>Railroad<br/>Railroad with Grand pivot<br/>Open ended ("proper way to play")<br/>Simulationist<br/>Collaborative.<br/><br/><b>Railroad</b><br/>In railroad parts, the outcome is more or less certain, the only thing that isn't rigged is the combats, but after two decades of playing the game i know what people can and can't beat, and if im unsure, i play out the battle at home before the game to simulate the situations to a 't', this is where i get to have those beautiful set peice situations that are typcially rare in open ended story games.  I am a decent writer (i'm a novelist by hobby too,) so this where i get to use those 'talents'.<br/>Example:  Young woman NPC is destined to turn out to be the kings daughter and win the crown.  If she dies in the first adventure we never see that happen, at level 9 the girl takes up her fathers sword in a climactic battle at the city gates, she holds it aloft.  People were excited, they loved this scene.  Railroaded completely.  The key to railroading is to know that secretly people like form and meaning, but not consciously.  When your monsters die, get mad or embarrassed or take on a wounded look... in the above moment of glory for the girl, she had to roll very high... do not fudge rolls (and never ask for do overs of scenes, i would walk out of a game like that), if she didn't roll high, weave that into the story (in my case I rolled 20 and max damage.... maybe there are other levels of railroading that i don't know of!)<br/><br/><b>Railroad with Grand pivot</b><br/>Basically a railroad, but a huge decision is inserted sort of like a choose your own adventure fork.  The outcome is usually humungous and will obviously show that the game is not railroaded (teehee)....<br/>Example:  A character had to choose between becoming king and following his religion.  Each one had massive consequences but the point of the excercise was to show that he had absolute control over the outcome. <br/><br/><b>Open ended</b><br/>In the open ended parts, i play it more or less how the you high end GMs do here on story games, more or less how AW supposes it should be done.  Typically speaking, just read AW and this would be how its done.  <br/>Example:  A character decides that a certain legal clause gives him control over an expedition.  This could seriously derail my story, but this was an open ended section, so i let him roll his CHA to see if he could woo the captain into believing his side of events.  He made the roll, became leader (against the parties wishes lol)...<br/><br/><b>Simulationist</b><br/>Simulationist parts are like open ended except there are real life factors that can't be controlled like weather and npc reactions, these are pre generated (and then I stick to them no matter how its going) or randomly rolled.<br/>Example:  A cargo ship carrying seige guns was known to have run aground on a sand bar, near where a battle had taken place.  A character decided to lead his men to capture it.  I designed the scenario so that everything ran on a time table, even the weather.  It was a flat enounter becuase he dilly dallied and the ship was rescued before he could even attempt the operation (the downside of simulation... but still interesting.)<br/><br/><b>Collaborative</b><br/>Collaborative parts are when i have no freaking clue how the heck they can do this, but I essentially make that whatever they decide to do will work no matter what.  <br/>Example: The party is stuck in a castle that is designed by the great trap maker.... They must navigate a passage that contains some instant death trap.  I had no idea how the trap work or how it would be disarmed.  I also didn't leave it to a roll.  I listened to the players decide on what the trap was and then agreed with them.  They disarmed it, and would have been able to no matter what.  In a sense then, i let them DM the world. The key here was that they didn't know it was collaborative, they thought they had outwitted me on the trap.<br/><br/><i>RINSE AND REPEAT.</i>  Muwahahaha....<br/><br/>Basically alternate between these, the railroads still remain as buoys in the midst of the story, but these other parts strengthen both the illusion and give some power over to the players.  I'm open that some parts are railroaded, i just never say which.  Its a bizarre thing, but people are having fun and i guess thats why people play these kinds of games.  (to have fun i mean, not be ermm railroaded).<br/><br/>I now open the gates for those who would bash me... lol.. maybe i deserve it.  But as i've said above, I play your style too and i like it alot, so don't try to convert me, I have one foot on both sides of the river....<br/><br/>Oliver.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435911/#Comment_435911" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-28T16:28:59+00:00" title="July 28, 2014  4:28PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, crossposting, sorry. Ok, <a href="/forums/profile/Aslf">@Aslf</a>, you're on the right way. Well, about the players, they are quite adaptable and once they find the GM ain't aiming at their throat, they tend to relax and enjoy creating a story together. Yet relaxing is a bit difficult process for some of them. In my case it took trying different games to get rid of the need of optimizing my character to protect it from the GM. When I finally agreed to try Pathfinder with a different GM I stressed again at creating a character, looking for all the options I could take that could protect it. I talked with the GM and worked over my stress, to finally kinda enjoy the game, though I still felt quite insecure when rolling the dice. Other players still tend to min-max as a reflex, but don't stress as I do. Others already consider that part of the fun of the game.<br/><br/>Uh, ok, I'm re-reading this and looks like that didn't help. Let me try something different.<br/><br/>Ok, definitely the meta-intrigue level is something. I wonder if players could be more open to this kind of fun once the group agrees that this will be part of the fun. Think of it, the GM sits at the table, openly stating that this game will be a duel of witts between him and the players. He can add that one amongst the players has agreed to help him, but of course he can't tell who. The challenge is that the group has to finish the campaign by completing the main quest in the fiction. If their characters are killed, they have to start back in level 1 and find a way to reunite with the group. They are limited to the core manual for character options. The GM can misdirect, and give poor info, or outright lie to the players on a good Bluff roll. The PCs will have to believe unless they make a good Sense Motive roll. Otherwise they can plot and try to derrail all they want, while the GM can try anything to take them back to the tracks.<br/><br/>I dunno, a couple adjustments aht that could certainly be a game to remember; it's like really taking trad games into a totally different level. It may not be not exactly a trad rpg anymore, but something closer to a larp in some strange way. At least that could be something I'd be willing to play with those GMs. I wonder if they would like it too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435912/#Comment_435912" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-28T16:31:52+00:00" title="July 28, 2014  4:31PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds pretty cool, WM.<br/><br/>A question: were my suggestions, above, helpful at all?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435913/#Comment_435913" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-28T16:48:30+00:00" title="July 28, 2014  4:48PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 28, 2014 5:08PM by AsIf.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I liked your in-joke, Paul!  And I love this thread again.  <a href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11">@cupbearer11</a> that was great.<br/><br/>As to the restated questions raised by <a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a>, I will say this to get a more theoretical ball rolling: In a sense, you're railroading all the time.  The difference is a matter of grainsize.  Every time a GM personally decides what the interpretation of a roll or the next event to occur is, they are creating a tiny little section of railroad and running the players down it.  <i>Boom, that's a thing that happened.</i>  Tiny little section of railroad.  The difference is that in classic illusionism these sections are larger than one scene, they often comprise whole acts or adventures, and tangential lines generally lead back toward the central one; while in some styles of play they are smaller than a whole scene, teeny-tiny, and when strung together in sequences they end up someplace nobody really expected (in theory).  Railroad sections can be exactly the size of one scene, as well.  That's like a Fiasco turn when you Resolve.  They can be any grainsize.<br/><br/>It's even possible to mix grainsizes together, although the level with the longest sections must maintain continuity precedence over the lower ones.  My 1991 HyperTheater piece "Ghosts in the Machine" is an example (although today we would call it a "Theatrical LARP").  From the aftershow press release: "The presentation included one "Primary" PlotLine, which could be resolved in only one of two ways. "Secondary" PlotLines were developed around supporting Co-Actor Characters and hourly themes, and each possessed a number of possible resolutions (many possessed no specified resolution at all). "Tertiary" PlotLines were comprised of clues and props given to Players, which drove them to seek out other Players or props, or to enact sequences which did not radically undermine the higher tiers. There were, of course, a number of red herrings thrown in for good measure. No indication was made to Players that these distinctions existed."<br/><br/>No matter where you decide to stand, even if it's just for a lark, or just for a little while, it takes some energy and artistic effort to produce a campaign.  Any kind of campaign.  Whether you prefer TV ensemble dramas, serial comic books or murder mystery theater pieces, they all require their artists.  Narrativist Gamers shouldn't think Simulationist Gamers are any more "wrong" than they themselves would wish to be considered.  Improvisers don't think actors who memorize lines are categorically lesser artists.  CYOA writers don't think linear novels are categorically a lesser artform.  They are just <i>different artforms,</i> they work on different levels, they have different degrees, angles and distributions of artistic intention, and they are all enjoyed by <i>someone.</i>  Surely no open-minded artist would willingly become prejudiced against another artist's work simply due to the fact that they work in different artforms.  Right?  Right.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435914/#Comment_435914" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-28T16:54:40+00:00" title="July 28, 2014  4:54PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 28, 2014 5:07PM by AsIf.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a> - When I worked for <i>The Palace</i> (one of the first 2d virtual world avatar chat systems), we did an informal survey of our users.

Players outwitting the GM is another kind of fun. The GM outwitting the players is fun just for the GM, which is why it must be kept as a private joke. Save the laughs for later, make them have fun. The only reason I no longer GM like that is because I got other responsabilities in real life that didn't let me prep enough. My illusionism went crappy and so my campaigns. <br/><br/>However in one of the later campaigns, while I railroaded a good start (PCs woke up in a bar and things went <i>a la</i> Hangover, except that they had actually lost 5 years from their memories and had lots of worrysome stuff on their travel chest, including a sign for a bounty on their heads for kidnapping a princess... and the head of such princess.) but then the game kinda went dead with the PCs running from here to there asking questions. Then, we all made made something we will never forget. They started joking about stop running and creating their own religion. I found the idea so interesting that I took their word, bring the current session to a halt (they were in the middle of a computer-generated dungeon, yeah, my prep had become <i>that</i> crappy) and helped them create their cult. For the next session my inspiration had turned on again and I was throwing everything I could at them while they started to take the city, train their followers, convert the authorities and lead their people into holy quests.<br/><br/>That certainly thaugth me a lot about collaborative play. Nowadays I can't even think of playing without it. After all, why built a complicate setting alone if you can do it with the players and save you the effort of trying to explain it all to them? It doesn't even destroy the excitement of exploration if they keep things general and you take their input to build more stuff over it. The whole process makes the players feel they already know stuff about their world like any ordinary denizen of it should.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11" title="cupbearer11"><img alt="cupbearer11" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/394/n8RA473UODIN7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11">cupbearer11</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435917/#Comment_435917" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-28T17:07:03+00:00" title="July 28, 2014  5:07PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/AsIf">@AsIf</a>  yeah i agree with that.

No, i totally agree.  I run two games right now, one is that old school never ending game i discussed, the other is DWorld, and it is the polar opposite, I've also run GURPS in a more collaborative open ended way as well.   I think i realized what i was doing was 'wrong' in university after reading the Mage's storyteller's handbook which basically said:  If you want to railroad, stop playing this game and go write a novel I took that suggestion to heart (wrote a novel--a lousy one... but thats for the Game of stories website not this one)...  Its hard to convince peopel though.<br/>A bunch of us were going to play a match up of A wicked age's rotating GM and oracle play with the mechanics from EVERWAY and the EVERWAY universe (spherewalker sourcebook), as i was explaining the mechanics of the tarot deck (you resolve actions by literally reading a tarot card and jiving off of inspiration on the card) one of the prospective GM's asked me if he could rig the deck before the game started.  I kind of looked at him and asked, "but you have absolute control in this game in almost every possible way, you want to rig the last remaining uncontrollable thing left?"  He just couldn't get it. <br/><br/> <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11" title="cupbearer11"><img alt="cupbearer11" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/394/n8RA473UODIN7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11">cupbearer11</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435919/#Comment_435919" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-28T17:20:39+00:00" title="July 28, 2014  5:20PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 28, 2014 5:22PM by cupbearer11.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @ AsIf..

This is conventionally interpreted, as it has been here, as a reaction against the GM's exercise of authority.  I don't doubt that is true in some cases.  However, there is also something else that can produce much the same apparent behaviour, which is when the GM's channelling of play is too obvious, too blatant, too heavy handed.  The problem here is not that sort of direction is occurring, but that it is breaking the illusion - that it is in fact <i>insufficiently</i> illusionistic.  And that in turn sabotages the players' desire to experience an apprently objective, sensible world without unmissable intervention.<br/><br/>One of the reasons that this may arise is that so many iconic characters in linear media, which players often emulate, are of the reluctant stamp, who have to be cajoled, persuaded, blackmailed, or otherwise pressured into setting off on the path to adventure. Not very many people, IME, create characters of the type who instantly and enthusiastically volunteer to carry the ring into Mordor, like the class suckup.  This dynamic, which occurs entirely within the fiction, rather than arising from any kind of principled objection or agenda conflict, can create excatly the sort of at-and-mouse relationship between the GM and players that is mentioned above, without implying anything at all about a breakdown of trust or an adversarial attitude.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435931/#Comment_435931" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-28T19:24:54+00:00" title="July 28, 2014  7:24PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a resident King of Grognards I feel I'd be remiss if I didn't chime in.<br/><br/>First and foremost, I believe there is very little objective in anything, especially things like game playing. I find it's all just subjective preference. I've met all types of people, and found they're entirely different at a fundamental level. Because of that I never bother to attempt to influence. I merely relate facts, or my own biased preferences and experiences, and then let people do as they will with it.<br/><br/>While I can't say for certain from your limited description, I think it's likely that I'm exactly the type of GM you're talking about, and that most of the many games I lead or play in are of that style (by conscious choice of the participants btw). When I started gaming (1980ish, I was 8 at the time) I was just learning, and obviously didn't go to the lengths I do now. I used mostly purchased modules, tried to adhere to rules more closely, was far more strictly railroady, and hadn't learned the lessons that adapted my style. I'd say by the time I was 18 I'd settled into where I am today. Very little has changed in the last 24 years, mostly because there hasn't been any need.<br/><br/>I'll do my best to offer examples &amp; descriptions, and attempt to answer your questions. If I'm going to be DM'ing a game this is my normal method. <br/><br/>First and foremost I learn the system. This means reading every word that exists for the system, probably several times. I study it. I break down the mechanics to understand the underlying math. I analyze the subsystems. I categorize, and relate it to other games I know better. I attack it, and beat it into utter submission (including house rules and mods where necessary). <br/><br/>Next up I gather players. This means understanding the people I play with enough to make an educated guess at how they'd relate to the system, and vice versa. I'll ask who is interested, provide a synopsis of the system, and gauge reactions. Then I'll arrange meeting with them, individually or in a group, and ask what they're looking for from the game. I'll also ask if they have initial character concepts they're going to be interested in.<br/><br/>Third step is writing the adventure. I generally do both an overall campaign synopsis and an outline of a  specific adventure within it. That lets me place the specific into the general, but also see how the general needs to be hinted at from within the specific. I also make an effort to customize it around any initial character ideas, and based upon the desires of the players.<br/><br/>So the campaign is the actual story I'm trying to tell. It would be the overall novel. The adventures, like individual chapters, are a combination of how to relate the story, and what the players want to experience. Success or failure within it all is going to be threefold: chance, player skill, and my balancing of difficulty. <br/><br/>Next I'll get with the players and actually make the characters with them, offering my suggestions and insights relating to the overall campaign. At this point they'll be expected to provide back story, a roadmap, etc. Then I'll take these specifics back to the adventure and campaign design and integrate all the elements with each other. This should produce a final adventure ready to play.<br/><br/>That adventure will be an extremely detailed 'mini-sandbox' with numerous plots and events happening simultaneously that relate in some way to the overall campaign and at least one of the characters. I'll have pages of npcs (with backstories and mannerisms), locations, demographics, encounters, tricks/traps/puzzles, and so on. How the players proceed through each adventure is up to them, however the story elements within the campaign are going to happen regardless, so the players can be a part of it to impact the outcomes, or ignore it and let it happen. The further they go afield, the less prepared the area will be, and therefore the less detailed, real (and imo fun) the adventure will be. <br/><br/>That last is a fundamental truth of the playstyle. People who play this way want details, and generally some degree of simulation. Yes we're telling stories, and roleplaying...having conversations, evolving plots, and so on. However it is the detail items that 'make it' for them in the same way realism elements and details can make or break a book or show.<br/><br/>The above would probably take about 2-4 weeks, but happens while we're playing other stuff. Once I've established the system and overalls each weeks adventure will usually require 5-15 hours of prep time on my part. This is writing the adventure, working out details, preparing handouts and props, considering likely alternatives, and so on.<br/><br/>Between adventures players will be asked for further input. They can largely shape the next adventure, or at least the options within it. Over and over again it goes like this. However, within each adventure (and for the overall campaign) certain elements must be fixed both to provide the detail people crave, and to tell a coherent story. Players don't have to participate, but 95% of the time they seem to want to. As I've said in other threads it's the difference between improv, and a movie or novel. Both are fun, but they're not the same, and one can never fully create the experience of the other. <br/><br/>So what specifically does this style provide (mind you other styles may provide some or all of these in differing ways):<br/><br/>1. Coherent story/plot with direction and unity of purpose (infinite avenues often results in fracturing or stasis).<br/>2. Details and fullness (which often result in more options for players, and richer, unexpected turns).<br/>3. Integrated sub-plots (often cleverly or subtly achieved).<br/>4. Preparation allowing for rapid adaptation within the prepared scope (through familiarity of system, character, player, campaign, and adventure).<br/>5. Ease of epic length campaigns (can and have plotted 1st-30th level taking several years across a single evolving story).<br/><br/>I would point out that this is not limited to old school games, though old school games often expected this style. I run Mouse Guard the same way, with some modification. I've seen AD&amp;D run in near total sandbox focused on narrative. The one doesn't necessitate the other. <br/><br/>I realize this is somewhat general. If you have specific questions about some element, or need specific examples, just say so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435937/#Comment_435937" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-28T20:17:12+00:00" title="July 28, 2014  8:17PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a great thread!<br/><br/>My two cents: YMMV, of course, but whenever I've been in a game with an obvious railroad, I've had trouble making the "jump on the train" approach work. Either the other players or sometimes even the GM (!!) will make it hard to actually get going on the adventure. It's like there's this ritualistic formula we have to play out (the Campbellian call to action or whatever). And that's why I, personally, can't get anything out of this playstyle: even if I'm entirely willing to play along, no actual play happens for a very long time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nikolai" title="Nikolai"><img alt="Nikolai" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nikolai">Nikolai</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435940/#Comment_435940" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-28T20:40:37+00:00" title="July 28, 2014  8:40PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting thread. I've experienced very positive railroaded play, but as a GM I really can't do it. I simply don't have the time for the prep involved. <br/><br/>Railroading can definitely be a fun mode of play, but the one thing that helped our group when we played in this way was player buy in. Our GM at the time made it very clear before the campaign began that every session was going to be a pre-prepared short-story with 2-3 set piece battles, with a story development much like a TV show episode. Everyone got behind this and we had a great time. This was D&amp;D 3.5 E6 by the way.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not sure what the best term for this is, but I hesitate to call this illusionism because there really was no illusion in this campaign. We had already laid out the social contract and there were no major conflicts. Everyone knew what this campaign was about and understood that exercising narrative control was solely a GM decision.<br/><br/>The main appeal of this was interacting with colorful NPCs involved in this week's drama and outwitting the monsters and bad guys on the battlefield in encounters with good tactics and character optimization (and with the plot armor taken off, several character deaths occurred in this campaign).<br/><br/>I can't stress enough how important player buy in is. Being clear and concise about what the game is about and what roles the players and GM play in all of it reduces frustration and confusion, allowing both the players and GM to focus on the fun parts.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11" title="cupbearer11"><img alt="cupbearer11" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/394/n8RA473UODIN7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11">cupbearer11</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435941/#Comment_435941" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-28T20:42:50+00:00" title="July 28, 2014  8:42PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I totally get that Deliverator.  I once had a one on one session of Changleing the dreaming about a guy who runs out of his psychiatric medication and his porn watching teddy bear sidekick (this was before TED!!!), and how they get wrapped up in some changeling shenanigans.   I was playing with a guy who refused, absolutely REFUSED to bite the hook.  He refused to interact with the teddy bear, refused to get involved in the shenigans... spent the whole weekend (in game) avoiding anything changeling related and then finally got a hold of his psyciatrist on monday morning at his office, got more medication to stop his "delusions"  (which weren't delusions, he was a changeling...).  It was 3 am and my head was literally on the floor i was so tired, and i finally realized that it was time to go home, so i said:  "you finally get the medication.  And dr. so and so decides to give you extra refills in case this dreadful occurence might happen again. thankfully it never does."  THE END."  <br/><br/>It was super annoying but.... but... but... the thing is, why not, right?  he was playing his character, he was the super super super reluctant hero, and I just couldn't force myself to force him, so he he got his objective, he won the game, i mean, who wants to be a changeling anyways?  Although then again why do we play games right?  I suppose though, this guy liked being a successful business man, more than getting into changeling shenanigans.  Maybe we should have roleplayed a game about that!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11" title="cupbearer11"><img alt="cupbearer11" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/394/n8RA473UODIN7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11">cupbearer11</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435942/#Comment_435942" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-28T20:57:48+00:00" title="July 28, 2014  8:57PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/warriormonk">@warriormonk</a>, hey thanks, yes, the investment is definitely there, like i said, its fun, i don't think i would (or probably could) do it again at this scale, were all in our early thirties so kids and marriages and houses and jobs kind of get in the way (and should maybe lol..) but yeah, its a fun hobby for sure. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11" title="cupbearer11"><img alt="cupbearer11" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/394/n8RA473UODIN7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11">cupbearer11</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435943/#Comment_435943" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-28T21:08:13+00:00" title="July 28, 2014  9:08PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 28, 2014 9:19PM by cupbearer11.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Nikolai">@Nikolai</a><br/>yeah buy in is serious.  although your game sounds even more railroady than i though possible haha...

Seems like a bunch of things going on at once in those games you mentioned, <a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a>:<br/><br/>1) Successful illusionism -- I think we can all agree that some folks enjoy this, some hate it, and for some it depends on other factors.  Seems like WM's old groups mostly like it?<br/><br/>2) Glitchy illusionism -- for people who like successful illusionism, seeing the wires can produce all sorts of reactions from helpful ("let me help you cover that up, GM") to game-ending ("my engagement is ruined and I hereby withdraw all genuine investment; perhaps I will grief you now").  Seems like WM's old groups are in between?<br/><br/>3) Battle of wits -- the players and GM jockey for advantage in the game, as adjudicated (at least in part) by something other than "just the GM" or "just the players".  This is common as a fail state for other types of play, in which case it is rarely fun, because adjudication is usually an ad hoc mess.  However, with an actual agreed-upon and consistently applicable method of adjudication, this can be fun.  Seems like WM's old groups enjoy this at times?<br/><br/>As far as I can tell, those first two have been discussed aplenty, but that third one remains a bit mysterious.<br/><br/>Suppose the players find a loophole in the rules, and use it to argue that their characters can accomplish something the GM doesn't want.  What's the rationale whereby the GM chooses between:<br/>- Saying "that doesn't work" with no explanation<br/>- Saying "that doesn't work" with some invented fictional explanation<br/>- Saying "sure, that works", but then instantly rendering it insignificant ("just as you complete the ritual to create the Cosmic Blade, a condor swoops in, grabs it, and flies off") <br/>- Genuinely allowing the accomplishment to stand<br/><br/>What could possibly make the GM stop asserting his will on the proceedings and say "okay you win this one"?<br/><br/>WarriorMonk, do you have any idea, for the groups you wrote about?<br/><br/>The only answer I've encountered looks like this:<br/><br/><i>The group culture values clever rules-use (perhaps inherited from playing Magic: the Gathering together), to the point that thwarting clever rules-use is a much bigger social faux pas than anything the GM might do to the fiction alone.</i><br/><br/>I have no idea if that technique -- "honor clever rules-use above all else" -- can thrive in any other contexts, and whether it's totally functional in this one or merely a crutch for when the illusionism gets glitchy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435951/#Comment_435951" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-29T02:29:30+00:00" title="July 29, 2014  2:29AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "24 new post".

This is my from my own theory of engagement, but JRPG are like movies, where you get investment from learning about that character (JRPGs are more focused on relations). WRPGs are instead about learning through actions.<br/><br/>A Swedish game called Bl\xe4ck got a mechanic where you get an extra 1d10 in rolls if you describe the action by talking about the character in third person, mentioning your name. So you can say "I want to leap outside the window to escape the guards", but you will get an extra d10 if you say "Gronard will jump out the window".\n<blockquote>We found that the results were almost exactly 50/50.</blockquote>\nThat is really interesting, and I will take this with me in my <b>This Is Pulp</b>. The players shouldn't play out the characters but if 50 % of all people want to do that, then I have to make sure they understand that it's not the purpose of the game. Perhaps I should use the same thinking as Bl\xe4ck to make the players distance themselves from their character. Hmm, this is a serious flaw in my design.

Can you give us a "best of my memory" description of a typical, a successful, and a failed game segment with them, as you experienced them?  </blockquote>\nOk, the first games were really good, we made simple characters and portrayed them. It was the first time most of us played D&amp;D and since our previous game was a vampire campaign whose GM was an actor, our roleplaying came highly influenced by a tendence of hand-waving the system to increase the chance of epicness. 10 sessions later, the GM had enough of us jumping through obstacles and solving combats through diplomacy, bluffing, thinking out of the box and doing other tactical stuff withouth using much of the system.<br/><br/>That's when he decided to take off the velvet gloves and railroad us into combats and using the system to limit our movements and chances. We ended up trying to fight entangled against invisible enemies that kept casting area spells and had damage resistance on top of a untouchable AC, and then the players who hadn't min-maxed found out their characters were useless to engage the fiction. We just kept being beaten and watched how powergamers in the group stole the spotlight, or got ourselves humilliated when we finally managed to try something and kept rolling 1's. Even when we managed to get a critical it didn't meant much because we hadn'e optimized our damage output and even doubling it, that only meant 2 hp less to the opponent after substracting the damage reduction.<br/><br/>I recall a battle against some kind of demon that had that monstruous AC and DR on top of it. My monk (second character and first attempt at optimization) using his best combat options could only hit it with a 20 and since I was one level away from getting the ability to surpass his DR couldn't do a scratch. So my best chance was to score a crit to make 2 hp of damage. And that always left me in his threat area on his turn, with barely 16 of AC. After his next hit barely killed me and as I watched how my companions struggled but found no way to surpass the creature's defense nor survive his attacks for long, I started to roleplay it like "we have to run while we can, this is gonna be our end!"<br/><br/>The GM asked me why I was telling that and I referred to the facts. Ruleswise, my character had no way to contribute to the battle and the rest of the party could do very little, therefore it was obvious that we had bitten more than we could chew. I was thinking "It's okay, it could happen and it could still be interesting if we run from a monster for once and find another way through. But then the GM just looked at my character sheet and handwave the whole thing telling me that "never mind, let's say your character can hit it, ok?"<br/><br/>I had almost convinced the rest of the players, this wasn't even the final boss and we were wasting resources... but then everyone thought the problem was solved, kept fignting the monster and finally defeated it. I felt cheated. I felt that the GM had pity of my character. Up until then I could accept the railroading and help keep the illusion, but now the GM had showed me that we were being railroaded even into winning whenever he wanted to. <a href="/forums/profile/Contracycle">@Contracycle</a> nailed this above. That was the typical session.<br/><br/>Fill the spaces with several arguments about the rules and loopholes that lasted about 30 min each at least. That's how our worst sessions were. I think this has decreased with the players that still go to his game, but now they are using almost any companion book or additional manual they could found in spanish, turning the game into a munchkin's paradise. The GM is still railroading them left and right and the players are plotting how to destroy his setting, kill each other or at least de-rail the game whenever they can. I think they are at their best now that the group is composed only by players that enjoy that playstyle.<br/><br/>Which is why now I think this playstyle still has something that can be saved. There are still players enjoying the sessions with him after all. He made a couple of mistakes here and there, big deal. I can't consider myself a reliable source of information about his playstyle because I mostly remember the worst parts, as you can see. If everything was completely dysfunctional in his games, nobody would be playing with him today. That's why I think the fun there should be part on the mechanical tinkering with the system, but also in the meta-intrigue part of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435966/#Comment_435966" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-29T10:21:04+00:00" title="July 29, 2014 10:21AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry for the doublepost, but I'd really like to thanks and adress everyone who is giving their input. I actually value all this more than it seems.<br/><br/>I just readed <a href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">@phoenix182</a> post and looks like the GMs I mentioned wanted to be like you, but didn't manage or wanted to do all the work. Our D&amp;D GM seemed to look at the manuals for inspiration and used the stats right from them. His notes limited to the number of the pages and the name of the manuals he needed. It seems the setting we were using was created by another GM for a campaign in which our GM had played as a PC. He was using his now epic PC to railroad us into the quest. Some of us created background for our characters but the GM made the adventure inter-planar and introduced us in a way that severed all our links to our backgrounds. His PC presented himself as a god, but I believe he was a wizard bluffing us into a quest, in a way that smells a lot like Elminster or Tenser from a few modules I readed many years after. Now we think he was trained as a GM in the old school tradition, but didn't saw all the work behind and assumed he could wing it all the time and apply rule zero when not. None of his introductions have been able to motivate players into adventure, nor he tries to anymore. Most players try to collaborate by making a character that could fit and have a real interest in the adventure. If not, some god or another appears to lead them into the plot. So, you can see that he knows the basics, but limps when he has to deal with the details of the system for real, make prep and being responsible with the illusionism.<br/><br/>The other GM actually makes a ton of prep for every campaign he makes. He's got several hand-written books for statistics and things to find and learn in a whole galaxy for his space opera campaign. He keeps stealing plots and twists from every popular and obscure movie, series or comic book he can from both japanese and western culture. He writes a lot in such fashion, creates several organizations and interesting NPCs to handle each one. But math and mechanics are his downfall. Long ago I learned that you just can't hack a mechanic or a system, breake the balance for the sake of making things more impressive and/or controlable, and pretend it's fine. I discovered it while playing his space opera game, where another player and I engaged in a close range duel with submachineguns... and neither of us hit anything for three rounds. I think I hit him with the weapon to kill him. Then I run to do the same to our commander, another PC, who had taken refuge in the kitchen of the lost ship we were exploring. When we got there, this PC had cut a gas pipe with his swords (normal, not laser ones) and use the swords again to ignite the gas into an improvised flamethower that killed two of us instantly and mortally wounded a third one. I think I went into disbelief shock, said thanks for the game and left. We discussed this scene with him later and he admitted that it made no sense to use gas to cook in a spaceship, that our commander should have died too on the moment he ignited the gas, but the scene sounded so cool to him in that moment that he forgot that:<br/><br/>a) I had come to the game to help him as an NPC to advance the story, and to help him get rid of the commander PC whose player was already breaking the system with his character. (He had done so by abusing a house rule that gave xp to anyone who brought snacks to the game or printed stuff for the GM)<br/>b) He kept ranting about players killing each other, when he was the one who introduced several mechanics and setting conditions that pushed PvP into the fiction, no matter how much the players tried to regroup.<br/>c) My character was a member of a secret group who didn't have too many reasons to kill the comander or anyone, but had a cover of a character who did. He used that to push me into trying to kill our commander.<br/><br/>Later I also remembered that he had already written a scene to be played 30 sessions later, where our commander found that he had fought for nothing. Most probably, he just wanted to save the PC who had given him so much trouble only to see the face of the player when they reached that scene.<br/><br/>Well, at least this guy is reasonable once you tell him the same thing over and over for the course of four years. We helped him to improve his system, redacted a field manual for the PCs based on 3:16 to avoid players abandoning each other once combat started. Also made everyone agree on sharing info to make a common database open to anyone, since a lot of players were discovering secrets of the setting but taking to the grave with them. That was the thing that kept the story from advancing. But then the campaign stalled for personal reasons and now he's running a Vampire campaign like it's D&amp;D (it's modern era but the players somehow still end up dungeon crawling). He started to complain about PCs leveling way too fast, so he searched for every additional skill he could add from every manual and ended with a two-page long skillset, as a solution to make the players distribute all his points in different skills. The answer of some of the players was to keep minmaxing and look for loopholes in the manual.<br/><br/>Ok, I think I certainly should stop giving more info about them, I can't help but remember all the bad stuff time and time again, and I really want to focus on the meta-intrigue, the duel of witts. Does anyone have good anecdotes about that kind of game?

I've experienced very positive railroaded play, but as a GM I really can't do it. I simply don't have the time for the prep involved. <br/><br/>Railroading can definitely be a fun mode of play, but the one thing that helped our group when we played in this way was player buy in. Our GM at the time made it very clear before the campaign began that every session was going to be a pre-prepared short-story with 2-3 set piece battles, with a story development much like a TV show episode. Everyone got behind this and we had a great time. This was D&amp;D 3.5 E6 by the way.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not sure what the best term for this is, but I hesitate to call this illusionism because there really was no illusion in this campaign. We had already laid out the social contract and there were no major conflicts. Everyone knew what this campaign was about and understood that exercising narrative control was solely a GM decision.<br/><br/>The main appeal of this was interacting with colorful NPCs involved in this week's drama and outwitting the monsters and bad guys on the battlefield in encounters with good tactics and character optimization (and with the plot armor taken off, several character deaths occurred in this campaign).<br/><br/>I can't stress enough how important player buy in is. Being clear and concise about what the game is about and what roles the players and GM play in all of it reduces frustration and confusion, allowing both the players and GM to focus on the fun parts.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nOk, this is more close to what I'm looking for, there's definitely something here, something that creates healthy gameplay. If the GM is open about his playstyle, how he will do the prep and what is to be expected, that doesn't automatically have to mean that the excitement of the exploration dissapears. If the GM says that the game is going to be lethal, I expect my character to die if I don't run in time. If the system is gonig to be engaged in full power that tells me that powergaming is going to be meaningful, that's also fun on it's own.<br/><br/>This is really good, keep it coming, I know and understand a lot about Illusionism, and I know it's price. But I really love to know more about playing without it, engaging the system and playing a fair duel of witts.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435974/#Comment_435974" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-29T11:28:11+00:00" title="July 29, 2014 11:28AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Sorry for the doublepost, but I'd really like to thanks and adress everyone who is giving their input.

Not that I think either my way or either of theirs (or anyone elses) is objectively better or worse, but it sounds like theirs is geared a bit more towards gamists and a bit of meta with more strictly constained stories (which some do prefer) while mine tries to be a more player participating and open-ended simulation in the same basic method as theirs.<br/><br/>I've been insanely lucky in my life and have very seldom encountered much negative railroading, except among newer DMs (which seems normal for most people). I've also never suffered for want of available games or players.

Seems like a bunch of things going on at once in those games you mentioned, <a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a>:<br/><br/>1) Successful illusionism -- I think we can all agree that some folks enjoy this, some hate it, and for some it depends on other factors.  Seems like WM's old groups mostly like it?<br/></blockquote>\nYeah, they love good illusionism, but the guys who still play there don't seem to care the current illusion sucks. They are definitely there for other reasons.\n<blockquote><br/>2) Glitchy illusionism -- for people who like successful illusionism, seeing the wires can produce all sorts of reactions from helpful ("let me help you cover that up, GM") to game-ending ("my engagement is ruined and I hereby withdraw all genuine investment; perhaps I will grief you now").  Seems like WM's old groups are in between?<br/></blockquote>\nLooks like what rests between those points is a sort of "I want revenge on the GM, let the duel of witts begin!"  That seems to be the motivation of the group that still plays with them, as they keep complaining to us about the game, but keep returning.\n<blockquote><br/>3) Battle of wits -- the players and GM jockey for advantage in the game, as adjudicated (at least in part) by something other than "just the GM" or "just the players".  This is common as a fail state for other types of play, in which case it is rarely fun, because adjudication is usually an ad hoc mess.  However, with an actual agreed-upon and consistently applicable method of adjudication, this can be fun.  Seems like WM's old groups enjoy this at times?<br/><br/>As far as I can tell, those first two have been discussed aplenty, but that third one remains a bit mysterious.<br/><br/>Suppose the players find a loophole in the rules, and use it to argue that their characters can accomplish something the GM doesn't want.  What's the rationale whereby the GM chooses between:<br/>- Saying "that doesn't work" with no explanation<br/>- Saying "that doesn't work" with some invented fictional explanation<br/>- Saying "sure, that works", but then instantly rendering it insignificant ("just as you complete the ritual to create the Cosmic Blade, a condor swoops in, grabs it, and flies off") <br/>- Genuinely allowing the accomplishment to stand<br/><br/>What could possibly make the GM stop asserting his will on the proceedings and say "okay you win this one"?<br/><br/>WarriorMonk, do you have any idea, for the groups you wrote about?<br/><br/>The only answer I've encountered looks like this:<br/><br/><i>The group culture values clever rules-use (perhaps inherited from playing Magic: the Gathering together), to the point that thwarting clever rules-use is a much bigger social faux pas than anything the GM might do to the fiction alone.</i><br/><br/>I have no idea if that technique -- "honor clever rules-use above all else" -- can thrive in any other contexts, and whether it's totally functional in this one or merely a crutch for when the illusionism gets glitchy.</blockquote>\nThese guys have a consistant rationale of sorts. The first rule applied is the one the GM remembers. If players remember it differently, or it's applied in a situation to deny them of an option to solve a problem (most probably an option never foreseen by the GM) they argue using common sense. If that doesn't convince the GM or the players, they go to the book. If the rule clearly states something favoring either one, the game goes on and the GM tries another approach. If the rule isn't clear, no amount of common sense or group pressure may work for any of these two GMs. They usually give up after half an hour of arguments or more only to render the whole thing insignificant as a revenge, at least jokingly.<br/><br/>Finding loopholes, power gaming and carefully making questions and stating actions and reactions is rewarded with spotlight. The GM tends to build over it to prepare a counterattack for the players, turning it against them. Everything else gets somewhat punished, is irrelevant, happens out of scene, etc. Actually, this could have been okay if we didn't had to learn it from experience instead of knowing it in advance. The way it happened, got our expectations about the game crushed.<br/><br/>But again, taking the dysfunctional play out of it, we could be playing a collaborative honorful duel of wits, using additional dice rolls/flip a coin to adjudicate instead of interrupting the game to check the book. Anyone could check the book out of his turn and keep things prepared to justify their actions and possible outcome in front of the GM. The GM could made a similar thing when doing his prep. The GM could straight tell the players where does he plan to take the railroad, or signal them whenever he wants to do so they can jump on the train and relax. If we're clear from the start about what is going to be the fun of the game, what's going to be rewarded and what not, then we're ready to have the same kind of fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435980/#Comment_435980" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-29T12:30:55+00:00" title="July 29, 2014 12:30PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I can only say that I don't think the overall playstyle should be discounted, as it has merits, when well implemented, and when the players are interested in being a part of it.</blockquote>\nI agree. Well implemented is one of the three keys here. The second is simply to be sensitive to the player's needs. The third is to foster communication and be honest about your gaming style, whatever it is.

This sort of thing is fascinating, revealing, and thought-provoking. Please keep it coming!<br/><br/>I've been wanting to post a bit of an aside in the meantime, and just got around to it now. I hope I won't derail the fantastic discussion which is ongoing. But I feel that this is important - at least to me. Here is the bit that got me thinking:\n<blockquote>In a sense, you're railroading all the time.  The difference is a matter of grainsize.  Every time a GM personally decides what the interpretation of a roll or the next event to occur is, they are creating a tiny little section of railroad and running the players down it. <br/></blockquote>\nIt seems a lot of people are agreeing with this statement. I've seen it a lot in RPG discussions: "We're all railroading! When you frame a scene as a GM, you're railroading!" "You're railroading, too. You just have more 'branches' in your railroad!" "It's the same shit! Come on, man! We all do it."<br/><br/>This has always rung hollow to me. I'm willing to accept that my personal view of "railroading" is different from other peoples' (although I think it's pretty close to the Forge definition for Illusionism, for what it's worth), but this is how I see the issue:<br/><br/>No. It's not the same. It's not about scope or scale, or how many decision points are built into a game.<br/><br/>It's about the social interactions between the people, and about how the System handles significant decisions. To me, railroading happens when someone (usually the GM - though not always) doesn't engage with a meaningful (and "game legal") decision or move by another player, and takes action to negate it. (Kind of like "blocking" in improv.)<br/><br/>It's fundamentally different from doing the stuff that a GM is supposed to do, like framing scenes or presenting adversity. It's about a) not engaging with the people at the table, not honouring their choices, first, and b) not responding to their input into the game (valid "moves"), by making your own moves instead.<br/><br/>In a GMed RPG, often it is the GM's role to provide challenge and danger: "There's a huge monster guarding the entrance to the tomb! It wants to fight!" That's not railroading. The game simply *wouldn't run* if the GM didn't say anything like this: the GM *has* to provide something for the players to interact with.<br/><br/>But if the players make a decision - "No, we don't want to risk a fight. Let's go back to the bandits' camp, where we left the Princess" - and the GM chooses to invalidate that decision by saying: "Uh, on the way to the camp, you meet a huge monster! It attacks you!/You're going to have to fight it if you want to get to the camp!"... that's when railroading happens.<br/><br/><br/>1. The GM is ignoring the player's decision to engage with the game a certain way. The players say, "Screw this dungeon. We want to start a cult in the city, instead!" The GM - the actual, human being at the table - ignores what they said altogether and tries to force them to keep playing the scenario she has in mind ("Uh, there's a huge storm outside, totally unpassable. The only way back to the city... is to pass through the dungeon I designed").<br/><br/>The players are making choices, and the GM simply *does not* accept those choices. She's not listening to the players; she flat-out ignores what they say. That's one half of the picture.<br/><br/><br/>2. The other half is not engaging with the System in the right places. The GM is supposed to make certain decisions (like how strong the enemy is). The players are supposed to respond to that, by making decisions ("Ok, this monster is too tough for my 7th-level Monk. I can only hurt it on a critical hit, and even then I only do 2 points of damage. Let's run away!"). That's the players' move in this game.<br/><br/>In a railroading situation, the GM invalidates those valid game moves, by misapplying his or her powers of authority to change things to the way she wants them to be: "Ok, never mind. Let's say your Monk gets a +10 bonus to hit, just for this fight. Can we get back to it, now? Roll initiative!"<br/><br/>That's the GM saying, "No, you're wrong. I don't accept your choice to run away. I want you to make the 'keep fighting' move here. You're going to keep fighting this monster. Here, look, I modified things to keep you happy for now. Now get back to rolling those dice! Go!"<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>In essence, to put it in Vincent's Apocalypse World lingo:<br/><br/>Roleplaying is a conversation. It's like taking turns, except it's not exactly taking turns, you know?<br/><br/>The players talk and they something, and then they turn to you, and it's your turn to make a move. You respond to them.<br/><br/>So what's going on here?<br/><br/>*** Some GMs decide to break the conversation, and they start making their moves when <i>it's not their turn</i>. ***<br/><br/>They're trying to play on the players' turn, too. (And that's exactly why the players feel unhappy about it. They can feel the conversation isn't going right. They're not getting to talk - or, if they are, no one's listening.)<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>That's how I would describe railroading. Not a matter of scale or scope. It's when the GM a) invalidates the social contract in play (e.g. that the players' strategic decisions should have weight, or ignores their interests in what they choose to engage with in the game altogether), and b) breaks the expected System in play, by making moves (and making decisions) in places where it's <i>the players' turn</i>.<br/><br/>That's how I see it.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436005/#Comment_436005" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-29T23:41:42+00:00" title="July 29, 2014 11:41PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>An aside to the aside:<br/><br/>In a Participationist/functional version of this, the players are on board with it, so the System has essentially been drifted/modified/whatever to work this way, and everyone's happy with it. <br/><br/>For example:\n<blockquote>Our GM at the time made it very clear before the campaign began that every session was going to be a pre-prepared short-story with 2-3 set piece battles, with a story development much like a TV show episode. Everyone got behind this and we had a great time. This was D&amp;D 3.5 E6 by the way.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not sure what the best term for this is, but I hesitate to call this illusionism because there really was no illusion in this campaign. We had already laid out the social contract and there were no major conflicts. Everyone knew what this campaign was about and understood that exercising narrative control was solely a GM decision.<br/></blockquote>\nYou can see here how the GM is control of the plot, but everyone's on board with it. The System/procedures of play have been modified to work this way, and everyone's on the same page. That allows everyone to "play along". It's functional. Everyone's playing the same game. It's not a rigged contest, like a soccer game where we tell you that the team who scores the most goals wins, but at the end if the game we apply a 10-goal "bonus" to one of the teams for "great uniform design" to calculate who *actually* won.<br/><br/>So: cool. Everyone's on the same page, everyone knows how to be an effective player, what to expect, how to have fun. But that's in total contrast to what WarriorMonk is describing, with complaining and whining and frustration and people actively trying to undermine each other. <br/><br/>(And this is why WM has to ask *us*, online: "How do I become an effective player in this context, and actually have a good time?" And this is also why we can't give him a straight answer. Because there isn't one. The game's rigged. We can't tell him how to be a good soccer player on his team until we know about the "great uniform design" bonus - but the GM doesn't want to tell us about that, because s/he wants to hold on to the ability to change the nature of this "bonus" later.)<br/><br/>(The "Participationist" game is the one where someone leans over to you at the beginning of the match and whispers in your ear, "Hey, just so you know, it's really important that we *look* like we're trying to win the game, so run fast and play hard. But really, we all know that the judges are looking at our outfits, and will give the better-dressed team a significant bonus. So we've spent the last two weeks designing these uniforms. Do you think there's anything we could add to make them look better? Ok, now you know what's up - let's play!")<br/><br/>Although I really liked Dave's question: is there an aspect of this meta-game Duel of Wits between the GM and the players, over who surprises who the most - or who outwits who - which is potentially fun, and, if so, what does it look like, how can we emphasize it and make it functional?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436006/#Comment_436006" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-29T23:43:52+00:00" title="July 29, 2014 11:43PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm really enjoying all the detailed accounts of people's roleplaying groups and practices in this thread.

But personally I prefer to keep my definitions of aesthetic qualia non-exclusive and non-categorical.  Firstly because categories don't actually exist, we make them up and they're blurry and they change over time and from culture to culture, and secondly because such line-drawing often becomes ideology, causing needless arguments and unfortunate blind-spots to arise.<br/><br/>And because of that, I prefer to see those issues as orthogonal to each other.  One is a structural issue (system grainsize), the other is a functional one (GM forcefullness).  They interact.  Actually, they interact in exactly the area where the system/designer meets ("fuses with/loads into the RAM of") the human/GM.  So the problems you describe, on my view, are either the result of "reading the system's mind" and getting it <i>wrong,</i> or failing to consider the system's intentions at all.  Why?  <b><i>Ego.</i></b>  That little fucker needs to be silenced.<br/><br/>I don't mind being the ranter in the corner on this one.

They are nothing but useful fictions; they should not be mistaken for reality.  Only individual items (game rules, human beings, etc) exist.

Remember y'all, in the OP and in later posts, <a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a> says he's looking to extract value from this playstyle.  In order to do that, we must first remove any logically-fallacious assumptions we carry, some of which have been brought about by ideologies based on categoricals, which are actually just shorthand, i.e., illusion, not determinative.  In other words, we must stop inducing.  Then we can proceed to analyze the content with as much objectivity as possible.<br/><br/>Case in point: Right next door to us in conceptual artspace, there is an artform called "Interactive Theater" (which may be a misnomer, some call it "Follow-about Theater" but I'll leave that for another discussion).  Interactive Theater pieces vary in the amount of agency given to audience members.  "Tamara" gives you no agency at all (beyond the choice of which actor to follow when a scene ends), while "Ghosts in the Machine" gives you so much agency you can actually affect the outcome of the top-level plotline.  But in both cases, there is still a clear distinction between performers and audience.  And guess what - they're super fun!  They are amazing just as sheer spectacles, even if nothing else, but they can also be deep and profound: they can explore existentialist issues, they can be great social satires, and they provide an experience that is shaped exactly like a typical railroad: wide in the middle, pointy on the top and bottom.  <br/><br/>This is a sister artform, ladies and gentlemen.  She is a direct inheritor of the same media-hybridizing meme we base our own self-definition on.  For an artist with a complex message, she provides an absolutely unique and effective way to make certain types of artistic or thematic statements.  We should be studying her output as much as we study our own (and I can easily think of a dozen more sibling vocations for which the same statement is true).  Don't be prejudicial.  There are artistic applications for everything you can imagine.  Baby, bathwater, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436034/#Comment_436034" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-30T09:32:19+00:00" title="July 30, 2014  9:32AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They're also not games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436035/#Comment_436035" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-30T09:37:20+00:00" title="July 30, 2014  9:37AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 30, 2014 9:47AM by AsIf.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neither are movies or TV shows, but we study them and lift techniques from them.  <br/>(And "<a href="http://asifproductions.com/ghosts.html" rel="nofollow">Ghosts in the Machine</a>" qualifies as a game.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436036/#Comment_436036" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-30T09:47:22+00:00" title="July 30, 2014  9:47AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But I'm not talking about interactive theater.

First thing I said was "True".  <br/>But there's agency and there's agency.<br/><br/>Propositions: <br/>1. There do exist some artistic reasons for railroading that are not ethically wrong.<br/>2. There are ways to think about structure which are not limited to all-or-nothing categorizations.<br/><br/>I think we can agree on those, yes?  <br/><br/>From there it follows that we might deliberately introduce railroady segments of varying size into larger structures.  This could be done for purposes of exposition, flashback/forward, goal-setting, catch-up, retcon, etc etc.  This is pretty much what a "cutaway" is in a videogame.  There's nothing wrong with that, provided your artistic statement is such-and-such and your players know what kind of game this is.  (Brainstorming, that's just one example.)<br/><br/>I am trying to point the conversation back to the brainstorming part, and away from the rather obvious "don't be a dick" part.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436040/#Comment_436040" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-30T10:17:46+00:00" title="July 30, 2014 10:17AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 30, 2014 10:23AM by Paul_T.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tod (AsIf),<br/><br/>I feel like we're talking past each other. I don't disagree with your desire to erase lines and explore new creative space. That's all good and wonderful.<br/><br/>(Incidentally, I have no idea what "Ghosts in the Machine" is - is it <a href="http://asifproductions.com/ghosts.html" rel="nofollow">THIS</a>? That sounds very cool! Is there a more detailed write-up anywhere? As it is, it's very hard for me to imagine what the event actually looked like, what players did, and so on.)<br/><br/>But the whole point I'm trying to make here is that the problem isn't a categorical one (e.g. that one player CANNOT have the control over the resolution of a certain game aspect), but a social one. The problem isn't the GM deciding how things go; it's about how that's communicated to the players.<br/><br/>In interactive theatre, and the write-up I linked to, I don't see any misleading expectations. As a player/audience member in that medium I wouldn't feel "cockblocked" (as Adam put it, above). There's a system in play, and each person involved is playing their assigned role and making the decisions that they are responsible for. For it to qualify as some kind of "railroading", someone would have to go into the audience and tell the players what outcome to vote for... and <i>then</i> also enforce that choice despite player/audience disagreement. <br/><br/>However, I do also realize that there could be some blurred lines here. For instance, you mention "red herrings" in the Plotlines section of your mini-review - there could be room here for some intentionally misleading material. Likewise, I can imagine an "interactive theatre" where the audience votes for a certain outcome, but the show has been rigged for a certain outcome every time. The "voting process", and, perhaps, the ensuing frustration of the voters, is designed to be part of the experience.<br/><br/>But I still feel that there is a line (blurry though it may be) around the way this is presented. If I purchase a ticket to an "interactive theatre experience", I'm not going with the same expectations of agency that I would going into a Dogs in the Vineyard game. But maybe that's on me? I don't know.<br/><br/>So your point is taken. There's definitely food for thought there.<br/><br/>(Edit: In a railroading situation in a tabletop game, though, at least for me, the line can be drawn in a pretty specific place. I go talk to the GM after/during the game, and ask, "Hey, so how could this have gone? Was this scene 'rigged'?" How does the GM respond? If s/he is capable of saying that, yes, this is how the game works, it's all good. I can decide whether to play or not. But in many play cultures, you're <i>not allowed to do that</i>. The GM must smile and pretend this isn't the case - "Oh, no, it could have gone so many other ways!" - and keep up the charade <i>even outside the scope of the game</i>. Often, the GM herself doesn't even realize she's doing it: she's got herself fooled, too. I used to run games this way, I remember. I had a hypothetically open-ended situation, but I knew the system well enough, and knew my players well enough, that effectively I knew how it would turn out, or I had a way to turn any possible outcome into the next desired plot point. At some point I realized that I'd been running a game for months with very creative and proactive players, and there were *no surprises* for me: that's when I knew something was fishy.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436041/#Comment_436041" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-30T10:17:50+00:00" title="July 30, 2014 10:17AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 30, 2014 11:59AM by Rickard.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>They're also not games.</blockquote>\nI think there should be an equivalent to the Goodwin rule in game discussions that says that when someone says "That's not a (roleplaying) game", that person has lost the discussion. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436042/#Comment_436042" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-30T10:21:08+00:00" title="July 30, 2014 10:21AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love you guys.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436045/#Comment_436045" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-30T10:35:02+00:00" title="July 30, 2014 10:35AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 30, 2014 11:12AM by AsIf.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I have no idea what "Ghosts in the Machine" is - is it <a href="http://asifproductions.com/ghosts.html" rel="nofollow">THIS</a>?</blockquote>Yup.  A simple way to explain the structure is: One big railroad with two end terminals on the top layer, lots of little floating railroads in the middle layer (predetermined shapes with plug-in objects), and lots of little pressure points and narrative microgames all over the place on the bottom.  On each level the elements (smaller and smaller) were designed to <i>affect</i> the tiers above them without <i>destroying</i> them.  It mostly worked.  Took a year to design it.  And it is a roleplaying game, at least as much as <i>Fiasco</i> and more than <i>Microscope</i>.<br/><br/>The reason I use the pejorative word "railroad" on my own piece here (despite the two count em two endings) is because of the top tier's Cutaway Scenes: eight of them were scheduled to happen regardless of the situation in the room, the lights would go down, a spotlight would hit the actors in the scene, and everyone in the room at that moment would literally stop and watch them.  This was done to deliver major plotpoints, to increase tension and propel the top tier, in fact this was effectively the skeleton of the top tier.<br/><br/>Anyway, I appreciate that you appreciate that what I'm trying to do is to blur (actually remove) lines.  That's all I'm asking you to do, really.  From there we can begin to answer WM's question, instead of arguing about definitions to which we know there are perfectly valid exceptions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436046/#Comment_436046" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-30T10:58:58+00:00" title="July 30, 2014 10:58AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>They're also not games.</blockquote>\nI think there should be an equivalent to the Goodwin rule in game discussions that says that when someone says "That's not a (roleplaying) game", that person has lost the discussion.</blockquote>\nThrowing out "tabletop RPGs" as a category is unlikely to be useful. Sure, there may be blurry lines in some places, I think everyone's acknowledging that, but there has to be some way to put things in boxes somehow. Adam and Paul's point about Tod's mention of interactive theater pieces wasn't to denigrate their existence, in fact they reacted quite positively. However, the fact that they would have really different expectations going into such a situation, because it is, in fact, *not a tabletop RPG*, isn't hair-splitting.<br/><br/>And of course, within the scope of tabletop RPGs, there are many different types of agency one could hope or expect to have. The problem with what WM describes is that, from what we can tell, really no one but the GM has any agency within the game. All the min-maxing, etc., is a combination of a charade and a *social*-level power struggle. In fact, those "games" are *more* railroady (in the sense of denying agency) than the interactive theater and other related hobbies.<br/><br/>As an aside, I also think there are some productive ways to think about 4E D&amp;D by <i>throwing out</i> the assumption that it's a roleplaying game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_436047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436047/#Comment_436047" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-30T11:00:07+00:00" title="July 30, 2014 11:00AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 30, 2014 11:02AM by contracycle.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Paul's description of railroading is why I find illusionism (not participationism) ethically troublesome.

When I say "You're basically cock-blocking," read that as "IF YOU DO WHAT PAUL IS DESCRIBING, THEN... you're basically cock-blocking." I'm not telling any particular real person that they're doing anything. This is all hypotheticals.<br/><br/>Here's what I am saying:<br/><br/>IF you're taking away agency from your players... and IF you're doing it without their consent, tacit or direct or otherwise... THEN I think that's ethically problematic.<br/><br/>If you're not doing those things, yay, awesome. Have fun.<br/>If you are doing those things, and you're still having fun, yay, awesome. Just don't do that to me, please. I find it ethically problematic and would be /annoyed/ to find out you were doing it TO ME without my permission.<br/><br/>If you're doing those things and the players actually want it, and you're pretty sure of that because you know your friends really well, but you've never actually spoken about it because it'd ruin the magic of what you do, FINE. I'm cool with that. I don't entirely get it, because my friends and I talk about this shit ALL THE TIME and it never ruins the magic for us, but to each his own, yaknow?<br/><br/>I am NOT assuming that the GM is blocking the desires of the players. I am saying, IF the GM blocks the desires of the players, please do it with their consent (tacit or direct or otherwise).<br/><br/><br/>I also think the jargon around illusionism and participationism has drifted a lot. Some old Forge folks use them the way contracycle uses them. Some other old Forge folks like me use them the way I use them. I find the "matter of degree" definition to be basically useless. I find the "participationism is illusionism with players participating in it, i.e. consenting" to be more obvious and useful a distinction. But jargon aside, you know what we mean, we know what you mean, and as long as we clarify, can't we all just stop bickering about the definitions? I'll try to stop jargon-bitching if you will. Paul clarified with "/functional" so we'd all know which one he meant.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436055/#Comment_436055" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-30T11:31:03+00:00" title="July 30, 2014 11:31AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I've ceased adding value to this thread and should bow out.

So which is the good one and which is the bad one? I don't know.<br/></blockquote>\nNeither.  They are both functional as long as everyone goes into it knowing what they are signing up for, and wishing to play in that manner.  Although AFAIK, participationism is a largely theoretical construct which I'm not sure has ever been observed "in the wild".<br/><br/>If you must have a perjoratrive, then it is "railroading", whose definitive characteristic is the lack of consent.  However it's so often conflated with illusionism that I've taken to defending even that from time to time.\n<blockquote>But, if you do, don't start posting about how "the players get frustrated" or "the GM gets angry" (in the various forms we've seen in this discussion) in your game. Those are two different things. In one case, the game is great and everyone's enjoying it. In the other, something's wrong.</blockquote>\nAbsolutely right.  But trying to figure out where the problem lies is not well served by erroneously writing off such such problems inherent to "illusionism".  I certainly agree that a lot of what WarriorMonk describes is dysfunctional, but that is not because it is illusionism, but because, IMO, it is, at best, bad illusionism. WM describes a GM that feels entitles to mock and humiliate the players; that's just plain bad manners, regardless of the medium.<br/><br/>Similarly, super-NPC's that are suddenly allowed to violate established rules, or the "miracles preserving the statu quo" are simply ridiculous under any social contract.  A much better approach is more akin to what was probably intended by the "network of railroads"; that is allowing for some fuzziness, some uncertainty, and building in some "error trapping" that can cope with the players going in unexpected directions.  It is, IME, not very effective to plan for a scene A that leads to a scene B that leads to a scene C, but it an be quite effective to plan for a scene A that passes through an indeterminate patch B to a scene C.<br/><br/>My beef is, as soon as you look at a dysfunctional game and immediately denounce the problems being experienced as inherent to illusionism, you cease to look for solutions, for techniques that work.  Which has the follow-on effect that when someone does post a thread like this, there is little or no advice to give, because the question of how to do it right has been effectively ignored.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436066/#Comment_436066" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-30T12:28:13+00:00" title="July 30, 2014 12:28PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            /nods in agreement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436069/#Comment_436069" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-30T12:42:12+00:00" title="July 30, 2014 12:42PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I kinda knew this thread would devolve into a debate about "illusionist playing" but I was really hoping it would stick to the actual request: how to salvage something from this game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436071/#Comment_436071" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-30T12:49:37+00:00" title="July 30, 2014 12:49PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 30, 2014 1:12PM by AsIf.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hear ya <a href="/forums/profile/Scrape">@Scrape</a>.

These can be all actual valid techniques for a game. Yes, even Railroading, as Nikolai's example proved it possible.<br/><br/>Lying about the nature of the game, cock-blocking and taking away agency from the players without a previous agreement on what conditions could trigger this (a.k.a. a consistant rationale) will generate dysfunctional play as my APs show and as others have experienced.<br/><br/>So, first thing I'm salvaging from here, and proposing as a technique:<br/><br/><b>The Choo-Choo signal</b> talk with players about this technique and the corresponding signal before play. While in play, whenever you as a GM have a need to force agency over player's decisions in order to preserve the status quo of the fiction, so you can present later an specific aesthetic experience to the players (a.k.a. Illusionism), but you can't do it without provoking an interruption of the game flow and a subsequent argument about agency and adjudication (a.k.a. Dysfunctional Railroading), make them a hand signal (pulling the cord of an imaginary train whistle) so the players get informed that you're about to take agency from them for a moment to frame a scene or introduce a twist for aesthetic reasons, a change of pace, or any other reason. The number of times the GM can do this on a session should be discussed with the players beforehand.<br/><br/>I've got an idea for another two to complement this and maybe there can be simpler versions of the same, but I'm at work right now and don't have enough time, I'll get back to you later                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436075/#Comment_436075" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-30T14:19:49+00:00" title="July 30, 2014  2:19PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, I agree with the call to get back to the original function of this thread. <br/><br/>One last comment:\n<blockquote>You can totally railroad me for orientation or exposition if your campaign requires it.

What you're describing is someone taking the reins of the game and pushing it in a particular direction. That's good, and, as you say, it happens at every level of any game. Depending on grainsize and all that. If no one did that at all, the game wouldn't go anywhere.<br/><br/>Where it becomes railroading, as I was trying to explain before (and I'm well aware that this might be just my personal take on it), is when you do it *against the desires of another player*. I try to lead you from Scene A through indeterminate middle ground into Scene C... but halfway through, you say, "Wait! Actually, my character no longer desires to find the Lost Idol. He's in love with Princess Buttercup and he's going to show her how much he cares by abandoning his quest!" <br/><br/>Now, if I start doing whatever sort of manipulation (outside the scope of my agreed-upon tools for the game being played), that's when it becomes railroading. I'm holding my future plan (for Scene C) as more important than your desire to play the game a different way.<br/><br/>This is not good in any kind of human relationship; it's selfish and harmful (or at least dangerous). I don't see how playing an RPG makes it OK. <br/><br/>I think we're on the same page here, but I wanted to clarify. It's a personal, social behaviour I find dysfunctional - not an artistic preference or a matter of favoured techniques.<br/><br/>It's relevant here because WarriorMonk seems to feel this way about his group/game (and his writeup strongly hints that the other players do too).<br/><br/>So that's the last I'll say about that.<br/><br/>WarriorMonk, how prevalent would you say this frustration/social in-fighting is in this group? Is it rare and light, or is it an ongoing issue? <br/><br/>Do the players ever complain about it, or wish that it would "go better next time"? When they start a new game, do they make efforts to change this playstyle?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436076/#Comment_436076" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-30T14:26:28+00:00" title="July 30, 2014  2:26PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, have you seen Old School Hack? (Or any other game with a similar mechanic...)<br/><br/>It has a codified "Choo-choo signal". The GM can "feed the bowl", adding tokens for the players to use to cheer each other on, level up, and defeat their opposition, whenever she wants to take control of events or abuse her powers to make things worse for the players.<br/><br/>In my experience, it works pretty well (although I'm sure it's possible to engage with this mechanic in a dysfunctional way, too - one still has to be socially aware, after all). <br/><br/>I think the way it ties into character success and experience/leveling up makes it stronger, too. Every time the GM does it, the players know they now have access to more resources and experience.<br/><br/>That said, it does create a bit of a feeling of overly-adaptable adversity, like playing a video game against an AI which is allowed to cheat when it's losing. But it's a minor sense of this, mostly because it's overt - the GM has to declare her use of the tokens, so there's no need to argue about it later or to try to obfuscate the behaviour.<br/><br/>What's nice about this mechanic (and/or the choo-choo signal) is that it creates an opportunity for discussion of these techniques for the group. In a hypothetical trad game campaign, there's often a social taboo against calling out the GM for railroading. Here, it's easy to say, "Oh, dang. Well, ok. But how about you throw in three tokens for this nasty revelation we had no way of preparing for?"<br/><br/>Having the permission to say this out loud transforms the environment at the table in a significant way.<br/><br/>I wonder how your group would react to this kind of tool.

Are there lessons that can be learned?  Sure, I think so.  Are there things that can be done to make this actual game work better?  I don't know about that.<br/><br/>One thing I think GM's working in this style could certainly benefit from is the realisation that players fundamentally don't care about your NPC's, and never will.  There is nothing you can do about it, nothing you can give them, no social position to which you can elevate them, that will change this.  The characters in whom players have their primary interest are those played by the other players.  Therefore NPC's need to be used with a fairly light touch, and stay in essentially secondary roles.  This doesn't mean that you can't have NPC's who are physically or socially powerful, but it does mean that you need to realise that the players will never regard them as truly important.<br/><br/>Therefore you need to give the players things for their characters to talk about.  If you can put two player characters on the opposite side of a question, they will hash the matter out between themselves, decide what to do collectively, and act on it, and all this will be far, far more effective than having any NPC trying to tell them what the must or should do.  You can even load up the issue so that one side of it has a much stronger argument than the other, but it's far better to coopt the players into choosing to go where you want them to than to try to force, nag, or badger them.<br/><br/>Asa a general rule, the more time players spend talking to each other, and the less to you through the medium of NPC's, the better.  However, a lot of this probably has to be set up at character creation, which is why it's not particularly useful as a fix for games that are already under way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436080/#Comment_436080" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-30T15:44:49+00:00" title="July 30, 2014  3:44PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/contracycle">@contracycle</a> , seen from that way it can be reduced to adjudication rights.

After all, that selfish primma donna still has a right to be heard and should be given a chance to apply their pont of view to the fiction. <br/><br/>But here we're talking about a narrative style where the GM does careful prep to give the players a chain of experiences through a "shared" fictional space as a medium. Along this narration, there are moments where an actual game takes place, and that's where the character choices matter, even if they won't affect the outcome of the whole narration. Exposed like this, while not an experience made for everyone to enjoy, it's still a valid form of entertaining, as long as measures are taken to avoid to become dysfunctional.<br/><br/>Of course, I talking about a way of GMing that doesn't include cheating the players into believing that this is a sandbox and that they will have full agency at all times.

I'd still have to talk those GMs to make them understand that they are doing dysfunctional railroading because they haven't been open about their narrative style and about which parts of the whole session are really an interactive game and which are just narration. Most probably they can still diferentiate them because of how they learned to GM and some other personal issues (one of these GMs has a small degree of asperger that seems to affect his social sensitivity, therefore making him ignore social cues that indicate when some player or another isn't having fun but doesn't want to ruin the fun of the rest of the group. Maybe it would be enough if these groups just applied the technique, so the GM can learn when he's being obvious or rude in his railroading, in a way that frustrates the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_436081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436081/#Comment_436081" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-30T16:50:03+00:00" title="July 30, 2014  4:50PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/contracycle">@contracycle</a> , seen from that way it can be reduced to adjudication rights.

That the house has two stories, that the river runs north to south, that it is night time.  It doesn't automaticaly follow that authority of what changes can be made to that space must be evenly distributed.  It's perfectly suitable for some types of play, but in this case we are talking about a notional game in which everyone involved has agreed to grant much wider authority to one player for specific reasons: so that a form of consistency can be maintained, so that thematic elements can be brought into play, so that the whole is more constructed than improvised.  This may not be to everyone's taste, but it's not automatically a bad or inferior decision.<br/><br/>In that context, having your central author dice off to see if they are even allowed to bring that coordination to bear is wholly self-defeating.  If the point of doing this is so that, say, this central author can foreshadow the events of session 5 in things that appear in session 2, or whatever, it would be completely counterproductive to subordinate either the foreshadowing or the subsequent events to a die-roll; if the GM loses either one the whole effect would be lost.  Rolling d6 to see if Chekhov's gun is really on the wall is competely useless.<br/><br/>So while yes, it is a matter of adjudication rights, the difference is that those rights were appportioned at the level of the social contract, and are not up for renegotiation at the point of decision in play.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Paul's example isn't really as clear cut as it may appear.  Mainly, I am not sure what it is that Paul wants - does he want to redirect the game to his pursuit of Buttercup?  Or, does he want to play the part of a character who would rather be romancing Buttercup than tramping through swamps in search of lost idols?  That possibly comes off as more cynical than I mean it be; the distinction I'm making is between the point of play and character portrayal.<br/><br/>If Paul really wants to redirect play that way, there isn't much that can be done to solve the problem; agreeing to his demand would also be to trample on the legitimate desires and expectations of everyone else at the table, and at that point we're probably better off parting company (assuming, of course, actual clarity and consent existed previously).  If what Paul wants is to portray a characater who feels that way about Buttercup, but is willing to work with the rest of the group, then this is very easy to accomodate.  In fact, I probably wouldn't have to intervene at all, because the other players, as per my previous post about PC-on-PC persuasion, will probably do the job without me.  And the third option is, that with sufficient notice and lead time, I can probably build Paul's courting of Buttercup into the plot proper.<br/><br/>There are thus potentially solutions to the apparent problem if we are all on the same wavelength.  But if that's not the case, and Paul genuinely feels it is important to his self-expression that he should be able to able to make such a radical change, then everyone would probably be better off if he were playing a style game that better catered to his preferences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436082/#Comment_436082" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-30T17:56:27+00:00" title="July 30, 2014  5:56PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have much to add that I haven't already said, but let me clarify that railroading can come from any party.

But WM, thank you for your more detailed, specific outline like 50 posts ago. Here's what I would focus in on, all the while emphasizing that this is in response to your perception (more on why this is important below):<br/><br/>The game worked for everyone (including you) when you were doing Vampire-y type things, so I would say that the technique there was "hand-wave things to increase epicness."<br/><br/>When he "took off the gloves" (an interesting perception, more below), he put the game into an area where you felt limited, turn-by-turn D&amp;D3.* combat.  With these new limitations you saw the seams more clearly in how much agency you were able to pretend you had. <br/><br/>I'm not going to go into more about what happened after that, I still don't feel like there's enough specifics to reach conclusions.<br/><br/>But even strictly operating from inside your perception, the clear lesson to take away and internalize is not anything about power or illusion or whatever, it's that <i>combat is different</i> in games like D&amp;D3.*.  The degree of arbitrariness you might accept in a portrayal of a social situation is greater than the degree of arbitrariness you might accept in the other situation, perhaps because the rules are more thorough or detailed. Or perhaps because the stakes are different/less flexible? (Running away in D&amp;D3.* is highly disincentivized, so I actually am not really surprised your cohorts wouldn't accept it as an option - I suspect they weren't crtitiquing its dramatic importance but instead its strategic viability.)<br/><br/>Now, stepping outside your perception for a moment, I'm primarily struck that from the GM's perspective, he almost certainly sees his adjustment of the demon encounter on the fly to be exactly the same thing that he did with respect to the pre-demon stuff that you quite liked. This is why I think all our normal muttering about illusionism and participationism and lying to our friends is off base in analyzing your case.  I think your issue is much more specific than that. Here's some options:<br/><br/>* Combat can't be adjusted as much because it's on a much more rigid structure in D&amp;D3.* than other activities. So you and this group could continue to play together, and play together the same way, so long as you kept to systems that had less rigid structures than D&amp;D3 combat (this is not that hard.)<br/><br/>* Or maybe combat can't be adjusted that much because death is on the table.  So you and this group could continue to play together if everyone was scrupulous about rules and outcomes and could agree on what the rules meant.  Or alternately you could play together with a common understanding that death isn't on the table.<br/><br/>Like, I would really drill down to what made the D&amp;D3 combat handwaving and adjustments different from the pre-combat handwaving and adjustments - why were those bad and the previous ones okay? That's the principle I would take away if I were in your shoes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436089/#Comment_436089" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-30T20:43:58+00:00" title="July 30, 2014  8:43PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>One thing I think GM's working in this style could certainly benefit from is the realisation that players fundamentally don't care about your NPC's, and never will.

You can't create a character and expect every player to feel something about him <i>without showing how this character has something they can relate to</i>. Actual play example that happened by accident: On a campaign, another GM introduced the father of one of the PCs as a incredibly powerful giant martial artist, who had a reputation for having kids everywhere in the setting. The PC was just one of many. The GM railroaded us into a fight against him and used all kind of GM fiat and tricks to get him single-handed defeat the whole group. Right after that he throws in a villain NPC who almost outright killed the giant to show us some bad-assery and to make us fear this NPC. The NPC was left barely alive to speak his last words. Typical lazy GM move (well, it could have been done better at least).<br/><br/>But then it backfired in the most amazing way. We got obsessed on saving the giant, forcing our abilities into a whole scene to apply a sort of magical cpr and stabilize the NPC. The GM stated that (after a few very good rolls on our side) the guy was doomed anyway. So we brought him with us and more or less forced a sidequest to heal him. It wasn't about we trying to derrail the plot, it was about trying to save someone because he was a giantic S.O.B. more psychotic than most of the party, that deserved a better death than that.<br/><br/>Well, this example was accidental, but because of this and some other similar experiences we saw that it could be induced by a good GM in the same way a good writer makes you love or hate their characters. Here is some of the clues we got to it:<br/><br/>-Never try to make the players to like a character that can't or won't do nothing for them. It has to have some skill that they could use on their next adventures and that it will use gladly to help them.<br/>-Give it to them, let them do whatever they want from it. If you gave it a good skill they will put it into use straight away. Make sure it works and/or is better than any of the PCs at that, or they will toss it away.<br/>-Make it singular. Not special, nor perfect, not better than them. Give it an accent, a particular look, a way of walking with a limp, whatever that makes it different from the rest.<br/>-NEVER ever make it annoying in any way. If you want to make it dumb, make it obedient. If you want to make it a bastard, make it loyal. And above all, no matter what defect you dare to put on it, make it useful <span style="text-decoration: underline;">when it counts</span>.<br/>-Never give it power over the party, nor spotlight unless it's the party's last hope. The show is not about this NPC.<br/>-Instead of opposing the party, let it learn from them. If they go psychotic, it will learn to go psychotic too. If they are good, it will try to imitate them too. It's the cute part of having a "kid", they will soon see it like their kid because of this.<br/>-What if you want them to respect it? Never make it legal good stupid. Take note of who your party looks up to. It can still be a paladin, but make it a badass one. Give them respect through this character and they will respect it. Put it on their side when everyone else is against them, and they will respect it more.<br/><br/>If you're railroading, all this is a setup for an oncoming scene. The character can turn out to be someone important, or gain it by it's own effort. It can be taken prisioner, try to make something risky or go beyond his usual effort to do something for the group. You can get it killed or betray the party. All these are guaranteed to make the party react in some way, once they have accustomed to the presence of the NPC and trust it.<br/><br/>Another example: our Pathfinder GM created a paladin based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkysjcs5vFU" rel="nofollow">Dio's Holy Diver</a> a total badass machine of punishing evil. Forged us some good weapons without much cost since we were trying to vanquish some evil too. Later he went head on to kill the BBG once he revealed, even when it was too much for him. We could see the light of his smite evil from miles away while we were desperately trying to get there to help him. It appeared again, and again, and again, and each time less brighter... That definitely made us run faster. We made it barely in time, and even had to punch him to make him leave the fight to us. That was one hell of a paladin that we got to respect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436091/#Comment_436091" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-30T22:25:57+00:00" title="July 30, 2014 10:25PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>The shared imagined space is shared of necessity so that all the participants are conscious of the same environment.

Rolling d6 to see if Chekhov's gun is really on the wall is competely useless.<br/><br/>So while yes, it is a matter of adjudication rights, the difference is that those rights were appportioned at the level of the social contract, and are not up for renegotiation at the point of decision in play.<br/></blockquote>\nGranted, this is Railroading. But rolling the dice for adjudication was a propossal I made just for the explicit case when the GM has broken the illusion through poor railroading, has used rule zero to take away players choice, it's obvious for everyone that the GM hasn't prep that much in advance and that the quality of the prep is sub-standard to the point that derrailing is more interesting (which shouldn't be at all, so put yourself in that place and tell me how bad this GM is now) and the situation has already gone out of control. Consider that an unusual case? Well, It has happened to me twice and I have read about too many people with similar experiences. Actually, I think it happened so much that lots of indie games were inspired by all this frustration.<br/><br/>So, if I'd still like to play with this poor excuse of a GM knowing that when he starts blocking us the choice is half an hour arguments that go nowhere or walk away to play another game, I gladly say "GM, roll the dice" before trying the other two options. It has worked for another group I played in.<br/><br/>Now, about the shared space, though it may depend on the players and GMs, I've noted a clear tendency of the mentioned GMs to overprotect their NPCs. Unusually high stats, tons of prepared tricks and traps in places that couldn't be considered their lair and made no sense, abusing the rules to make them untouchable. I recall a frustrating battle where we managed to make a boss run away. The GM didn't gave us any xp under the excuse that we hadn't defeated, as in "reduce his hp to zero". On another one we faced a rogue who was using a woundrous item to make itself invisible on top of his unbeatable ranks of hiding and move silently. Though we had managed to get dust of Appearance, another wondrous item, the GM ruled it had no effect because the description didn't said which item defeated which. Nope, he didn't even rolled the dice to see if we had a chance with it, made us waste a resource and it was a final battle, so it wasn't like he was saving that character for making an important scene later. How did we defeated it? well, after four hours of frustrating no-combat, the NPC was just mocking and toying with us. I tried a desperate move that didn't work and in response the NPC tried something and rolled a 1. After confirming it, the GM ruled that it had hit his face against my fist by accident and got stunned. I pinned it, the rest of the party came and we killed it. Frustrating, anticlimatic and boring. And it wasn't the  final boss yet.<br/><br/>Well, my point was: if it's a shared space, why won't the GM share, just because he wants to railroad? Well, because in this case, he's a poor railroader. He could have done dozens of more interesting things than just make an NPC good at a single thing by adding bonuses until there wasn't any chance to find it even with all the situational bonuses we could get. Geez, even when me and my group see a bad movie, we have the chance to mock it until we laugh about it, before we walk out of it. But this GM just inflated a character to laugh at us, not to tell a good story. He made a shared space and took it away from us. We didn't even had the option of losing or running, and some times, not even of dying.<br/><br/>Ok, so I've got plenty of bad stories about these couple of GMs. As I've called them before, these were their mistakes. They have good things, but system mastery isn't one of them, nor good railroading. Only one can do decent narration but hasn't good social sensitivity to recalibrate his game on the go. The other is still using an old campaign from memory instead of making prep and can't even narrate it as it was meant to be. And he seems to be so overprotective of it that it reaches the point where there's no way to know what your character is supposed to to except to fall prey of the GM tricks so he can have fun at our expenses.<br/><br/>Does anyone can see good things yet? It seems like every time I try to salvage something someone here cuts me to defend railroading, say it's not for me or that the game isn't my thing. Stop it. I have already stated I'm okay with good, honest railroading (more than okay, actually I respect it more than you think) I'm up for good illusionism anyday (and I've even GMd using it a lot), I've both tried and enjoyed a lot of other games and then went back to these ones (with different GMs of course) and had a blast. These guys I'm talking about suck at GM? Yeah, I know, that's why I don't play with them anymore. What do they do that still makes other people go?<br/><br/>-Meta-intrigue. After a few sessions players are seeking revenge from them. They let'em try. I hope they could be honest about it, it would be a different game but at least then I'd know what we are really playing. It would be better yet if it were an "honest to the rules" duel of witts.<br/><br/>-This one I forgot: They are there. No one else of our circle GMs 3.5 D&amp;D anymore, nor Vampire. We're still fans of both games, but nobody else from us wants to run the games.<br/><br/>-One of the GMs makes interesting settings. It's a pity that he puts sooo many high difficulty rolls blocking the navegation through it and some situations trigger only with way too specific requirements that the players have no way to know.<br/><br/>-Yesterday another player told me he went there to try and test builds (he said "characters" but after further questioning I found out he meant "builds") but yet was frustrated that the Vampire GM always ended up killing his bulds before he managed to test them at full strenght, because he has antecedents of making setting-breaking builds. The D&amp;D GM allows him to use any manual and revives his character when he dies. That bores him to no avail, but at least he gets to try his builds.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436092/#Comment_436092" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-30T22:45:13+00:00" title="July 30, 2014 10:45PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 30, 2014 10:56PM by AsIf.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a> - Am I one of the people you think is cutting you down to defend railroading?  I thought I had made serious progress toward some answers to your question.  I'm talking about constructive uses of railroading techniques.  Am I answering a different question than you asked?<br/><br/>As for your examples above, sounds like typical high-Ego GMs who have close relations with various types of power tripping.  I would guess they're relatively young, but that's not necessarily true.  Let's face it: Every artform has people who are bad at it, but think they're good at it.  Sounds like you've met some.  The problem with these people may simply be that they don't have enough talent to tell that they don't have enough talent.<br/><br/>But the players may be gaining different sorts of payoffs out of the game.  Hell, even "taunt the asshole" might be a game strategy that's fun for some people.  Irony.  Satire.  Disaffection.  Trolling.  Ball-busting.  Macho Posturing.  FT(game)W but it's an excuse to hang out and have some brews.  Enjoying the game ironically, or enjoying crazy reconstructions of the rules more than playing them straight.  <br/><br/>I guess the point I'm making here is that the "social contract" or the "goal" of the game might not be the same for all participants.  It's very possible to have five people playing, all for totally different sorts of payoffs.  In this case I suspect the players have one payoff, and the GM has another, and there's a metagame going on for who gets their payoff.  And they seem to enjoy it, in (what most of us would probably call) a depraved sort of way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436093/#Comment_436093" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-31T00:13:33+00:00" title="July 31, 2014 12:13AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Gareth, d'you notice how people on the web <i>continually</i> use "Participationism" to mean "Illusionism with consent"?

Seems like WM's old groups are in between?<br/></blockquote>\nLooks like what rests between those points is a sort of "I want revenge on the GM, let the duel of wits begin!"  That seems to be the motivation of the group that still plays with them, as they keep complaining to us about the game, but keep returning.</blockquote>\nHuh.  If I feel I'm engaged in a fair duel against a hated opponent, I'm not going to complain about that fact to others.  I guess I might share how much I hate my opponent and want to beat him... but you said "complain about the game", not "rail against the opponent".  It's still not clear to me whether the players are returning because of a solid motivation they can actually pursue, or whether they're all crazy to persist.<br/><br/>I mention this only in case it helps us pin down what actually is and isn't dysfunctional in this scenario.  For example, I'm not sure how much we can infer about fun "beat the GM" play from frustrated "can't get our illusion and hate the GM for that, so might as well grief him" play.  I may start wandering a bit from your account into idle speculation land.  Hopefully you can find the overlap of musings and reality...  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote><blockquote>3) Battle of wits -- the players and GM jockey for advantage in the game, as adjudicated (at least in part) by something other than "just the GM" or "just the players"<br/>. . . <br/>What could possibly make the GM stop asserting his will on the proceedings and say "okay you win this one"?<br/>. . . <br/>The only answer I've encountered looks like . . . "honor clever rules-use above all else"</blockquote>\nThese guys have a consistent rationale of sorts. The first rule applied is the one the GM remembers. If players remember it differently, or it's applied in a situation to deny them of an option to solve a problem (most probably an option never foreseen by the GM) they argue using common sense.</blockquote>\nGotcha.  Well, I think you and I already know the "common sense" game, and have mined it for techniques in more functional play.  I'm inclined to move on, but there is an interesting note here about positioning:<br/><br/>If (a) the GM is in fact bound by fiction-based common sense, and if (b) the GM is looking to block players from improving their fictional position, and if (c) the players manage to modify the fiction, unblocked, in such a way that, when looked at through fiction-based common sense, <i>does</i> constitute improved position, then:<br/><br/>Cool.  The players just beat the GM.<br/><br/>But that's a lot of "if"s.  And I've never seen it happen often enough to be fun.  And I've seen the mere possibility of that cause all sorts of attempts which get blocked, which also tends to be no fun.  And it's easy to argue endlessly about "common sense", so this system isn't sufficient by itself.  And the GM usually has the power to block anything, which means player success is really just GM oversight, and thus the GM's remedy is constant vigilance, which is <i>also</i> no fun.<br/><br/>So perhaps that's what'd need to be fixed to make this fun -- make these fiction-based player-GM challenges:<br/>- frequent contests<br/>- only happen when there is in fact a contest to be had<br/>- adjudicated by rules or principles beyond just common sense<br/>- with a GM with limits on their power<br/><br/>I could write a board game that plays out that way, but I'm not sure how to achieve that in an RPG where the fiction still makes things happen.  One useful example might be Power Play.  I've yet to play it, but it sounds promising based on the <a href="http://level99store.lvl99games.com/NarrativeGames?product_id=59" rel="nofollow">order page</a>, the <a href="http://www.lvl99games.com/?page_id=2188" rel="nofollow">about page</a>, and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9vJ432SDMo" rel="nofollow">conversation I had with the designers</a>.\n<blockquote>If that doesn't convince the GM or the players, they go to the book. If the rule clearly states something favoring either one, the game goes on and the GM tries another approach.</blockquote>Hmm.  That sounds close to my experience with "honor clever rules-use above all else", except...\n<blockquote>Finding loopholes, power gaming and carefully making questions and stating actions and reactions is rewarded with spotlight. The GM tends to build over it to prepare a counterattack for the players, turning it against them.</blockquote>...without the promise that players will <i>gain advantage</i> from nailing a rule.  Instead, they get something that's fun in a different way: <i>attention</i>, and then <i>more</i> attention to the situation they introduced into the fiction.  Definitely an effective reward, though perhaps not the one the players were consciously seeking.<br/><br/>Maybe this is why they're pissed but keep playing?  They strive for fictional effectiveness, but can't resist the intermittent payouts of attention?<br/><br/>As far as making this functional, I think the key would be a rulebook that's beyond easy GM mastery.  Probably lots of dependent special case rules, like many card games have.  Here's a model: you play Magic the Gathering against the GM, and only when you do a point of damage do you get to roleplay and get taken seriously.  For every action that <i>doesn't</i> damage the GM, the GM does whatever they want to your characters.<br/><br/>Obviously MtG itself is too separate and attention-demanding to coexist with an RPG-style running narrative, but hopefully the idea makes sense...\n<blockquote>But again, taking the dysfunctional play out of it, we could be playing a collaborative honorful duel of wits, using additional dice rolls/flip a coin to adjudicate instead of interrupting the game to check the book. Anyone could check the book out of his turn and keep things prepared to justify their actions and possible outcome in front of the GM. The GM could made a similar thing when doing his prep.</blockquote>\nI think die rolls and coin flips might ruin it -- you might not get enough bang for your wits.  As for minimizing interruption, I'm with you, but that's because I hate this sort of rules-gotcha play to begin with.  If I <i>liked</i> it, then I'd probably <i>enjoy</i> flipping open the relevant rule for all to see.  Actually, we could probably have the best of both worlds by putting the rules on cards rather than in a book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436099/#Comment_436099" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-31T06:25:05+00:00" title="July 31, 2014  6:25AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 31, 2014 6:26AM by Paul_T.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lots of interesting observations here.<br/><br/>I think both JD and David_Berg are onto something in the sense that, yes, there are expectations created by the style of play the GM is going for and the rules in use at the table.<br/><br/>I'm not sure that changing to a different ruleset would fix the *social* problems here, but there are two solutions being which are worth at least thinking about:<br/><br/>* JD points out that switching to a looser set of rules can allow the railroading/GM guidance (whatever we want to call it) to be more seamless, easier to handle. Some games are nicely set for Illusionist practices, with freeform roleplaying being a good example - D&amp;D 3 certainly *is* rigid enough that obvious and clumsy manipulations are necessary to force certain outcomes into play, which, combined with player investment in character builds, is bound to create some friction.<br/><br/>So, a looser system with more room for the GM to adjudicate outcomes might make the railroading easier, more seamless, and reduce some of the social friction we're seeing here.<br/><br/>* Dave seems to be suggesting the opposite approach: if you enjoy this battle of wits, then make it more explicit. Pick a ruleset and stick with it: something which is robust enough that the players and the GM can really compete with each other, so that there are clearer lines for victory and defeat.<br/><br/>I could see accomplishing this in D&amp;D3 by modifying your social contract to include the rules being more front-and-center. For example, when an NPC or monster appears and certain rolls are made, the GM reveals AC numbers, skill totals, or other stats, and the players take note of these. So, part of the process of discovery for the players is learning the statistics of their opposition. Then everyone commits to sticking to these, and rolls all dice in the open - in other words, in a future encounter the players can reference the stats they already know to argue the case for an attack landing when the GM might be tempted to fudge and say it didn't.<br/><br/>This gives the players something objective to pin their attempts to: they know the "target", and can pin it down, so that they can work out a plan, and have a sense of whether it's going to work or not. The GM is forced to show his hand a little more in this style of play, so that the players can have a legitimate attempt at success or failure, and a sense of their chances.<br/><br/>Once this is recognized as the social contract at work, the group might get used to treating fictional positioning the same way: the GM makes a determination, the players discover it little by little, and everyone sticks their guns to see how the thing actually plays out.<br/><br/>As an aside (it may be irrelevant), I've had experiences playing with groups like the one described: perhaps a great group of people, or they were fun RPG players, but the GMing was a little stilted for my tastes, something felt dysfunctional. In those groups, over time I'd only play in one-shots (which tended to be put together with more care, on one hand, and less attachment to outcomes and character, on the other hand) or if I was GMing (which everyone enjoyed), and bow out of the "regular" campaigns which I didn't enjoy as much.<br/><br/>Also, WarriorMonk, I agree with your thoughts on NPCs. Of course players can and do often care a great deal about NPCs, just like characters in a book or a TV show! But, as you point out, that's not something the GM can *force* on them. The players decide whether they care or not, and how much. They might decide that your honourable paladin is actually an arrogant asshole; the GM can't control *how much* they care, or how they see the character.<br/><br/>I think the best GMing happens when the GM *recognizes* how the players feel about the character and reacts to it to build better scenes or more drama, by exaggerrating or challenging their feelings for the NPC. A GM who *assumes* the players will feel a certain way about his or her NPC and then tries to force them to react a certain way when they don't isn't exactly stellar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436102/#Comment_436102" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-31T07:43:51+00:00" title="July 31, 2014  7:43AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a> - Am I one of the people you think is cutting you down to defend railroading?

The point I was attempting to make is that NPC's can't really be using as lynchpins for plot.  If you plan for a plot that is based on the players encountering an NPC and reacting to them in a specific way, a way which is necessary for the furtherance of your plot, you're very likely to be disapointed.  The players are just as likely to be emotionally attached to a horse as they are to your damsel in distress, because NPC's have little or no more substance to them than any other element of the setting that you might describe.  They aren't going to work like non-viewpoint characters in linea media do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_436119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436119/#Comment_436119" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-31T15:07:08+00:00" title="July 31, 2014  3:07PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Well, my point was: if it's a shared space, why won't the GM share, just because he wants to railroad?</blockquote>\nBecause "railroading" will make for a better game.  In principle, if you're doing it right, if you have the social contract consent, if it's the kind of game the group likes to play.<br/><br/>I'm not making excuses for what I regard as the bad practices that you are describing.\n<blockquote>Does anyone can see good things yet? It seems like every time I try to salvage something someone here cuts me to defend railroading, say it's not for me or that the game isn't my thing. Stop it. I have already stated I'm okay with good, honest railroading (more than okay, actually I respect it more than you think) I'm up for good illusionism anyday (and I've even GMd using it a lot), I've both tried and enjoyed a lot of other games and then went back to these ones (with different GMs of course) and had a blast. These guys I'm talking about suck at GM? Yeah, I know, that's why I don't play with them anymore. What do they do that still makes other people go?</blockquote>\nWell, perhaps this is just a case of not being clear on what you meant by "salvaging" something from these games.  I took that question to mean, what can I understand about why people try to play in this way?  On that basis, making the point that "railroading", done right, isn't going to be as negative as you experienced it, is something that could be taken away.<br/><br/>If you're asking, why do people keep playing with such an abusive GM, that I couldn't really say.

Maybe we should all just agree on those as the new definitions.  No one still reads the Forge glossary anyway, and that'd stop the need for corrections.  The "with/without consent" distinction strikes me as more pivotal and worthy of different terms than the "tacit/explicit consent" distinction.</blockquote>\nIt seems like a backward step to me.  Not least because then Participationism would have to be redefined, and that redefinition accepted: because as it stands, it still carries the connotation of the players being passive observers of something wholly enacted by the GM.  So we have a faulty dichotomy between the use of GM force, which is Always Bad (spit), except for the case where the players willingly surrender any kind of agency at all.  And seeing as the latter isn't really attractive - as mentioned, it was posited as a possibility, not something actually observed - you end with a pair of definitions that label "both" types of Exploration-centric play as bad.<br/><br/>What's entirely missing, then, is any recognition of a style of play in which the GM uses force specifically to give the players what they want.  The "consent" issue overshadows the that of artifice, and makes it sound like something that you reluctantly agree to, as if you have to lie back and think of England, rather than something that you might engage with enthusiastically because it produces good games.<br/><br/>The virtue of the glossary, both then and now, is that it serves as an external reference point to keep everyone talking about the same thing.  What would that new reference point be, if I accepted that the definitions should be shifted?  All that would happen, I expect, is that you and I will use the terms idiosyncratically, and everyone who has already been getting their jollies from ostentatiously declaring some forms of play to be morally and ethically inferior to their own will continue to use them in that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19624/trying-to-rescue-something-from-a-dysfunctional-gming-style" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19624/trying-to-rescue-something-from-a-dysfunctional-gming-style" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19624/trying-to-rescue-something-from-a-dysfunctional-gming-style/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19624/trying-to-rescue-something-from-a-dysfunctional-gming-style/p3" rel="next">3</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19624/trying-to-rescue-something-from-a-dysfunctional-gming-style/p3" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F19624%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F19624%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Trying to rescue something from a dysfunctional GMing style - Page 3 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19624/trying-to-rescue-something-from-a-dysfunctional-gming-style/p3" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Trying to rescue something from a dysfunctional GMing style - Page 3" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19624/trying-to-rescue-something-from-a-dysfunctional-gming-style/p3" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="I'm always again gobsmacked by the categorical &quot;all-or-nothing&quot; mentality of these conversations.

It sounds to me like the disconnect is in our definition of the term (after all, according to you, it happens to some degree in ALL roleplaying, right? Whereas, by my definition, it's something I haven't seen in a game for, quite possibly, several years, and would make me want to leave that game, but occurs regularly in some styles of play).<br/><br/>That said, it would be pretty interesting to list and/or discuss positive uses of railroading. We've had discussions about this before, but I don't ever remember listing Actual Play examples. The criteria would be:<br/><br/>Tell us about a time when 1) you were a player in a game, 2) <i>the GM (or whoever) railroaded the game in some way you weren't aware of OR did not consent to</i>, 3) you found out about it later, and 4) you see it as a positive experience which enriched the game.<br/><br/>I'd love to hear these stories - I'm sure there are a few out there, despite my strict criteria.

It's a different kind of ride in the amusement park.  It's like sitting on the train that goes around the park and looking at the tableaus, rather than getting in one of the bumper cars and choosing who to hit.  (Note that riding on a train does not preclude all sorts of interesting interactivity - the conductor might give you a hand-job, for instance.  Tiny little human comedies and dramas show up as "photographs" or "vignettes" and move by.  The scenery outside the window changes.  Ever ride a train?

However I'm thankfull for all the insights and reccomendations about railroading, it's been interesting and quite instructive.<br/><br/>I guess I can resume the technique mentioned into something simpler like:<br/><br/><b>Signal Railroading:</b> Whenever you want to comunicate an aesthetic experience to the rest of the players, use this sign to ask them permission to temporarily relinquish agency rights from them. The sign can be a phrase, a change in your tone, a hand signal or it can be mixed with a game mechanic.<br/><br/>On another note, I had a singular experience yesterday that gave me an insight on why these GMs react like this and where do they learned to do it. We were testing a game in development and we were implementing special abilities for the game. One of the playtesters made an ability that called for us to wing a mechanic on the fly to support it, caught us unprepared and seemed to unbalance the game. It was late, we were all kinda tired and not thinking right. On the morning I realized that it wasn't the mechanic that was unbalanced, but that we had forgotten to play attention to the turn order and how many actions and reactions we were making. The combat seemed unbalanced from to this player's side, but it was because the opposition wasn't taking actions to attack (which had the right to do, mechanics-wise) and was only reacting instead. At first we thought it was his special ability that made the game unbalanced, but later I realized that the player was rushing things in a way that made us lost track of turns.<br/><br/>The thing that relates this experience to the thread theme is that for a moment I had the same feeling the mentioned GMs should have had before (coincidentally, they both play with this playtester I'm talking about). It felt like losing control of the game, like nothing of whatever I could do would change the outcome and that I could just endure it and prepare better for it the next time. As a GM (and illusionist) I've felt this a few times before, the moment when all your work comes crashing down because players made the only thing you didn't thought about. It's hard not to lose control then and try some desperate move to make things the way they were before. I think that on most of those occasions I managed to build on it and move in the dark for a bit until new options appeared. It's a kind of a sensitive moment for a GM, his emotions might get exposed on that moment and I wouldn't be surprised that a bit of mockery applied by the group to the GM on that moment could trigger a dysfunctional railroading episode.<br/><br/>Another reflection I had this morning from that moment is that either as a player of GM we're interested in enjoying certain feelings through the game. I want to feel like I'm a huge axe-wielding half-orc that has nothing to fear from this or that kind of enemy in particular. As a GM I want to feel comfortable in the role of a powerful villain (just enough to make a good performance actually, not to rule the setting) and I want to transmit that to the players. The game mechanics and stat blocks give us a way to defend it, to corroborate that it's an acepted truth infront of others. It's natural that once you find this to be true, you try to minmax to protect those feelings, either as aplayer or as a GM. After all, those feelings are the reason you're playing.You're going through all of this to experience something.<br/><br/>So I talked it with a friend and a couple of minutes ago we came up with a mechanic for our game called "Plot Armor". I'ts basically an instance of the game called by the GM to present a character without fear of having the players kill his feeling inmediatly. For a single turn the GM has the right to be badass, can show off and attack the players without the need of rolling dice, but doesn't do any damage at all nor imposes any statuses on the PCs, except maybe narrative (enemy cuts a thin wound on your cheek, sends you flying but you land on your feet, surprises you with your guard down but stops his fist in front of you, though that doesn't make you flinch a bit, etc.) This way plot armor covers both the NPC and PCs for a single moment to deliver the aesthetic experience the GM wants. After that, combat resumes as usual.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436192/#Comment_436192" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-01T13:29:32+00:00" title="August  1, 2014  1:29PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you heard of the "Death Flag" rules? (I think they first appeared in E6, but they might be much older.)<br/><br/>They could be useful for something like this.<br/><br/>I think you're right about the GMs' and groups' motivations in your description, but fixing those symptoms doesn't address the underlying problem. (That the GM is trying to tell a particular story, while the players believe they are free to choose whatever actions for their characters, and, at the same time, the system being used doesn't support this combination in any clear fashion.)<br/><br/>It's also very possible (and even likely) that the players/group don't want to lose the "illusion" of free play, and obvious mechanical call-outs will "ruin the game experience" for them. In that case, a higher-level fix is required, like all getting together to agree that going along with the GM's plans in the games you play is desirable for everyone, and that everyone can use subtle tools at their disposal (both GM and players) to "keep the game on rails", but without drawing attention to it if possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19624/trying-to-rescue-something-from-a-dysfunctional-gming-style/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19624/trying-to-rescue-something-from-a-dysfunctional-gming-style">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19624/trying-to-rescue-something-from-a-dysfunctional-gming-style/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19624/trying-to-rescue-something-from-a-dysfunctional-gming-style/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F19624%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F19624%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
