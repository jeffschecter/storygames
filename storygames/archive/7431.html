The players, especially, seemed to get a lot out of it in terms of immersion (oh, that word...) It seems to hit some subconscious spots with its dream metaphors and semi-hypnotic techniques (going under, dropping through zones of different colors).<br/><br/>It has its riddles - that is, the game doesn't state outright (IIRC) some important setting elements. Who are the characters? The book actually tells you, but it's not easy to spot. What's going on with the different higher agents? If you look at the organization charts and read the info on the agents, it seems there's something very fishy happening there. <br/><br/>I never figured out The Girl - I don't even know if there is an answer to her in the book. Who or what is she?<br/><br/>It's been said that the book is a Rorschach test for the GM. I find that to be fairly accurate; how you decide to portray Command, how you run missions and describe the landscape, how you run the spider men... all these things will vary from GM to GM, even though each GM will probably feel they're doing it "the right way".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165162/#Comment_165162" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T23:58:20+00:00" title="August 25, 2008 11:58PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lacuna is really a Cold War era spy game.

It helps a bit, but I\u2019m not wholly satisfied.<br/>We did have a fine time playing the game too, and we really enjoyed the heartbeat technique.<br/><br/>But I\u2019m always a bit suspicious about claims about a game/book/movie being deep, having hidden symbols and that everyone should find his own greater meaning with the game, that the GM should focus on the aspects he\u2019d like and there is no way to play it wrong. The same advice goes for D&amp;D, so does this mean that Lacuna simply just employs a lot weird stuff, pretending it have deeper meaning? Hopefully this doesn\u2019t sound too harsh, but I\u2019m just a bit sceptic about the game.<br/><br/>I like games with weird dreamy stuff and surrealism, that\u2019s why I\u2019m a great fan of Nephilim and Whispering Vault and always looking out for new games of this type, like Noumenon (read it, haven\u2019t played it ... yet) and Solipsist (just bought it). Yet for some reason I wasn\u2019t satisfied with Lacuna. <br/><br/>So let\u2019s assume I\u2019m missing something, and please bring me ideas, experiences and good advice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165167/#Comment_165167" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T00:12:10+00:00" title="August 26, 2008 12:12AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way I see it, Jared probably has a certain idea of what the city "really" is. Jesse's cold war spy thing sounds probable, for example. However, it doesn't really matter what he wants it to be; in making the game cryptic, and marketing it like an open-ended riddle thingy, he's opened the setting for everyone to interpret on their own. <br/><br/>I'd like to focus on one thing: The difference between <i>hidden</i> meaning and <i>deep greater</i> meaning. Just because Lacuna has hidden stuff, doesn't make that stuff deep or great. It's just obscure. However, in <i>searching for meaning</i> (pretentiousness alert!) people create meaning - sometimes deep, sometimes great. Just being open to the idea that there's something in here, something to explore, is one of the best things about role-playing (IMO), and it parallels the mystician's vision that if you open yourself to the universe, it will reveal its secrets to you. The game can certainly put you in a state of mind that allows you to discover good things - about your fellow players, about the play experience, about your imagination. And in that respect, whether Jared really wanted this to be an intellectual riddle about the cold war is irrelevant. <br/><br/>(And oh, if you like dreamy surrealism, you should take a look at Itras By! It's the pinnacle of Norwegian design.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Morten%20Greis" title="Morten Greis"><img alt="Morten Greis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Morten%20Greis">Morten Greis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165171/#Comment_165171" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T00:34:04+00:00" title="August 26, 2008 12:34AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I\u2019ve seen the Cold War-metaphor described elsewhere.

The way it's been described on forums as a rorschach test, a riddle; the very obscure title "Lacuna part I. The Creation of the Mystery and the Girl from Blue City (second attempt)". The whole package says "There's something here you don't understand. Perhaps you will never actually understand it. If this is a riddle, it may not be complete."<br/><br/>With all this, players will get curious. They will be more alert and focused, and also more open to spotting weird connections. Seeing a connection is very much the same as creating one: Just having this openness will make players creative. And since the game elements don't always make much sense, connections can get associative and semi-/non-rational, like they are in dreams.<br/><br/>The GM will also be more alert than usual when reading. When I read the book, I knew there was more there than met the eye, and instead of adopting the "oh god, have to read all these <i>rules</i>, hope there's a good experience on the other side" attitude I sometimes have, I was thinking "okay, pay attention to every little word; there may be a clue there - maybe even something nobody else has picked up on!" I was sharper than usual when GMing, more in control.<br/><br/>Now, you could probably do the exact same thing in D&amp;D in theory - but in practice, it's impossible to ignore the expectations we have for a D&amp;D game. Nobody's going to feel like there's an open, unfinished riddle to be found somewhere in the books. Only by presenting something new and unknown, and being coy about it, can you create this experience. It's very easy to do in theory, but very hard in practice.<br/><br/>Wrt anmeldereksemplar: Jeg skal si fra til Ole Peder, som har skrevet spillet!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/olepeder" title="olepeder"><img alt="olepeder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/olepeder">olepeder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165177/#Comment_165177" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T01:35:14+00:00" title="August 26, 2008  1:35AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 26, 2008 1:42AM by olepeder.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Also I\u2019m rather curoius about Itras by, but my local bookpusher (Fantask) doesn\u2019t carry it.

I'm one of the game's co-authors. Itras by can be ordered <a href="https://secure.kolofon.no/index.aspx?pid=2198&amp;docid=91" rel="nofollow">directly from the publisher</a>.<br/><br/>You might also want to check out our homepage, which has press clippings, a wiki, YouTube-trailer, PDF excerpts and more, at <a href="http://www.itrasby.no" rel="nofollow">itrasby.no</a><br/><br/>It'd be a great service to us if you'd like to review the book for the Danish market. Please e-mail me your adress at ole.peder.giaever [] gmail.com, and I'll have the publisher send you a copy.<br/><br/>Furthermore, it'd be very good if you, after having reviewed the item and concluded whether or not it's any good, would like to suggest an order to Fantask. Bookstores get the book at a 25 % discount, they may contact the publisher directly. The game's ISBN # is 9788230004494.<br/><br/>If you mail me, I can also supply you with three scenarios in addition to the one in the book. They were played at the Arcon festival here in Oslo this summer, and received some acclaim. You might want to consider one of them for Fastaval. It's possible that I'll go myself, but it depends a bit on work and such.<br/><br/>Best regards, <br/>Ole Peder Gi\xe6ver                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Morten%20Greis" title="Morten Greis"><img alt="Morten Greis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Morten%20Greis">Morten Greis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165185/#Comment_165185" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T02:06:37+00:00" title="August 26, 2008  2:06AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Ole Peder,<br/><br/><br/>Thank you for kind offer.

Sometimes by pointing out the fact that there is a mystery, or by suggesting some explanations for it, you kill it, and the same is true of "hidden depths", the more you say about them the more they can become uninteresting. <br/><br/>Take the afore-mentioned Nephillim for example, which I also love. It tries so hard to have hidden depths and subtle complexities that it just becomes too complex, and the hidden complexities are not very hidden, because they are forever pointing them out and telling you "look a mystery" and "see here ... this is esoteric and meaningful"! It's still a great setting, but its so overburdened with well signposted mystery that it never compelled me to want to seek answers.<br/><br/>On the other hand if you say nothing at all about your hidden depths than maybe you don't have any? What's the difference between an implicit, but totally unsignposted, hidden depth, and an incomplete game where you just didn't think of something? Note I'm not saying Lacuna is in this category, but I have seen games that were, and then it's just up to the players to shovel in something of mystery without any help from the author at all.<br/><br/>I think it's a fine line                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MountZionRyan" title="MountZionRyan"><img alt="MountZionRyan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/426/nG1TIXTID71FS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MountZionRyan">MountZionRyan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165208/#Comment_165208" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T06:07:21+00:00" title="August 26, 2008  6:07AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Lacuna is an evocative setting with as much or as little underlying meaning as the GM gives it.

It is that lack of heavy-handedness that I love about Lacuna.  If, as a GM, you expect the setting laid out it great detail, Lacuna will seem incomplete.<br/><br/>And although this paucity of specifics may come off as pretension, I believe it is simply a subtle (or not so subtle) way of creating a mysterious setting and forcing the GM to take ownership.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165212/#Comment_165212" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T06:35:53+00:00" title="August 26, 2008  6:35AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MountZionRyan</cite>forcing the GM to take ownership.</blockquote>\nYes, that's it, exactly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165219/#Comment_165219" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T06:57:48+00:00" title="August 26, 2008  6:57AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So my curiosity has been piqued... but is there any way to actually <i>get</i> a copy of the Second Attempt these days?

Lacuna throws around lots of mystery elements but doesn't offer solutions. <br/><br/>In play, you can do the same - throw around lots of surreal mystery things, only hinting at answers - or you can allow yourself to discover a solution. We've done both. I like both.<br/><br/>It is rather pretentious, but I do like it. It can also be rather shallow, in that it's often an <i>appearance</i> of mystery, not a real mystery to be solved, and I like that too.<br/><br/>I actually disagree with most of Jesse's summary, which just goes to show...something.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165268/#Comment_165268" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T09:41:00+00:00" title="August 26, 2008  9:41AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>From<a href="http://memento-mori.livejournal.com/" rel="nofollow">Jared's blog</a>:If you want my other games, TFB as they're sold out and I'm not printing any more (at least not for a bit).</blockquote>That's what I hate about Jared - he's a polite, soft-spoken man but he never speaks his mind or tells you what he really thinks.<br/>I'm kind of surprised Lacuna isn't available in pdf, though.  most of his other games are.  huh.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165284/#Comment_165284" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T10:00:58+00:00" title="August 26, 2008 10:00AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have the "first attempt" in pdf.

The mechanical rules are incomplete. This may be intentional, forcing players (or just the GM) to actively decide how to interpret them, or it could be an oversight. Jared filled in the gap in an earlier story-games thread (ie you can't push a roll when you're at max heart rate), and it seems that people who learn the game playing with him all play it the same way.<br/><br/>2.) There are no procedural rules, except to set up what scenarios are about. How the players and GM interact, what their respective roles and narrative authorities are is entirely up for negotiation, as the rules are silent. I currently play with two different groups of gamers, who roleplay in completely different styles, so I find this quite interesting.<br/><br/>3.) The setting is fairly open-ended. There is a lot of cool material, but no "big secret" is revealed, and the meta-plot is up to the GM (or the players, I guess).<br/><br/>This is why it's called a "rorschach test for the GM" - because the GM still has to supply a "scenario."<br/><br/>Otherwise, the mechanics are also fairly interesting. Heart rate and Static both work as pacing mechanisms. They seem to work best with about 3-4 agents. Playing one-on-one tends to make for short missions, with low levels of Static.<br/><br/>I really, really like Lacuna.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots" title="dyjoots"><img alt="dyjoots" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots">dyjoots</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165846/#Comment_165846" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T19:42:27+00:00" title="August 27, 2008  7:42PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 27, 2008 7:42PM by dyjoots.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are two main reasons that I like Lacuna.<br/><br/>The first is that the setting is relatively unique, but by default a straightforward monster hunt. The Agents are given their mission, and they are dropped into Blue City to hunt down a beast. The investigation and monster fight are a fun part of the game.<br/><br/>However, if that was the only feature of the game, I'm not sure I would like it as much. The straightforwardness of the "monster hunt" default assumption is turned on it's head by the mysteries inherent in the setting (the Spider Men, the Company hierarchy, Agent Miner, et al) and static. The mysteries allow you to take the game in a huge number of directions, and Static implies that the PCs (and players!) can't simply trust everything they are told. Control tells you that you should avoid the Spider Men, that Deep Blue and beyond is dangerous, that there is no "Wine" level of clearance, and that Agent Miner is a terrible person who is an enemy of the Company. The best games I've had consisted of feeding that information (or other similar information*) to the players and then having a good bit of it turn out to be fabricated, by all appearances, and for some unknown reason.<br/><br/><br/><br/>*My default convention scenario: <br/>The Mystery Agents are given a file on the HP murderer/rapist (in that order) and told that in Blue City he has a hypnotizing voice and they should not listen to anything he has to say. When they are sent in, as soon as any one of the Agents gets separated, that character is approached by the HP and told a conflicting tale. He claims to be a senator secretly working against some of the higher ups at the company who are using the technology for nefarious purposes, but someone discovered him and now he is being targeted. He's working with Miner and some others to expose the conspiracy... I then throw in stuff that is confusing and seemingly contradictory (via the Static rules).<br/><br/>I think the last time I ran it, one person voluntarily joined the HP's "cause," a few Agents died on the slab, and only one made it out of Blue City alive... in a coma. Fantastic game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/psibreaker" title="psibreaker"><img alt="psibreaker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://chestergames.myfreeforum.org/images/avatars/gallery/requests/083.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/psibreaker">psibreaker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174283/#Comment_174283" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-09T08:12:01+00:00" title="October  9, 2008  8:12AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 9, 2008 8:48AM by psibreaker.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've just picked up a copy.
