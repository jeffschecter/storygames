I've been looking at PTA because I love it, I know it, it's so flexible and we've been watching lots of tv lately. So how well does PTA work with just a producer and player? Any pitfalls to avoid?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo" title="Ronaldo"><img alt="Ronaldo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo">Ronaldo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297089/#Comment_297089" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-16T12:05:17+00:00" title="October 16, 2010 12:05PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My situation is similar since I wanted a game to play with my wife. Since 2007, PTA is the only I have played consistently. 50-100 episodes.<br/><br/>PTA does not work well with one player only because of the fan mail aspect. It is has to be given from one player to another without producer's interference. If you ply have one player, it is impossible by definition.<br/><br/>We play PTA gmless/gmful. Each plays 1 protagonist and we take turns asking for scenes. You can ask for scenes for your or the other player's protagonist. Whoever's protagonist is not in the scene has the authority over the npcs. If both protagonists are in the scene, then you split the npcs depending on who you are interacting with. <br/><br/>To find out how much budget the producer will spend on a conflict, we roll 2d6 and the difference is how many points the producer adds to the automatic 1 card he gets.<br/><br/>This system has been working wonderfully well for us. Please let me know if you have any curiosity about our experience and I will be glad to try to answer any questions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297096/#Comment_297096" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-16T15:33:58+00:00" title="October 16, 2010  3:33PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just played a one-player game of PTA with my girlfriend while we were on holiday. It worked brilliantly as an introductory game (the producer's budget gives the session a time limit; the scene framing rules give lots of structure to how to advance the story). As producer, I simply awarded her fanmail every time I thought she'd done something cool ...<br/><br/>... and she did lots of cool stuff: from minor points of characterisation (like her insipid accidental-murderer protagonist's choice of tea), to roleplaying with aplomb during a scene where two homicide detectives tried to crack her in an interrogation room. <br/><br/>As for pitfalls to avoid:<br/>Reading up on advice about how to frame conflicts is always good.<br/>Be prepared to provide support and guidance when she's unsure how to contribute or what to do next.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297103/#Comment_297103" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-16T17:38:25+00:00" title="October 16, 2010  5:38PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Allow me to shill My Supernatural Romance, a game I hacked together just to play with my wife.  <br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/codex/index.php?title=My_Supernatural_Romance" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/codex/index.php?title=My_Supernatural_Romance</a><br/>it's free...could handle a variety of types of love story or romance, and could use some playtesting from someone other than my family...<br/>And like PTA it uses playing cards for conflict resolution...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Pidgeon" title="David Pidgeon"><img alt="David Pidgeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Pidgeon">David Pidgeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297122/#Comment_297122" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-17T02:46:37+00:00" title="October 17, 2010  2:46AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to say, I was expecting you to mention that in this thread. Promotion is a good thing! I'm reading it now and I like it, although it's a single-session thing yeah? I'm looking forward to playing something ongoing with PTA, but I still think we'll be giving MSR a try. Thanks! I'll do a bit of a write-up if we do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
