I ran Shock a couple of days ago at the local game store.  I was expecting some problems based on a few AP reports I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve seen, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The game ran very smooth, with only a couple of pauses to parse the rules as written.  It may be the case that forewarned is forearmed as those pauses were at points others have mentioned:  escalating a conflict when a die roll ends up on a fulcrum, whose d4 roll to use of the players rolling, and what does it mean mechanically to re-roll a conflict (risking a link).  And I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve just noticed that the rules indicate the player to your left makes your antagonist but the player to your right plays him.  We didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t do that (the player to the left created and played the antagonists).  I suppose the division of labor could be intentional, and actually might be fun.  Hmmm\xe2\u20ac\xa6I have no doubts that our solutions to these rules lacunae may have been different from other players and even the designer\xe2\u20ac\u2122s intent.  So what, big deal. <br/>The most difficult part of the game had nothing to do with interpreting the rules.  What we found challenging was coming up with protagonist and antagonist intent in a conflict that did not contradict each other.  Once or twice we actually rolled the dice, and were figuring out the results when we realized the intents were mutually exclusive.  We quickly revised the intents and kept the rolls.  More practice will make it easier.  As well as being challenging, coming up with intents was great fun.  It was almost like a logic puzzle.  <br/>Overall, the game as a blast to play.  I can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t wait to play it again at Dexcon!<br/>I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve used the last round of the game for my podcast <a href="http://virtualplay.podbus.com/" rel="nofollow">Virtual Play</a><br/>and the complete audio file at the <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/Shock_scifi" rel="nofollow">Internet Archive</a><br/>Mel                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I think we actually did it correctly once and then I must have gotten my signals crossed.  <br/><br/>As far as the Antagonist player the pages are...p14, last para, "That Antagonist...is played by the player to your right."  And then p.22 ""Give some seed ideas about your Antagonist to the player to your left."<br/><br/>And before you mention it, I see from an earlier thread that we did the minutiae d4 rolls different than you intended (taking the higher d4 roll of the non-involved players regardless of which intent those players wanted to support or oppose.  If they wanted to modify different intents, then both dice could have been used.)  We'll just have to play again!<br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
