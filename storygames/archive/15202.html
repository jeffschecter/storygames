We generally had three games on simultaneously. The venue was fantastic: <a href="http://vivat-trust.org/properties.php?pid=109" rel="nofollow">the old observatory building</a> on Calton Hill in the middle of Edinburgh. It's an 18th century gothic pile where you can lord it over the tourists gawping at the house while playing games in magnificent rooms with the most eerie acoustics. Add to that a select group of talented, funny, imaginative, and generous group of gamers, and you get the best weekend of consistently amazing gaming I've ever had. I was honoured and privileged to attend.<br/><br/>Per's written up pair of <a href="http://darkplaces.wordpress.com/2011/10/05/nerdinburgh-ii/" rel="nofollow">before</a> and <a href="http://darkplaces.wordpress.com/2011/10/10/nerdinburgh-brought-the-awesome/" rel="nofollow">after</a> descriptions of the weekend. <br/><br/>No gaming on Friday evening, but the tone for the weekend was set with a discussion of Humph's greatest quotes ("The experts' expert [at Charades] was, of course, Lionel Blair. Who could ever forget the opposing team captain Una Stubbs sitting open mouthed as he tried to pull off '12 Angry Men' in under two minutes."; "Samantha has to go now as she\u2019s off to meet her Italian gentleman friend who\u2019s taking her out for an ice-cream. She says she likes to spend the evening licking the nuts off a large Neapolitan.") After that, the innuendoes flew thick and fast: every time there was an opening, someone would slip one in.<br/><br/>Gaming started on Saturday morning. Dust Devils with Per, Malc, Gregor, and Scott was wonderful to watch. I would say 'GM', but I did precious little of that. The players all just jumped in and took things by the throat. It was all I could do to keep up. Lots of death and mayhem, and some PCs even survived! The game also played out nearly in real time.<br/><br/>Saturday afternoon. The Agency, Matt's new game of sixties super-spies, was hysterically funny. Run by Matt, with Scott, Joe and Malc (as Vaughn Gusset, jazz impressario). The humour was the 'you had to be there' variety, but did produce quotes like 'Is that a weaponised giraffe?' 'Not again!' and post-game descriptions of events in the first big clown fight.<br/><br/>The game of Bang! on Saturday evening started well, but we hit a failure mode of too many players leading to stagnation. Eventually, we ganged up on the game itself, took it outside, and shot it.<br/><br/>Crossroads on Sunday morning was my highlight of the weekend. It's a short scenario, written by Per, that plays out in just under two hours. It's based on "The Booth at the End" series by Chris Kubasik and written for the next Fastaval. Per facilitated it, and Adam, David, Debbie and I played it. It was brilliant. Tragedy, triumph, despair, and humour, it was all there in a wonderfully intense couple of hours. <br/><br/>If you get a chance to play this, do.<br/><br/>The Cthulhu rom-com Fiasco game on Sunday afternoon was sicker and more twisted than should be spoken of. I blame Scott and Per, and vehemently disown any responsibility for what happened.<br/><br/>Sunday evening was a game of Cash 'n' Guns, which was just too much fun. The best thing was that we were making so much noise the Remember Tomorrow group, several rooms away, had to ask us to keep the noise down. Twice.<br/><br/>And that was just the games I was in! We also had Mechaton, Remember Tomorrow, Slay w/Me, Murderous Ghosts, and many others. <br/><br/>Food was another highlight of the weekend. My sous vide confit duck legs seemed to go down well, Debbie made an excellent chili with cornbread, and a lovely cake later, Adam knocked up a great pasta dish, and Joe made some wonderful home-made burgers.<br/><br/>Thanks to Per and Joe for organising the con, and thanks to everyone for the wonderful games. It was a weekend I will treasure.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielZKlein" title="DanielZKlein"><img alt="DanielZKlein" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielZKlein">DanielZKlein</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345524/#Comment_345524" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-11T02:45:13+00:00" title="October 11, 2011  2:45AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 11, 2011 2:50AM by DanielZKlein.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Even though my name's not quite David, I'll agree that Crossroads was the definite highlight <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>I'll cross-post from Google Plus:<br/><br/>So, Nerdinburgh then:<br/><br/>1) Venue, food and company was beyond divine. I could have just happily sat there and chatted with those people all weekend long. Raconteurs, the lot of you.<br/><br/>2) Bad Games. Some, for me, but I seem to have a knack for picking the worst things (for myself) in every time slot. Do: Pilgrims... didn't come together (even though it's cute), Dungeon World was shite (and this is all me, assuming it'd be an ironical narrativist twist on the dungeon crawl: it's a serious-as-all-fuck simulationist recreation of the type of game I fell out of love with when I was 16). Fiasco was alright, but I felt I didn't really contribute. I cruised along on the brilliance of Gregor Hutton and Adam Kelly, but aside from my aftermath (which I was pleased with), I didn't do much that I was happy with. I did enjoy myself, but I have higher standards for myself than that.<br/><br/>3) Good games. S/lay w/ me with Adam Kelly was great, both time, lots of thought reading involved. Mostly, though, it was +Per Fischer's Crossroads that made the weekend soar for me. Pocket play at its best, four very pleasing stories, laugh out loud funny moments married to sudden and enjoyable emotional depth, all of this compressed into 90 minutes. Between the four players (Neil, Debby, Adam and myself) and the facilitator (Per) we created four super enjoyable stories of people with unignorable desires reacting interestingly to a hard choice. It was one of those games where you want to go and write the stories you witnessed/contributed to down and show them to the world.<br/><br/>Also, I thought I was rather good for 90 minutes, there ;P<br/><br/>I'm hungry again for story gaming. This is good.<br/><br/>(Also, there was running commentary on Twitter: <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23nerdinburgh" rel="nofollow"><a href="/forums/search?Search=%23nerdinburgh&amp;Mode=like">#nerdinburgh</a></a>)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345550/#Comment_345550" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-11T09:16:03+00:00" title="October 11, 2011  9:16AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wish I could have been there.<br/><br/>Save me a space next year.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt" title="Matt"><img alt="Matt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/6464691/920923"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt">Matt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345574/#Comment_345574" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-11T12:00:15+00:00" title="October 11, 2011 12:00PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Definitely the best catered and en-beerified convention I've ever been to. Neil's sous vide confit duck legs was amazing, and there was baking and home made chilli too! Cornelius, the local off license, has an epic beer selection. The venue was wonderful, as were the attendees.<br/><br/>I played some great games too:<br/><br/>Do was great fun in the room with the insane acoustics. Of the two letters we played, the 2nd with its steampunk stylings was the most enjoyable. A few systematic issues presented themselves.<br/><br/>The Agency... Aside from doing my normal trick of mixing pre-release rules with the final ones, it was a riotous pun fest with gadgets, girls, jazz and evil science clowns. (Available soon!)<br/><br/>Mechaton - Giant fighty Lego robots smashed each other up! 5 players is always fun, but rather turned into a 2 and 3 player game... <br/><br/>Remember Tomorrow - I suggested a partly flooded London setting and people ran with it. Some great scenes with scavengers, memory traders and a suspicious entity called Geneva.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cthulahoops" title="cthulahoops"><img alt="cthulahoops" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cthulahoops">cthulahoops</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345587/#Comment_345587" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-11T14:30:35+00:00" title="October 11, 2011  2:30PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fantastic con!<br/><br/>Do was extremely interesting, although I'm not sure it worked very well.  It didn't really feel like a roleplaying game and we got very bogged down in trying to come up with interesting ways to reuse the same sources of trouble over and over again.  I think of it as almost an exercise - "hey, how many different ways can you think of to work not taking things seriously into a story".  In the end though, it just started to feel like hard work.  I'd to play it in a smaller group, or maybe online, to see how it works.<br/><br/>I got to try S/Lay W/Me with David (that's what he gets for surname-ing me).  I've wanted to play for a long time and was really glad I did.  In the evening we told the story of the son of a demon who travelled to the crystal court to find his soul, and in the morning the story the old bard and the unintentionally yonic landscape.  (Or maybe that's just me.)   I think the highlight of both stories was some extremely evocative imaginary.   In contrast, I'm not sure either lover worked out that well, the first being a vague damsel in distress with a bit of a purity thing going on.   I aimed more for more of priestess who knows the secrets of this place thing, but I'm not sure it came across.  As such, both games stayed fairly chaste and both lovers ended up dead.   I need to play more of this.<br/><br/>Crossroads was, as others have said, excellent.   We ended up with great and contrasting stories.  I especially liked the way Daniel crossed his story into mine by making his character my mother.   Without this, the game is very pocket play with each player providing playing almost their own game, and providing most of their own opposition too.  I was a little disappointed not to get to more about my author/world's worst dealer author and some drug gangs.  Debbie's story about love, bookshops and explosive urine was a thing of beauty.<br/><br/>Fiasco was good but weird.  We played Fiasco High.  We made some good high school drama but none of it really escalated into a proper fiasco, and I didn't end up feeling like a I knew who Jenny Tabuno (the good twin) was.  We had some hilarious scenes, but sort of wrapped everything up too neatly with a round of scenes to go and ended up with little to do.  I so should have killed Jenny off in my second last scene.  Next time.   Considering all this, it was fun to see what happened in the aftermath.   Daniel rolled 1 black, and was at a loss as to how to get from the happy ending to horrible.  I said something vague about making it about the story of life after school and something clicked for Daniel and next thing I know he's blowing up an abortion clinic.   Good work.<br/><br/>A fine con finished with the sleeping overnight on a train game.  An interesting reinterpretation of the medium but it could have done with more plot.  Even something cliched like a murder would have worked well.  Breakfast was good though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
