I've become addicted to stories in which the main events of a narrative unfold against a backdrop of much broader, world-altering changes that only very rarely effect the lives of the protagonists.<br/><br/>This is a type of storytelling that lends itself naturally to television. Consider, for example, the slow revelation of the existence of a parallel universe in <i>Fringe,</i>, the "smoking man" stuff in <i>The X Files</i> or the development of the River Tam subplot, with all of its implications, in <i>Firefly</i>. In all of these series, as well as <i>Lost</i> (though its producers ultimately screwed the pooch by failing to provide any sort of a coherent denouement), there's usually a fairly small, self-contained story told in each episode, interspersed with vague hints about bigger, scarier events that are usually just out of the characters' reach.<br/><br/>The earliest clear examples I can remember coming across of this style of narrative, though, is in the novels of William Gibson. In <i>Neuromancer</i>, <i>Count Zero</i> and <i>Mona Lisa Overdrive</i>, the gradual development of sentience by the whole of Cyberspace, and its ensuing search for company, is always hanging over the plot without ever quite mattering to the characters, except in a few very isolated (and wonderfully dramatic) scenes.  I've run one RPG in which I was able to pull off this type of storytelling (a 9-month nWoD campaign using the <i>Hunter</i> rules), but it has proven an extremely difficult to reproduce.<br/><br/>I'd be interested to hear peoples' views about whether I've discovered a genuine pattern here, whether and under what conditions such a story might be effectively GM-ed, and other cool examples that I haven't mentioned here.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317001/#Comment_317001" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-17T17:05:22+00:00" title="March 17, 2011  5:05PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this is a genuine pattern, a very economical one.  It allows X-Files to follow a monster-of-the-week format, but dribble out tantalizing clues to the larger picture at an excruciatingly slow pace, keeping everyone hooked for more.<br/><br/>I suspect part of the trouble of marshalling this in role-playing game is the collaborative nature of the exercise.  As a script-writer, you can discover a powerful emotional current, concoct the perfect time to inject a whiff of the overarching plot, and then go back and weave in appropriate foreshadowing, etc. It's an iterative process.<br/><br/>With a role-playing game, you have four script-writers, you write linearly (generally) and you're stuck with your first draft.  Players tend to veer toward the most interesting thing, which reduces your ability to keep the tantalizing cues just out of reach.. that's not satisfying.  In the X-Files, [the writer behind] Mulder and Scully are actually colluding to keep the overarching plot only overarching.  For players, introducing the CSM to inject a bit of overarching plot - then having him fade into the background - is likely to cause them to spend 45 minutes chasing him down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317005/#Comment_317005" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-17T17:20:18+00:00" title="March 17, 2011  5:20PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            True. You'd need the players' buy-in to keep such a game from turning into a giant frustrating exercise. (This can probably be done in-fiction, if the players agree to a frame which explains why certain information is out of reach, say.)<br/><br/>I have a shorter-run game called Land of Nodd, and my favourite thing about it is that it creates the feeling of a bigger plot just outside the full knowledge of any of the players. But in that game, there is no GM, so the mysterious meta-plot isn't known to *anyone* at the table: it's a very different thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317020/#Comment_317020" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-17T18:28:14+00:00" title="March 17, 2011  6:28PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 17, 2011 6:31PM by lordgoon.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, one of the things that allowed my nWoD thing to work was that they players were all at different levels, which allowed for a lot more GM railroading than a group of uniformly experienced Storygamers would have been prepared to tolerate.<br/><br/>Is there a way to make this kind of thing a matter of mechanics, perhaps, though? Perhaps there's a way to encourage collaboration, but have somebody be the "metaplot guy" in a way that wouldn't just collapse into a GM-like role. or maybe there's a way of introducing random events into a game that could be tied up into a metaplot by the players at the denouement (thought this might ruin the fun).

People are there to play, they want to get into the story and start pushing and pulling and making things happen.  When you declare that something is part of the backdrop and will hardly ever (possibly <i>never</i>) be within the characters' reach, you're basically fencing that stuff off and telling the players that while their characters are free to hold opinions about that backdrop, it will be a waste of their time to try and interact with it directly.  If the players are paying attention, they will take this to heart and not invest too much in that backdrop: their attention and interest will always get a much bigger and far more rewarding return from caring about something that <i>is</i> part of the main narrative.<br/><br/>Which is not necessarily a problem...it just means that when you drop in a little bit of that backstory here and there, you have to be thoughtful about it.<br/><br/>- First and foremost, it helps to get buy-in from the players.  Make it clear to them what the game is actually about, and get some consensus about what is and is not going to be a big deal.  Even something as simple as "River has psychic powers, but this game is not about hunting down the people responsible for experimenting on her: the characters are going to keep away from the Alliance, not confront them" can make a huge difference between an interesting backstory (why does the Alliance even want psychic assassins in the first place?  what other secret projects are they hiding?) and a disappointing mess of red-herring plot hooks that go nowhere and satisfy no one.  And if people say, no, we really want to know all about the Alliance's secret torture experiments on teenagers and do something about it, that's something you want to know sooner rather than later!<br/><br/>- You need to work hard to make that backstory flow smoothly into the main narrative.  You need to sell it as being relevant and illuminating without unintentionally suggesting it as an actual plot hook if you have no intention of following that plot to any kind of conclusion.  A good strategy for doing this is might be to attach it to an NPC:  pick some antagonist, and figure out how the backstory has affected that NPC and shaped his or her motivations.  The NPC isn't directly involved in the backstory and doesn't interact with it any more directly than the PCs do, but as the PCs figure out what that antagonist is all about, those backstory elements will slide right in without feeling like they came out of nowhere.  (Actually, I think attaching characters to anything you want players to care about is a good strategy:  it's one thing to, say, fight the Empire, and another thing to fight Darth Vader.  Characters are always better than abstract concepts or faceless organizations, in my experience.)<br/><br/>- It's probably also a good idea to figure out who you're doing the backstory for in the first place.  Is it just as good for you to know that the backstory is there and is shaping the events of the game even if the other players never seem to notice, or do you need their attention and praise for it to be satisfying to you?  If it's something you can enjoy for its own sake, your job gets a hell of a lot easier: you can have fun with the backstory and let it shape how you play the game, and don't need to worry about how to balance it against the main narrative.  If you need an audience for it to work, though, you have to be a little more careful: you don't want to find yourself taking away their ability to effect change in the setting in order to protect your metaplot, you don't want to see their eyes glaze over as you tell them about something none of them have any reason to care about, and you don't want to seem like you're springing things on them out of nowhere.<br/><br/>- In some groups, I think you can make good use of out-of-game channels to lay out backstory and weave it into the main narrative.  Talk about it out of character, send e-mails around, put it on the wiki, whatever.  If people are happy getting that kind of detail outside of play, you might as well take advantage of that.<br/><br/>- If you're good with prep, you could even set up mini-episode/intermission scenes:  pass out pregen character sheets of  people who are directly involved with whatever backstory element you want to deal with and play out a scene with them (everyone plays someone in a squad of Alliance marines who are cleaning up the aftermath of the Serenity crew's latest adventure, when suddenly two spooky men in nice suits with blue gloves show up...).  That way everyone at the table gets to participate in the backstory instead of simply being told about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317032/#Comment_317032" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-17T20:34:47+00:00" title="March 17, 2011  8:34PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In those series you mention, the characters do interact with the backstory though, dont they?  slowly, but surely they do.<br/><br/>You could improvise the backstory by identifying a couple of major 'players' that drive it, and assign them some motivations, and have 'them' act on those motivations occasionally in ways that impact on or are at least visible to the PCs.

It's what we would refer to as giving a story depth, rather than just being eye-candy or entertainment only.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn games? There are two ways you can make a sub plot. The first is to plan it, of course. But that can be a painful experience if your players don't take the bait and refuse to start digging. Demons invading and if we don't get the McGuffin then the doors to reality will slam? Meh, I'm gonna steal that jewelled crown instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other way is to allow it to spontaneously evolve and, if you are a GM, PRETEND that you knew about it all the time and were just feeding it out piecemeal.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy creating memorable antagonists and by conveying the illusion that the world around the characters has some kind of life outside of their actions, they will start to make connections. They will notice things and think that you put them there. They will ask pointed questions. You take notes. You look enigmatic. They will give you clues about many sub plots, and you can add a few clues as you too think about it. They will think you have something to hide, when the reality is they are building a subplot that they themselves find satisfying because they unconsciously invented it. It is a self fulfilling prophecy situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nEventually you will all 'discover' the sub plot, and if you have done your job properly they will think that you had it designed all along.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317070/#Comment_317070" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-18T10:19:09+00:00" title="March 18, 2011 10:19AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2011 10:20AM by Paul_T.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Making it explicit and getting player buy-in can be accomplished through mechanics as well.<br/><br/>Let's say you have a pool of "Subplot Tokens", and they're hard to win (maybe the group as a whole only gets one Token per session of play).

If you have any questions just let me know.<br/><br/>I haven't heard from ANYONE who has actually played the English edition of the game. Who knows, it could be complete gibberish. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
