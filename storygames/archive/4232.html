You go in a dungeon, you come back out.<br/>\n<br/>\nCompare to Mentzer D&amp;D;, which has a game plan that extends for over 36+ levels:<br/>\n1) The dungeon<br/>\n2) The wilderness and establishing a fiefdom.<br/>\n3) Dominion play<br/>\n4) Planar play and questing for immortality.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has *nothing* to do with the quality of any game.

I think when many people are thinking about a long D&amp;D; campaign, what they're really hoping for is a game experience that feels like an epic novel -- <i>Lord of the Rings</i> + Beholders.  And that's actually a huge drag: first, because D&amp;D; does not support anything resembling an epic story, and two, because D&amp;D;'s power structure places an enormous burden (even in the best of times) on the Dungeon Master and assigning him to create plots, subplots, cute little setting twists, etc. is a recipe for burn-out.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the absolute greatest achievements of the Story Games Designers is that you can create an epic novel (okay, epic short story most of the time) collaboratively, <i>sometimes with zero prep</i>.  And epic not just in terms of high stakes and bildungsroman power curves, but often with genuine emotional resonance and appeal.  It's a huge accomplishment.  Ron, Clinton, Luke, Ben, and all those other guys doing bad-ass fantasy story-games--that's really something to take great pride in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a style of play that is basically dungeon-delving, very loosely connected in a semi-consistent setting is far more achievable in D&amp;D;, at least when you're fairly low-level.  (I would actually love to play this way, never having done so in middle school.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95157/#Comment_95157" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T11:45:12+00:00" title="September 12, 2007 11:45AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>The two of them aren't either/or propositions.

The Japanese RPG Meikyuu Kingdom (or "Make You Kingdom!")is actually wholly based on a mixture of nation-building and dungeon crawling (albeit in a very tongue-in-cheek kind of way).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>As for popularity, keep in mind that we're talking about a game that wasn't even designed to be particularly successful in the first place, but to maintain the legal fiction that there was a distinct game called AD&amp;D that Dave Arneson didn't own. Despite this, it still has an active fanbase more than 20 years later. That's not "rejection" by my measurement.</blockquote>\nI was referring to a rejection of those elements of the game, not the game itself. As in, they tried putting stuff about being rulers into the game and apparently -- from my limited anecdotal experience -- people weren't actually playing it that way. When people talked about the differences between basic and advanced D&amp;D they would focus on how elves and dwarves are classes in the former, not the absence of rules for running a kingdom in the latter. I could be totally off, but that would explain why D&amp;D3e, with the market research Ryan Dancey touted so much, made no effort whatsoever to address those points in its core rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95218/#Comment_95218" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T13:57:43+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  1:57PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>Making D&amp;D like WoW is a great way to et D&amp;D players to play WoW, while not giving WoW players anything they can't get from WoW.</blockquote>\nWhen did anyone at WotC say they were doing this?<br><br>And to bring the thread back on track... why should the WotC staff playing WoW and various not-D&amp;D RPGs mean that they are turning D&amp;D into a WoW-like or not-D&amp;D-like RPG?

Playing Inspectres doesn't strike me as something particularly applicable to addressing D&amp;D's evolution. Playing games that specifically speak to ways to play D&amp;D better, do. Playing WoW is necessary to understand its appeal, but many of its design lessons are a poison pill because they're things WoW does better. I'd like to see R&amp;D play games that have this sort of thing to offer, and I think campaign-level play is a particular issue that they need to approach with new thinking, because they haven't had any new thinking in 20+ years.

The question is whether or not this is an innovative way to get tabletop gamers together, and facilitate their play, or just drifting towards WOW. I don't know if that's an easy call to make. I won't even speculate, but instead wait to see what happens with it in terms of how it grows or shrinks the D&amp;D playing populace. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I'd agree with Malcolm about is that it certainly won't bring any WOW players over to playing tabletop. It's best hope is to "reactivate" gamers who've been finding it hard to play tabletop because of a lack of player network. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jzn" title="jzn"><img alt="jzn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jzn">jzn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95405/#Comment_95405" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-13T08:14:49+00:00" title="September 13, 2007  8:14AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A subscription based engine for D&amp;D play support and supplements isn't neccessarily a rip off of WoW.

In general, it seems like they're trying to facilitate the needs of the majority.<br/><br/>As for the online game table, it's just another means to facilitate fans actually playing.
