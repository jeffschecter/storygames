I want to find out more about them. I believe, even though lots of people believe different, that it's possible to understand what a dream is about, to a certain extent. However, it's like learning a different language without having a dictionary (and not always a context), so the process of interpretation is a bit random and exploratory, for me.<br/><br/>So that's where I'm coming from: I'd like to have a look at people's dreams and try to figure out what I think they might be saying. So if you'd like to post or whisper a dream (preferably recent and fresh), I'll try to "read" it and see what comes out. Please let me know if you want me to reply in a whisper or in public!<br/><br/>As you understand, this is by no means a reliable or professional thing - it's just for fun (for both of us), for possible learning (for me and possibly you), and for inspiration for my game &amp; book (for me, which will hugely benefit The Whole World once these brilliant works of art are finished).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254671/#Comment_254671" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T02:11:34+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  2:11AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alright, I had a pretty cool dream recently. <br/><br/>There was a LARP (I've only ever LARPed once but my roommates do often) that took place in a post apocalyptic world, evil sentient darkness that looked like brown clouds covered the world. A was new in town, a bounty hunter with a shiny plastic gun. The people in the town were wary of me and I climbed up to the mayor (who was played by one of my roommates) and explained my mission. He pointed at my shiny and brightly colored plastic gun and asked what kind of weapon it was and I told him it's a model from the 2020's, all guns looked like that back then. Entire town has an awkward silence, the world ended in 2010 and I hadn't read the background.<br/><br/>Anyway I hide the gun behind a wall section, because it will be cool if someone who is not supposed to have it finds it and causes trouble. I chat with some guy about my past and while telling him we view the story as if it were a TV clip and it's more real than the whole LARP episode, it actually happened. I had had a beautiful wife who had also been a bounty hunter but the darkness descended upon her with grabbing blue hands (she is lying down in the dirt) and they rip her soul out and I'm relieved it wasn't more brutal than that but just as I think that brown hands descend upon her and tear her to pieces, she screams is pain and terror and the view zooms in on her head and her cervical spine segments line up like a little snake and I think "that's silly".<br/><br/>My 2-3 children are standing by her grave mourning, the grave is indoors but still a patch of earth. The brown cloud descends through the roof and starts shooting roses down the grave so it gets covered in a thick flower bed. The kids rush in to it and are all happy because their mothers grave look to beautiful but bugs crawl out of the roses which rot and they run screaming out of the room in to the arms of my new wife who looks alot like my old wife but kind of ugly (uneven chin) and she tells them not to mourn their old mother because the darkness killed her and surely wants to kill them too.<br/><br/>Then me and my roommates are driving through an apocalyptic landscape (sun shining now) which is the ruins of a mall outside my home town and a naked old man is standing in the debris and following our pickup but the speed past him. He is Arne Weise, a swedish TV-profile. My friends say he is a terrible man and a pedophile.<br/><br/>Make your guess and I can make mine!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254688/#Comment_254688" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T04:39:27+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  4:39AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Last night I dreamed I parked my truck in Portage, Alaska next to a light pole, and noticed that there was a young man hanging from it. He was obviously dead and his body was all torn up. I walked away and was about to call the police when I saw a small crowd gather and cut the guy down. I thought it was foolish for them to mess with a crime scene. <br/><br/>Then, in perfect dream logic, I went into a nearby house and watched some television - my real life neighbor was being interviewed. There was a feeling of dread about the place. Then there was the noise of a vehicle engine, and I looked out the window to see a tow truck with three people and a robot piling out of it. I knew right away that they were the ones who had killed the guy and hung him from the streetlight. It was very scary - I knew they would kill me as well if they caught me. The robot looked like a dumb 1930's mechanical man.<br/><br/>So I ran out the front door and knocked the robot down and raced toward the parking lot where my truck was, with the three men chasing after me. Suddenly my wife was with me, and we were both running, and I realized I had taken a revolver from the house. As we ran I opened the cylinder and saw that it was a .22, and that it had a single round of ammunition in it. That's when I woke up. My dreams are not usually this terrifying.<br/><br/>(I went to bed reading a book about high angle rescue and mountaineering medicine)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BastardToadflax" title="BastardToadflax"><img alt="BastardToadflax" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BastardToadflax">BastardToadflax</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254693/#Comment_254693" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T05:39:39+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  5:39AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was keeping a dream log for a while <a href="http://mazirian.livejournal.com" rel="nofollow">here</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254703/#Comment_254703" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T06:24:34+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  6:24AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: BastardToadflax</cite>I was keeping a dream log for a while<a href="http://mazirian.livejournal.com" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</blockquote>\nThose are all fairly old - do you have anything more recent?

We lived in the sky, in dramatically rusted buildings, each with one open side.  The conquerors had closed off this side with a sort of tough netting.  And some guards of course.<br/><br/>A man appeared from the bottom edge outside the open wall, and said something about rescuing us.  He had unfastened the netting from the bottom and reached out a hand to one of the people milling about uncertainly.  One ran forward and grabbed his hand, about to swing down to safety, but instead his expression turned cruelly gleeful and he shouted "This is what happens to those who try to escape!" and flung him off to fall, screaming.<br/><br/>As I watched him fall in horror, I saw it... the dimensional portal (a giant square of sparkly white lights)  I kicked the bad guy off the edge and dove into the air myself, angling for the portal.<br/><br/>Along the way I saw the planet below through the thin clouds.  Blue and green and gold-brown. Then I noticed that some of the landmasses were actually floating at various heights, and further noted that I was about to smash into one.<br/><br/>Next to me I saw one of my friends who had taken the opportunity to escape with me, and she was sort of skating on the clouds, able to control her descent.  I tried this and found the clouds surprisingly firm once i was actually trying to stand on them rather than fall through them, and slid down to the portal<br/><br/>it seems the same dudes who had subjugated my people really got around.  Several of us who'd made it through ended up in a dreary cave, with pathetic looking sort of seal shaped beings being taunted by the same aliens, witholding food and water until they could barely move.<br/><br/>We somehow made it through to their storeroom, killed the guards there (by this point we were armed), and gathered up all the mushrooms and grassy stuff we could find. We went back through the tunnels quickly passing out the food and (mushroom)drinks to everyone.<br/><br/>This of course brought on the attention of the demon overseer, complete with reddish skin, flaming eyes, cloven hooves and batlike wings.<br/><br/>The downtrodden seal things rallied with their new energy and helped us kill the fucker.  I took his sword, and we ran for the next portal, which I had glimpsed while passing out victuals<br/><br/>It was, of course, guarded and there was a metal grate over it, but we took care of those minor details and squeezed through the small opening.<br/><br/>The next world was sort of a dystopian future sort of place, Big Brother alien on the speakers.  Lots of slightly rusted steel.<br/><br/>Big Brother was actually more of a Big Sister. But anyway, we found that the next portal was through a tunnel hidden inside the women's bathroom, but we got caught clearing out all the broken bits of metal and such that she'd blocked it off with.<br/><br/>We escaped but the next time we planned to go back in, Big Sister announced over the loudspeaker that she was barring the door with bronze so no one would ever get in or out again.  We opted for in, sneaking through before the work-slaves, carrying the heavy grating.  I think they saw us but opted not to say anything.<br/><br/>It was very dark, and there was little hope of escape, with the sounds of hammering and drilling behind us.  Big Sister's gloating echoed through the hallway as we dug through some more debris.  Then I realized I was actually hearing her speak into the microphone in addition to the broadcast.  I laid down on the floor, and saw there was a little square hole opening directly into her room.<br/><br/>She was a possessed human, one of those sort of aging hollywood starlet types, fussing about and primping.  Then her little dog came to lay down by the hole, and I pulled back, hoping he wouldn't notice me.<br/><br/>Then to my shock, the dog quietly told me that he had arranged for the hidden door at the next hole down, to be open by tomorrow at three.<br/><br/>Big Sister, looked down at him sharply, "What was that?"  The dog replied, "...enjoy a beer?"<br/><br/>Big Sister laughed, knowing something was up, she scooped up the dog and put him on a high shelf, murmuring something about how he was such a precious little thing etc.<br/><br/>When we hurried to the next hole, the hallway was filled with blinding light as the door opened, and she stepped through.<br/><br/>She was stronger than she looked, and armed with a crystal sword.  It glowed with icy flame.  After an intense battle, I knocked her on the ground and wrested her sword away from her, lifting it for a killing strike<br/><br/>She screamed "No! You can't defeat me! We are stronger than you!"<br/><br/>I laughed (as the camera pulled back to show the view of me kneeling on her chest.)  I reached behind me to draw the twin sword, with a flourish, twirling them around my hands.  "I've already slain your kind."  Then I drove them both into her heart.<br/><br/>A deep voice echoed through the hallway.  "That sword did not belong to her. It was mine."<br/><br/>I looked up to see another demon, and quickly jumped to my feet.  He made no move other than looking at me expectantly, and I nodded and tossed him the sword.<br/><br/>**<br/><br/>Now I was the demon, bowed to the girl in the hallway, turned, and ran for the portal.<br/><br/>I leapt through the portal and spread my wings, having found myself in the air.  I looked around and laughed.<br/><br/>This world was seemingly untouched, looking like nothing so much as a mario-style video game, made from clay.  It was cartoony and bright, and the land was cartoony clouds, with brightly piled easter eggs and such just waiting to be jumped on.<br/><br/>I obliged.<br/><br/>The end                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joanna" title="Joanna"><img alt="Joanna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joanna">Joanna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255171/#Comment_255171" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-05T06:19:16+00:00" title="February  5, 2010  6:19AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This was from a couple weeks ago<br/><br/>--------<br/><br/>I was visiting a girlfriend. She was showing me some photos that were taken of her while she was taking some training classes.<br/><br/>Her husband called from work to tell her about a band that was playing in the area. It was one of her favorite bands but I had never heard of them. We couldn't make the show for some reason, but we went out that night to wave them off as they left town.<br/><br/>We were in a small town in the country. Lots of dust kicked up as we drove through the dark. The vehicles were all older 20's-like models.<br/><br/>The band had a big touring van that looked more like a pirate ship on wheels. It was a party atmosphere as they were pulling out of town. Kids climbed the sides of the boat. The guys in the band were hanging over the sides laughing and joking with the fans. People were singing.<br/><br/>Then the scene changed.<br/><br/>The actor Ben Stein had moved back to his elderly mother's farm. She was grouchy about it but put up with him. He dug a moat around three sides of one of their fields as part of an experimental planting program.<br/><br/>In the house, he had a basket of apples. They were lovely vintage varieties in all shades of red and pink. When I complimented them, he gave me some. The ones he gave me were miniature and grew in clusters like cherries. But they were smaller than cherries, closer to cranberry sized. I was eating them in tiny bites around the core. They were perfectly juicy and sweet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stryck" title="stryck"><img alt="stryck" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stryck">stryck</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255192/#Comment_255192" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-05T08:21:21+00:00" title="February  5, 2010  8:21AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            last night i dreamt...<br/><br/>2/5/10<br/><br/>I snuck into a rival's home base to steal some sort of book.  This went off smoothly, and I returned to my house.  Some time later, while just finishing reading it, I discovered she had sent an agent to get it back.  I noticed him as he was about to attack, and fought back. My security team and I subdued and secured him, then I decided to make a gesture of goodwill and give the book back.<br/><br/>So I basically walked into my rival's home base, and immediately had guns pointed at me.  I said I was only here to give the book back, and kept walking towards her, slowly, with the book out like an offering.  She seemed surprised but took no chances, and soon I was in handcuffs and rather put-out by the whole thing.  I supposed it was possible she was going to exchange me for her agent, since I did still have him.<br/><br/>I didn't seem to be guarded all that well, aside from being followed by stern-looking men, so I wandered around the house, checking out the security (all the screen doors were padlocked shut!) and talking to people.  I realized that I didn't actually want to be enemies anymore, so I made some more friendly gestures towards my rival.  She seemed sad that her cat and her monkey kept running away from her, so I showed her how to entice them to stay and be petted.  She seemed to thaw a bit towards me, and we talked for a while.  We seemed to have an uneasy truce, and she let me out of the handcuffs although I was still guarded.<br/><br/>Later, I stole the padlock key for the doors from one of the guards and pocketed it, waiting for an opportune time to use it.  Eventually, I slipped away from the guards, unlocked the door, and looked for my car.  It was there, but I decided to just sit on the front porch - after stashing my keys behind a TV that was outside.  I listened to the sounds of panic and alarm from inside while I enjoyed the sunshine.  After a few minutes I heard people coming for me...<br/><br/>but then I woke up.<br/>Went back to sleep.<br/><br/>Now I was locked in a room, handcuffed again. I irritatedly asked the omniscient observer what had happened, because I didn't remember but I sure as hell didn't try to attack anyone.  She told me that several agents had discovered me on the porch and tried to kill me, so I fought back and now I was there.  I sighed in disgust. When would these people understand that I wasn't their enemy anymore? <br/><br/>Somehow I got out of the cuffs, and when the guard opened the door to give me food or something, I knocked him down and ran.  I hid in one of the bathroom stalls for a while, figuring they'd be looking for me outside.  I rather enjoyed listening to the chaos again.This seemed to work fairly well, but eventually people checked the bathroom.  I had disguised myself a little, and walked out like I was meant to be there, heading for the door again.  Of course they'd taken my key but I had had enough of trying to be friends, and dodged guards and agents, kicked open the screen door, and scrammed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255223/#Comment_255223" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-05T11:33:05+00:00" title="February  5, 2010 11:33AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dreamt I was reading a literary journal.

I was like "C'mon Gaudi, I know it's closed but surely YOU can get us in! You're awesome and important"<br/>and he was like "but it's closed!"<br/>Jonathan: o.o<br/>9:57 AM me: and i was like "pleeeeease?"<br/>and he was like "wellllll... I can't get you in OFFICIALLY but I know this way we can sneak in..."<br/>  me: and so we snuck into the Sagrada Familia, which was (of course) still under construction - but it was at the point where it was still only Gaudi's part of the church, the new stuff hadn't been added on to it, so only the main facade had been built, and the spires weren't completed yet<br/>and I went around taking secret pictures with my 2010 camera<br/>and then Gaudi gave us puppies<br/>  Jonathan: :O<br/>me: but I requested a kitty instead, so he gave me this little grey one<br/>Jonathan: Gaudi rocks!<br/>me: he DOES<br/>he's my favorite!<br/><br/>Note: Gaudi is a famous Spanish architect. The Sagrada Familia is an amazing church that he partially built before he died.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259606/#Comment_259606" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-02T09:08:04+00:00" title="March  2, 2010  9:08AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Oh!
