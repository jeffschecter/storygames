This is just the start, I will refine and develop--but the idea has been planted. Please let me know what you think.<br/><br/>Teaser:<br/><br/><br/>I want you all to meet Joe Black.<br/><br/>He\u2019s been down in the rabbit-hole for thirty-six months and it\u2019s time now that we bring him back up. Joe\u2019s trauma was so severe from the accident that for the first year he was left alone to heal. During this time our medical technologies were used to evaluate his head injury and diagnose the coma. We\u2019ve been forthright in our rehabilitation plan, making sure his body has gotten the proper nutrients, turned and clean to limit bed sores, as well as electrotherapy to retard both skeletal and muscular atrophy. But the hope of his recovery diminished with each passing week.<br/><br/>We began more radical neurological treatments, using functional magnetic resonance imaging and advanced trans-cranial electromagnetic therapy to increase brain activity. Joe was slowly improving and into a place where we could somehow reach him. By the end of the second year, his mind was showing significant signs of activity. There was a chance that he could indeed wake from his coma. However, the progression eventually plateaued and Joe could could get no further. That\u2019s when we brought in Dr. Nolan Michaels.<br/><br/>The neuroscientist and his production team came on board with our full cooperation after learning about his remarkable results.  He\u2019s noted for his unconventional methods and an experimental treatment of opening a window into the movies in our subconscious. This is much more than merely playing back video of someone\u2019s memories. Dr. Michaels is able to broadcast film imagery into Joe\u2019s mind and match the brain activity pattern. This same imagery is broadcast repeatedly to provide a vivid, stable environment and Joe was pulled out of Perdition--but there was still a long ways to go.<br/><br/>Within the subconscious mind, visually the world unfolds much like a movie does. Yet no two people experience dreams in quite the same way. It begins when the  Dr. Michaels methods works similar in the way a director\u2019s cut of a film is made. After the \u2018projectionist\u2019 ]is attaches to the subject--in this case for Joe it\u2019s Casablanca--Dr. Michaels acts as the \u2018auteur\u2019 and is able to edit the \u2018cinedream\u2019 making subtle changes and inserting easter eggs. <br/><br/>Within the cinedream Joe has taken the role of one of the characters. Reliving the the film over and over. In the cinedream what he sees, feels, tastes, hears and smells is as authentic as any waking reality. Joe cannot be woken in real time--he must be retrieved by someone else going into the cinedream and then bringing him out. As \u2018cameos\u2019 that is where you come in. Now this is just a brief summation of  the screening, really there is much more to it.<br/><br/>Welcome to CRITERION.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Coming soon to www.criterion-cite.com                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352096/#Comment_352096" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-20T23:33:35+00:00" title="December 20, 2011 11:33PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 21, 2011 12:37AM by vgunn.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some additional background information. All still subject to change. Comments welcomed!<br/><br/><br/><br/>First we had to find Joe Black. A coma is defined as patients who cannot be aroused to a wakeful state and in whom there is an absence of spontaneous eye opening. Outwardly Joe is lying on a bed apparently in a deep sleep. His chest rises and falls, but he shows no other signs of life. While in the coma, his subconscious self is lost--in a place Dr. Michaels calls Perdition.<br/><br/>Perdition is the deepest state of dreaming and the furthest your mind is from reality. We all know what that\u2019s like: the deeper you sleep, the harder it is to be woken up and the more vivid and lucid a dream becomes. There are no physical cues which can wake you up--such as the sensation of falling or having to go to the bathroom, even say, being killed. This because you're not really sleeping. You're in a coma.<br/><br/>According to some theologies, Perdition is used as a synonym for hell. Perdition is also referred in culture as hell on earth, or even just the severe distortion of the way things are. What it is to Joe Black is a bottomless, unstructured dream space for the subconscious his mind and where time runs fast enough for him to become lost forever and never emerge out from his coma. His was wandering alone in the burned out confusion of his memories, making the distinction between reality and the lucid dream impossible to distinguish.<br/><br/>[ - insert paragraph of search and rescue here - ]<br/><br/>Think back to the exhilaration of watching your first summer blockbuster as a child. How you could not wait to see your favorite movie again and again. Perhaps you even stayed the entire day in the theatre for each and every one of the showings. But one thing to remember here is that the mind and brain are both different things. The mind does not surrounds space and time but the brain does. So instead of merely sitting in the audience, Joe was actually playing out a part in the movie. His mind \u2018attached\u2019 itself to the cinedream and it became his reality. Every day, like clockwork, the showtimes run and he acts out his role. This routine provides his mind the stability and structure which did not exist in Perdition. And refuses to let go of it, trapping his subconscious self and keeping him in the coma.<br/><br/>The challenge is to find a way for Joe to intentionally escape by making realize he is in a cinedream, but this has to be done without him \u2018walking-out\u2019 on it and suffering a false-awaking. There are many obstacles which stand in your way. First and foremost is you don\u2019t know who Joe is. He has taken the role of one of the characters in the film. Making this harder is that he may be playing or replaying someone different in each screening. Convincing him of the dream and ushering to the exit will be even more difficult. <br/><br/>And there is more . . . much more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
