I hear there's a good gaming store over that way, and was just seeing if there were any S-Gers out in that general direction. I'll have a crazy schedule that week, but can definitely free up a night for a meet-up.<br/><br/>Heh, long shot and all that. Still, if anyone's out there, give me a holler in the next week or two.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
