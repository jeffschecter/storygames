It was entitled GameWang! Why GameWang!, I hear you cry? Well, mainly because of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJDu5D_IXbc" rel="nofollow">this</a>.<br/><br/>Anyway, lots of games were played (including the much in demand sessions of D&amp;D 4e), fun was had, barbecue was cooked, frisbees were thrown (sometimes with alarming results) and drink was drank. A few actual plays even came out of this, such as:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.collective-endeavour.com/node/1385" rel="nofollow"><b>3:16</b> ; Wangtabulous!

I found I was rusty on the rules (shame!) but the fictional stuff flew off the bat. Stuart that I was playing it with had never played BTI before but was keen for it. We had this Hugh Grant/Colin Firth/Bridget Jones style RomCom. Great. It's such a simple and rewarding game. True love came through in the end but only when the last three Attraction dice landed on 5s and 6s on the final roll! Almost a heartbreaker.<br/><br/><b>D&amp;D4e</b> was interesting. It really reminded me of playing Heroquest (the GW version) and I ended up playing a Halfling ... DeathMachine. Or Rogue as they seem to be called. I found very little playing "in character" but the combat was solid and the kobolds got a real thumping from our Paladin ("Dave") and Mr Dwarfy. My halfling was like a Gloryhound poacher, though. Running in and stabbing for huge damage. It's a fun game, but utterly divorced from the fantasy fiction of my youth. Most of the other players of  the game play(ed) WoW and they were more au fait with all of that, to be honest. Anyway, it was fun and solid and easy to play.<br/><br/>I also played Joe Prince's forthcoming <b>Labyrinths &amp; Lycanthropes</b>, which was great and very amusing. We got thumped by a Ninja in that game,and I couldn't help but think it was actually just a Halfling Rogue from D&amp;D4e as it decimated the party. Luckily, we got the sod in the end and looted the Cave of Unpleasantness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
