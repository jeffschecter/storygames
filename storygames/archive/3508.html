Half of the detail is necessary for context, the other is me just talking.<br/><br/>Just over a week ago I found out about Go Play SouthEast.  I immediately pitched it to the wife since she has family in Rogersville (half an hour away) as a way for her to visit them with our son and I could get some gaming in and meet some of y'all.  I figured she'd want to visit her grandmother more than anything, so that's how I suggested it.  She flatly declined because she reasoned that an 9 hour drive for one and a half days of vacation followed by a 9 hour drive back would be too much for our little one (he's 19 months old).  I could find no argument against that logic, so I quietly shelved my GPSE fervor.<br/><br/>Then I decided a different tact.  I asked her to come with me and her parents could watch the Lil Orkster.  I suggested that the venue would be a nice semi-camping experience, something she has enjoyed but hasn't done for a while, and she could play some laid back games with cool people.<br/><br/>She wasn't too interested at first, so I pushed for details on what didn't enthuse her.  She explained that since she gave birth, her free time has been extremely limited and gaming has lost its luster.  She was most upset about the length of time she would spend creating a character (she likes deep research on the character mindset, including finding just the right picture for the character and usually a healthy write-up) coupled with the time spent learning the rules of a new game just to watch the campaign fizzle out in a few sessions due to scheduling.  She pointed out the d20 game I tried to run with her and another couple over Skype.  It only lasted three sessions before scheduling killed it.<br/><br/>I tried to pitch her on the collaborative elements of Story Games and how quick chargen and rules teaching would be, but she was non-plussed.  I finally cajoled her into agreeing out of sheer persistence, but I swear I think she will have a good time.<br/><br/>For background, my wife and I started dating and I started running D&amp;D 2.0 for her at nearly the same time.  She was a very dedicated gamer through that campaign and even moreso during the 7 year long VtM chronicle and also during several Star Wars games.  She enjoys the escapism and playing characters that grow over time.  She's had one Story Gamey experience, a brief Dead Inside game I ran with her right before she gave birth.  She had a blast during the 8 sessions it lasted.<br/><br/>So I told you that to ask you this.  Based on the info above, what are some selling points I could use to stoke some interest for this upcoming Go Play event?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79107/#Comment_79107" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-02T11:28:22+00:00" title="July  2, 2007 11:28AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Play 1001 Nights.

As far as actual Story Games go, that one would be my main suggestion as well. You can easily sell it as telling Arabian stories together in a very spontaneous, collaborative kind of way.

However, if you used to game before, I suspect you might enjoy this, particularly with the little orkling being spoiled by doting grandparents.  If you feel like giving it a try, here are some games I think you might enjoy.  Feel free to <i>cajole</i> Mr. Ork into running these for you, not only at GPSE but before and after as well.<br/><br/>If you like <i>Dead Inside</i>, I think you might enjoy <i>The Zorcerer of Zo</i>, which is based on an ever more streamlined version of the same system.  So far, every time my husband has run it this game has won converts.  It is very light-weight and can be used to run swashbuckling, Lord of the Rings-like, or Star Wars-like adventures.  Another game based on the same system which you might enjoy is <i>Questers of the Middle Realms</i>, from Silver Branch Games.  <br/><br/>I have also had good success introducing people to story games with <i>Cat</i>, from Wicked Dead Brewery.  Other good ones include <i>InSpectres</i> from Memento Mori Theatricks, <i>Wushu</i> from Daniel Bayn, and <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>, from Clinton R. Nixon.  I also really love the game <i>Roanoke</i>, a spooky take on the lost colony using the Wushu system.  Or, if you're in the mood for westerns, you might like Ronin Arts' <i>Vs. Outlaws.</i>  Perhaps <i>Primetime Adventures</i> might also be a good choice, though I confess I find its mechanics a triffle unsatisfactory.<br/><br/>All of these games are very rules-light, which means that character creation takes five to ten minutes.  I could suggest many others, and I'm sure other people will have great suggestions too.  They also share other interesting characteristics: everything on the (very sparse) character sheet is important, and your character can be effective right from the start.<br/><br/>I hope you will feel like giving this a try, and I particularly hope you will have a great deal of fun.  With luck, in a few years you might want to teach some of these games to the li'l orkling.  :-)<br/><br/>* I rather hope Mr. Ork will have you read our responses.  :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79133/#Comment_79133" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-02T13:59:55+00:00" title="July  2, 2007  1:59PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just couldn't resist the PTA dig, eh Sophie? :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79140/#Comment_79140" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-02T14:50:48+00:00" title="July  2, 2007  2:50PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>Just couldn't resist the PTA dig, eh Sophie? :-)</blockquote>\nI'm sorry, I didn't want it to be a dig.

If she likes shopping, Pidgeon Forge and Gatlinburg are within driving distance and they have a metric shit-ton of outlet stores and such.<br/><br/>3.)

As far as I can tell, that problem's not going away even if you both agree that GPSE sounds like fun.<br/><br/>Anyway, the best advice I can offer is to lay out whatever info you've got on the games that are going to be played, drum up your best enthusiastic sales pitch for the ones she's most likely to enjoy, and see if it sparks her interest.  If it doesn't, or if it doesn't spark it enough to get her psyched about packing up the whole family for a roadtrip, then there's always next year.  Or you can offer a trade: you get a weekend to go to GPSE while she watches the kid, then she gets a weekend to go do something while you watch the kid.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79249/#Comment_79249" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T07:56:31+00:00" title="July  3, 2007  7:56AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>...I'm still trying to figure out where in this story Mrs. Orklord abandoned her (very sensible) objection to putting the 19-month-old in the car for 9 hours of driving, one-way.
