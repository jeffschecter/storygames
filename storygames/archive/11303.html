There's full info <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game" rel="nofollow">on wikipedia</a>, but the basics is it's like an RPG but not (you don't play a character or sit down) it's kind of like playing by email, especially since me having a relatively small (about 15) # of players allows me to give one on one attention if necessary.<br/><br/>The game's going to be somewhat similar to Lacuna in theme, which is pretty much my favorite RPG ever. This time though, I'm taking it live, so to speak.<br/><br/>Anyways, I thought I'd like to hear people's thoughts on the form, experiences with it, opinions on how one might do one, etc.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/d.anderson" title="d.anderson"><img alt="d.anderson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/d.anderson">d.anderson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251158/#Comment_251158" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-16T20:18:05+00:00" title="January 16, 2010  8:18PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Howdy!  I know this is not really an ARG site, but they do great work with what they call 'pervasive games', which may have some elements that are similar, or at least inspirational.  I believe there are other organizations doing these, but this is the one I know how to find without any search-fu.<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://ludocity.org/wiki/Main_Page                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251170/#Comment_251170" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-17T04:01:33+00:00" title="January 17, 2010  4:01AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would you be supporting multiple media (email, phone, mail, physical contact etc), or would be purely online? <br/><br/>I had been conscious of this as a viral marketing phenomenon it hadn't occurred to me that it would be feasible to <i>make-your-own</i> in the finest traditions of Story-Games.  <br/><br/>A 'simple' mechanic would be to send cheap, empty cellular phones (possibly numbered, in this case, from 1 to 15) to all the players with the understanding that you, the puppetmaster/control, may phone them at <i>any</i> time with a 'code' and the number of the player this information must be passed to (e.g. "La li lu le lo. Phone 13.").<br/><br/>Whether or not certain events in the A-R occur, and whether the players win, is determined by whether they can transfer this information correctly. After a set deadline control calls Phone 13, in this example, and if the owner fails to immediately repeat the correct code the mission is failed/bad A-R things happen. <br/><br/>Of course, if the players organise and form an online community then the codes can be shared swiftly and accurately. That's when you need Double-agents in their midst.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251513/#Comment_251513" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-19T22:20:30+00:00" title="January 19, 2010 10:20PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, so currently the game is ~5 days in, and so far it's sort of like a PBEM, in that the majority of the game takes place on the internet through emails as well as facebook (later other sites and methods will be added, but for now those are the channels of communication). <br/><br/>I've been progressing things at what I consider to be a fairly brisk pace of about one major communication per day. I have a lot free time at the moment, which allows me to do that although it might slow down some in the coming days- I plan on doing a progress report with the players when my tabletop group (which makes up about half the players ATM) meets on Friday. <br/><br/>So far some of the players seem to be pretty engaged, whereas a few others have taken to trolling (it's the internet, so I've written this off as an occupational hazard of the format I'm using). The last half of the players has been silent- I imagine they're just busy. Given the way it works, it should be fairly easy to pick up whenever, within certain bounds- things are only sort of in real time (in that things will happen but not super-important events in short periods of time, again, at least not now).<br/><br/>I think I may be being overly cryptic in a lot of the messages, but seeing as I'm trying to set things up as a convoluted mystery with many facets, I view this as not so much a bad thing- we'll see if I have to tone it down from losing people (I suspect this would be far less of an issue in a larger, more high budget traditional ARG, but given as I'm running this in a matter similar to a normal tabletop RPG with a corresponding lower # of players, caring what individual people think is important for the success of the game in the long run). <br/><br/>Anyways, I'm not sure if that made much sense, but it's an update anyways.<br/><br/>Still interested in hearing peoples comments, questions, criticisms, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
