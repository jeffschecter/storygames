Most of my time was spent in Games on Demand, which was packed from about mid-day on Friday through Saturday night. I missed Sunday, but I'm assuming it was just as popular that day as well. The Tabletop area was an airplane hangar full of gaming tables, 95% of which were covered in card and board games. The PAX crowd is hungry for fun and generally completely inexperienced with tabletop RPGs, a tragic wrong we tried to right. <br/><br/>So that was all I saw, with just a brief tour through the exhibit hall. I hear there were some great panels or shows. What was your PAX East experience like?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371904/#Comment_371904" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-09T08:57:29+00:00" title="April  9, 2012  8:57AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 10, 2012 12:50PM by mease19.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was only there on Friday but I had a blast.  Oddly, I enjoyed hanging out and chatting with the people around me as I waited in line for the expo to start.  I think my wife was a little grumpy about being dragged along but as soon as we got inside she was all like, "Oooh, what's this?  Hey, I want to look at that!  Can we try this?"  I got my wife squared away in a demo of Zpocalypse and sneaked over to play a demo of Mobile Frame Zero. MF0=OMG!  I'm so glad that I backed it!<br/><img alt="image" src="http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1283337_md.jpg"/><br/>I got about a half game of Murderous Ghosts in with Vx which was really fun but got cut short. The one-man Burning Wheel panel and Indie RPG panel were a blast.  I finally had a chance to pick up copies of Action Castle II, Misspent Youth, Polaris, and Burning Wheel Gold.  I was really overwhelmed by how nice everyone was.<br/><br/>[edit] While standing in line for the Indie RPG panel, I had a great conversation with a 4th year doctoral student who was working on developing bio-signatures used to detect organic material on other planets for NASA.  I love that gamers are such interesting folk!<br/><br/>[edit]  I also tried out the new Neverwinter Nights video game with the wife.  She and I really enjoy that type of game for co-op play (even though she has no interest in tabletop RPGs).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371915/#Comment_371915" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-09T10:11:26+00:00" title="April  9, 2012 10:11AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 9, 2012 10:59AM by lumpley.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The con was great, and nutso exhausting.

If the con were a week long, maybe I could do it all.<br/><br/>Between me and Meg, we sold 95% of the books we brought with us. We sold out of Apocalypse World, Dogs in the Vineyard and Murderous Ghosts, and sold Psi*Run down to 3 copies left (from about 40). PAX East is always a great show for sales.

It was an amazing panel and all of PAX people kept stopping me to tell me how much they enjoyed it!<br/><br/><br/>Lots of ups and downs but mostly ups. <br/><br/><br/>My top favorite parts of PAX:<br/><br/>1. Meeting and hanging out with Will Hindmarch.<br/>2. Spending more time with Steve Segedy. <br/>3. The "How to Start Playing D&amp;D" panel.<br/>4. Running Mouse Guard games for mostly female players.<br/>5. Running Marvel for 8-11 year old boys and girls. <br/>6. The diverse crowds. People from Russia, Canada, Korea, Japan.<br/>7. PAX attendees kept thanking us for running Games on Demand. We heard everything from, "I don't know what this is but I want it" to "how are you guys doing this, this is so amazing" to "we were playing magic but you guys were laughing and smiling and jumping around... we had to know why you were having so much fun" to "this year's PAX is better than last year because of you guys".<br/><br/><br/>There were also downs. <br/><br/>Anime Boston running at the same time as PAX took away a significant younger crowd. PAX attendance wasn't hurt and seemed bigger than last year but I felt the audience was a little older. Marvel overwhelmed GoD. It felt like we were turned into the official "learn how to play Marvel" destination which strained our GM, table, and personal financial resources (at some point I had to go buy more dice and make more copies of the materials). On Saturday we had 9 concurrent games going, all tables were filled up, and we had to turn people away. And because we were doing this out of love, we had very limited financial resources to meet the overwhelming demand. Attendees complained we didn't advertise the event, have fancy signs and banners, or provide more materials for games but meanwhile many of us were spending our own personal money to make this all happen. But on the flipside, when many attendees realized we were doing this for them, they were shocked how giving and how much work we were doing to entertain them. We even had D&amp;D DMs tell us they wanted to DM for us next year because of how friendly and close we all were. I do wish we ran more indie games. It seemed like we had to change the model from "tell us what you want to play" to "were running Dread anytime between 2-6pm, come if you are curious, even just to watch" to make room for less known games. <br/><br/>Last year, I didn't have a good time at PAX. This year, I had a good time. <br/><br/>But a lot of that good time was because people like Steve, Brennan, Terry, Will, Jim, and many others worked their asses off to make GoD happen. The weekend before PAX Terry was at a Vegetarian Convention in Austin Texas and as part of her day job she ran seminars for hundreds of people, made Tamale food samples for 200+ people, and yet\u2026 she worked harder at GoD!<br/><br/>I think right now there is a bit of a disconnect. It seems like PAX expects retailers and large companies to provide RPG entertainment in the Table Top area. Where it's GMs who bring the entertainment. Although to be fair, this is my complaint at many cons and why I try to treat the GMs at our local events as nicely as possible (and we're a non-profit). Games on Demand is starting to change this at PAX but it's because of wonderful people like Luke and Steve.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371943/#Comment_371943" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-09T12:25:27+00:00" title="April  9, 2012 12:25PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Terry working on a 6+ page document with all her observations for future PAX Games on Demand events based on talking to 300+ attendees. <br/><br/>For example, saying indie RPGs confused most people.

I wasn't there, but my impulse is to suggest that GoD may not really the best format for running games that already have a substantial footprint or a huge license to draw people in. That's why the bigger companies pay people to run games for them all day.

Some might have asked for it regardless, but we had it listed on the board and had the book on the table. It was there in front of them so we pitched it, and it's a pretty easy sell.  <br/><br/>The line that I kept telling people is that we were a group of enthusiastic volunteers there to run a selection of our favorite games. When we got tired of running something, the solution was to stop offering it, which is (I think, I wasn't there on Sunday) what we did. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

At one point two young guys came up and when asked said they'd never played any RPGs before. I told them "You're exactly why we're here!" and hooked them up with Jonathan Hastings and <i>Zombie Cinema</i>, which they loved.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372015/#Comment_372015" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-09T18:10:40+00:00" title="April  9, 2012  6:10PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            God damn, I love you folks!<br/><br/>Steve: You're the best front man for 'this thing of ours' I've ever met; no doubt you held down the fort.

The problem was that these weren't full groups. You would have a table open for 6 people and 3 people would show up who absolutely only wanted Marvel and 3 people who were interested in a wide variety of games. So by default, Marvel was run because half the people were inflexible and half who were interested in games like Apocalypse World were willing to be flexible. <br/><br/>There were also a lot of people who showed up when games were full. Many of them wanted a variety of games and we did our best to accommodate them later if possible. <br/><br/>I decided on Sunday that I simply wouldn't run any more Marvel and crossed it off my list of potential games. Which meant a few Marvel players didn't get to play but I was able to run Psi*Run twice and more Mouse Guard. <br/><br/>I should add that almost all the Marvel games were absolutely amazing. It's an incredibly easy game to demo. I have it almost down to a science and you can run for 15 minutes or hours with players dropping in and out as needed. <br/><br/>Fiasco was incredibly popular (if not the most popular game, at least the second most popular) but without Steve, there would have been no Games on Demand. Steve was so giving and supportive it made me incredibly happy and enthused to support him as much as possible. If it wasn't for Steve, I wouldn't have been at PAX. And while games like Burning Wheel and Mouse Guard were also very popular, Luke came by several times to do what he could to support people supporting him. It was a love fest to say the least! <br/><br/>During the 500 person "How to Start Playing D&amp;D" panel at least twice I answered that the best way to get comfortable running games is to start by playing Fiasco. I saw one of the Wizards of the Coast employees write down "learn about Fiasco" in their note book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372035/#Comment_372035" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-09T19:36:39+00:00" title="April  9, 2012  7:36PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>Steve: You're the best front man for 'this thing of ours' I've ever met; no doubt you held down the fort.

I didn't get to actually run 3:16, for instance, but since a game of it got going as I was leaving, I left behind my rulebook, all my sheets and trooper standees and they got used. Will and Steve buying me drinks on Saturday evened that out.<br/><br/>I think it's safe to say Fiasco was actually our most-requested and most-run game, with Marvel a reasonably close second. Steve speaks the truth: we just put up whatever anyone said they were willing to run, so we got a full range of stuff including more 'trad' stuff like Marvel, CthulhuTech, and Eclipse Phase, to the definitively-Indie; my 2.5 hour demo of Apocalypse World went off on Sunday to an enthusiastic response.<br/><br/>I think that it's worth remembering that PAX is a bit of a different beast than GneCon or Origins: we did not emphasize 'Indie' Games on Demand, and I think that's the right way to go for that crowd. At GenCon or Origins, it makes sense to aggressively brand what we're doing as cutting-edge and outside the normal range of what people expect. At PAX, everything is new to most everyone, and we also needed every GM we could get once things started heating up, so as John says, we can emphasize certain games, but I think it'd make little sense to turn away effective ambassadors for gaming because they're not passing the Indie Litmus Test. The devil's advocate argument I'd make is that if people are really just interested in Marvel, it's better that one of us teaches it to them, so that if they have fun at our games, maybe they come back next year and go "We had fun in that guy's game, what's he running this year?" and we can ease them into some of the more adventurous Story Game content.<br/><br/>On a personal note, it was great to see everyone, and I met a bunch of people I hope to get a chance to play with in the future. Will and Steve and John and Terry and everyone else, thanks!<br/><br/>(And, if anyone reading all of this is jealous and wants in, it's never too late to stop by and see us at Origins this year, even if just to say hello!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/LincolnSmash" title="LincolnSmash"><img alt="LincolnSmash" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/LincolnSmash">LincolnSmash</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372046/#Comment_372046" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-09T21:00:19+00:00" title="April  9, 2012  9:00PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 9, 2012 9:05PM by LincolnSmash.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Loved the tabletop panels -- I got to sit in on the "what are indie RPGs" panel and Luke's D&amp;D panel, and both were really cool.

The 10-year old interrupted my admittedly not-very-smooth pitch for "soft" Fiasco and told me "one of us" should have made a game about Sun Tzu (as he had just finished reading "The Art of War"). He then started to explain to me exactly what that game would look like, at which point I suggested we all sit down at one of our tables and try to design the game. It was fun! He very quickly decided that you needed to be able to play generals from ALL eras ("Caesar, Charlemagne, and Patton!) and was very admamant that the game be as realistic as possible. He ended up deciding it should really be two games, though: an ancient version and a modern version that would be sold separately, but that would be based on the same system so that Patton could go back in time and fight Caesar. (Among the rules he was sure his game needed: "you get +2 to your strength if you have the high ground".)<br/><br/>My PAX East, in general:<br/><br/>This was my first time at PAX. I spent most of my time running stuff at Games on Demand (much thanks to Steve, John, and Terry for helping make this all happen). I was mostly overwhelmed by my few forays into the video game expo area. But I was psyched by everything that was going on in the tabletop hall. It was just great to see so much enthusiasm for playing tons of different games with tons of different people. I'm more used to the vibe at comic book conventions, which feel a lot less social and much more focused on commerce. (Even the retail booths in the tabletop area at PAX seemed as much focused on selling/providing/supporting a social experience as they did on selling a product.) By the end of the weekend I was simultaneously (a) a bit worn out and loopy from all the games I had run/played and (b) wanting more time to play more games.<br/><br/>I was glad to be there with a purpose/job/etc., because without it I might have ended up overwhelmed and wandering around aimlessly, but I do wish I had been able to go to some of the panels. Still, I met lots of cool people with whom I had lots of fun talking about all sorts of games. It was especially meaningful to me that I got to introduce a bunch of people to RPGs/story-games, and was told (a bunch of times) that they didn't know RPGs were this much fun. A couple of times a new player would start the game telling me that they weren't good at telling stories or that they could never act stuff out in character, but by the end they were completely caught up in it. Overall, a great weekend!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372087/#Comment_372087" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-10T07:51:59+00:00" title="April 10, 2012  7:51AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jim Crocker</cite>I think that it's worth remembering that PAX is a bit of a different beast than GenCon or Origins: we did not emphasize 'Indie' Games on Demand, and I think that's the right way to go for that crowd.

Our space is really different in Seattle (much smaller, off to the side rather than central), the crowd in Seattle is more likely to have played some tabletop RPGs (not surprising, with all the game companies here), and we're very much branded as "indie" RPGs rather than just any games you want.  That's partially why I'm asking questions, is to get a sense of how different the experiences are.

Our space is really different in Seattle (much smaller, off to the side rather than central), the crowd in Seattle is more likely to have played some tabletop RPGs (not surprising, with all the game companies here), and we're very much branded as "indie" RPGs rather than just any games you want.  That's partially why I'm asking questions, is to get a sense of how different the experiences are. It's much harder in Seattle to reach out to general convention goers, outside of the big panels.<br/><br/>Actually, my experience with the PAX East crowd is that they totally get and are really interested in things that are "indie."

I was talking to Joshua about this, about how I'd been carefully wording myself, and he pointed out that the confusion was probably productive and he willfully engendered it. If they make a presumption that you have to correct, you're stickier in the brain because you're an outlier from their expectations. I think I'm going to try that going forward, if the context is right.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: CamBanks</cite>I have to say I was astonished at the Marvel thing.</blockquote>\n<i>Marvel RPG</i> is the only game I played all weekend (other than running a short demo of my game). I had quite a bit of fun in it, though I'm not sure I full idea of what it could do, since we had players dropping in and out throughout it. It made it into a bit of a computer game in a way, but we still had fun and I can see the potential there. The mechanics interact with each other in interesting ways I want to understand better.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Steve Segedy</cite>At one point two young guys came up and when asked said they'd never played any RPGs before.

I was at the Indie Bazaar booth watching Meguey Baker explain what roleplaying was to someone who'd never even heard of it before, then transitioned into a conversation with a guy who also hadn't, was older (in his 60s I'd say), and he suddenly got excited when he flipped through the books, "We things like this in school! Fiction games, we called them!" He proceeded to pick up a bunch of books and I had the sense from our conversation that he already he wanted to design!<br/><br/>There're a few key pieces there, not only are they people who've never played RPGs, but they're willing to try it for the first time at a convention with weirdo games. In my experience, you don't get that kind of openness to new things at most conventions.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>I did two panels and they were a ton of fun.

They were both amazing and possibly one of the coolest families I've met let alone gamed with.<br/></blockquote>\nI had the privilege of running a follow on session of Marvel for this same Father/Daughter team. Probably the highlight of the show for me. The way she and her father were such a great TEAM together just melted my heart. I had come over to the booth, looking to play something, and was ready to play The Shab Al-Hiri Roach, when they came along looking to play Marvel again. As a father of three girls, 2 of which are budding gamers themselves (my 6 year old is some kind of evil tactical genius in Smallworld) I was powerless to resist. I said, lets do it, and am so happy that I did. <br/><br/>I ran at least 3 sessions of Marvel I think, as well as an impromptu Leverage game for a group that wanted to play Bulldogs, but Brennan was running something else (Nice dose of Irony there). I only had Leverage, Marvel, and Fiasco ready to go, with a great big reach up my butt to pull off Dresden, so I was happy with them agreeing to Leverage. None of them were RPG players, and only 1 had seen the TV show before. It went off very well, and I think they all had a great time, especially as their big revenge plot came closer to fruition.<br/><br/>This was my first convention GM'ing with you all, and I want to thank you for what you do. I expect to continue supporting you, and actually plan on doing all of my DMing at the GoD room this summer at Gencon. With that said, I'd like to offer up some comments on the value I think GoD brings to gaming at cons. By providing the drop in options, and such freedom in game running, a GM like myself, who has a wide range of games that I like to play and run, I am able to set that up without having to plan them out ahead of time, and also to worry about not enough people coming to an event. By running it as available, it makes my personal "con life" SO much better. When it comes to game selection, I would encourage the management of GoD, as it were, to be flexible in the definition of Indie games, as far as what's allowed or welcomed in the room. While I completely sympathize with the desire to not have yet another room full of D&amp;D (and I dont want it either) I would hate to see a hard restriction put down to ONLY "Indie" games. Unfortunately, I can also see how just having a big name up on the board will have an effect at driving people to play it over other games that are equally worthy of game time.<br/><br/>I guess it leads me to wonder, what is the mission of GoD? Is there a specific goal to promote indie games, or is it to promote RP in general, in an on demand way? For me, I dont WANT to run D&amp;D at GoD. I feel like theres definitely a better place for it elsewhere at a con, but what else should be excluded?<br/><br/>Lastly, I really want to thank whoever was running the front desk. Terry, I think, and Steve, for making me feel very welcome as a GM. It definitely makes me want to keep doing it, and doing it with you guys.

We've never had to be super restructive about what games people ran, I don't think, because (1) it was mostly indie stuff, (2) there's typically enough space, and (3) defining "indie" is tough and often stupid. Mouse Guard is just as troublesome as Marvel in that regard, right? I agree that it's one of the best formats for running ANY game, and somebody should definitely run pick-up D&amp;D that way for folks new to the hobby, for sure. But if GoD stops being the go-to place for running and playing indie games, because they're overwhelmed by other stuff, then indie games will have to do something else. That's fine, things adapt and change, and we're nothing if not flexible, but it's good to be aware and intentional about such changes, as much as possible. That's my only concern here.

Really stunning to see. As usual, getting to meet and listen to people (neither of which I did enough of) was the highlight of the show. Thanks, y'all.<br/><br/>I facilitated <i>only</i> Fiasco (plus one short session of Always/Never/Now) over the whole weekend. At one point, I facilitated two simultaneous Fiasco game (which is less than half of my record, now that I think about it). My schedule went haywire at the last minute, so I spent more time explaining GoD, explaining games, and trying to match players to tables (or to Steve, Terry, Jim, and John's expertise) than anything else.<br/><br/>Besides Games On Demand and fun duties as a demo fellow and a dev for Dragon Age, I saw almost none of the show save the Kickstarter Arcade room, which was wonderfully enthusiastic and varied. (Jeremy Keller ran a Technoir demo for a mighty big group in there, at one point.) <br/><br/>It was a wonderful show that I hope to visit again, but smarter, and harder, and smarter.<br/><br/><b>Edit:</b> There were lots of people around GoD that I didn't get to meet properly (my fault) and who helped to make it a wicked-awesome experience, by the way.

Walking in and out of the same rooms, saving games unnecessarily, forgetting what we had in inventory; if it had been Death Frost Doom and not Spooky Manor, we would've been fucked. Eventually, I pulled out a notebook and started mapping - people were passing the shared map around. Over the course of two remarkably quiet hours, we mastered the "dungeon" together. It was subdued, but still cool - the map became an anchor that focused the group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372426/#Comment_372426" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-11T13:50:54+00:00" title="April 11, 2012  1:50PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PAX East also went like this: <a href="http://gameplaywright.net/2012/04/hush/" rel="nofollow">Jared Sorensen ran a near-silent Parsely game.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
