What about it inspires this, and where do you want the rules to go?<br/><br/>(This is pretty patently a pull at Malcolm to talk about <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/880608" rel="nofollow">Budo</a>.)<br/><br/>Personally: I come back to attempting various Wushu remixes, because it's great at supporting people to initially run free at describing great action sequences; but then, I find myself wanting some other rules to help players entertain each other even more (i.e. make those descriptions better), basically to take it to the next level.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95664/#Comment_95664" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-13T16:20:20+00:00" title="September 13, 2007  4:20PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great timing, I just bought Budo today!  <br/><br/>I've been tinkering for a couple years now with ideas for a Wushu-based "god game" where the characters are small-time gods and demigods.  Inspirations include <span style="text-decoration: underline;">American Gods</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dogma</span>, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Prophecy.</span>  Gaming influences include Nobilis and Unknown Armies.  Why I like the Wushu system for this is that the system is fairly simple and abstract, but capable of rather different play experiences given small rules tweaks and a strongly defined setting.  <br/><br/>I'd really like to see someone incorporate personality mechanics into Wushu.  There's a rudimentary Honor stat in Wire-Fu, if I recall correctly, but I'd like to see a game where personality mechanics are hooked right into the Wushu engine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95707/#Comment_95707" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-13T18:35:51+00:00" title="September 13, 2007  6:35PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 13, 2007 6:36PM by Malcolm Sheppard.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bwuh?<br/><br/>Basically, I really liked Wushu but I wanted to moderate the freewheeling feeling with some of the character-centered aspects of Japan's cinematic martial arts and traditions. I also wanted a system with characters that were a bit less "disposable" and viable across a long term.<br/><br/>In koryu bugei (old form martial arts) specific skills are actually pretty rigidly defined. In some cases you have arts that only do one thing, like attacking with a drawn sword in a standing position (battojutsu/battodo). In others you have detailed subskills in a larger tradition. For example, in the Tenshin Shoden Katori Shinto Ryu they teach almost *everything*, but few people really know it all and seniors typically consult densho (notes about a particular practice) to make sure they don't forget specifics. In anime and more fantastic period pics you have characters with different specialties. I pop example would be Naruto (though I'm not a big fan of it). Characters are very "RPG-like" in that they have consistent, specific talents from episode to episode unlike, say wuxia, where you lean about a talent after the fact. I wanted more stuff like that.<br/><br/>I also wanted the play experience to be a bit more "coldbloodded" and mechanics centered. But despite all of these interests I didn't want to get rid of Wushu's essential charm go too far in any direction. I think one of the problems with recent thought in game design is that it tends to extremes. If you have a design agenda where system's in the middle there's a tendency to go for heavy or rigid rules when all you want to do is turn the dial a bit. Budo turns the dial in a more system-heavy, sustained play direction, but then it *stops* at a certain point, where I want it to be.<br/><br/>I've thought of taking the Budo rules and using a future iteration for one of the games I have percolating in the back of my head, but right now building <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/1137037" rel="nofollow">Aeternal Legends</a> is the big thing -- and working on KotHS . . . and WW stuff                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
