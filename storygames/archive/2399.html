                    So I've been thinking about <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2376" rel="nofollow">Troy</a> and <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2395" rel="nofollow">Tony</a>'s recent threads.<br/><br/>It seems to me that both threads (at least in their titles) purport to be about making a general thing (frex: religion, history) a more interesting subject for roleplaying, but in fact the original authors of the thread are interested in a really specific kind of help related to something they're working on.  I don't think either Troy or Tony were attempting to be intentionally misleading, attracting people to a thread supposedly about open brainstorming, and Troy was nice enough to let us have a neat conversation about religion in roleplaying despite the fact that it wasn't really what he wanted.  But I guess I like the awesome-o-fy threads because they could be an opportunity to bring the collective creativity of SG to bear on making roleplaying better or more interesting.<br/><br/>If people want us to help awesome-o-fy their games or specific ideas that they have, that's cool.  But honestly, I kinda hope they'd do it in a thread that was labeled as such, instead of one with such an open-ended title.  A thread about lasersharking history would be cool.  But a thread about making history cooler without lasersharking it would be neat as well.  John Kim's right that there's certainly more than one way to awesome-o-fy history, and it'd be nice to discuss those.<br/><br/>So, yeah.  I guess I'm just hoping that we could do some better labeling and thread introductions when it comes to making it clear what kind of responses you're hoping to get.  Are you really opening up discussion on a topic?  Or are you really asking for a specific kind of response?  The latter is cool, but I suspect that the former might be more interesting, leading you to things that you might not have anticipated.                </div>

<p>Well said. Pursuant to that, once we recognize what a thread starter's intent is, can we try and defer to that intent, rather than pulling off the thread in another direction?</p>
<p>I think I agree with Jonathan that open brainstorming is better in general, but if someone asks us, "Let's talk about this thing," then let's talk about that.</p>

                            For the record, my thread really was just meant to be "let's all have some fun lasersharking history". However, because I used the term "awesome-o-fy", people took it to mean I was saying "history sucks, lets fix it". In my thread I actually provided an example of what I wanted to do and said "now it's your turn", which I thought was pretty clear. Maybe if I'd thought of the term "lasersharking", there wouldn't have been any confusion. I really was not asking for help with any particular problem when I started my thread.<br/><br/>But if people want to talk about what "awesome-o-fy" means, I think that would be a useful discussion.                        </div>

                            I guess I had certainly gotten the impression, based on previous threads in this vein, that "awesome-o-fy" contained an implication that the topic at hand was <i>almost cool</i> in its original form, but just <i>wasn't</i> -- it wasn't quite firing on all cylinders, some great concepts got bogged down by some other crap -- so let's "fix" it. There's an element of running the topic work down involved, but only to the extent that we're interested in using it as a creative springboard to something better.<br/><br/>The creative goodness that's come out of some of the prior incarnations has probably made it a popular format to replicate, but I've quietly had misgivings about its increasing ubiquity around here, precisely because of the implication that whatever's being discussed was "obviously" shit to begin with. (Not waving my finger at Tony or anybody, just mentioning it because Jonathan's asking.) I think we've probably already done all the "safe" whipping boys, but I guess I'd be okay if the whole format just mutated into something without the negative connotation.                        </div>

                            Tony, yeah, I not meaning to pick on you, I'm just suffering a little confusion over the past couple threads.<br/><br/>Good call, Larry.  Maybe what I'm suggesting would be better as threads like:<br/><br/>-- Ways of Handling Pre-Established Setting<br/>-- Alternatives to One-PC-Per-Player<br/>-- How to Make RPG Magic More Like the Occult<br/><br/>I mean "awesome-o-fy" started as a mild mocking of RPGnet threads to begin with, so maybe asking it to serve as a method of serious discussion is a little much.                        </div>

                            Before folks start throwing chairs, I just want to say that I'm all over the idea of coming up with new thread-title memes or conventions. <br/><br/>The Awesome-O-Fy, in its original (whattevah) context was just a way to say "Hey, here's an old AD&amp;D (or other) game setting. Let's do to it what they did to Battlestar Galactica" (which was "Make it undeniably more awesome in many new ways than it originally was). In fact, I'd love to see more settings get the Treatment. L5R, Tribe 8, Blue Planet, etc.<br/><br/>But again, meanings change. If someone wants to do something else and call it "Awesome-O-Fy X" or "X Gets the Battlestar Galactica Treatment", that's cool with me, but it might be more interesting or helpful to come up with a more accurate way of describing what you want.<br/><br/>Either way, I dig the threads on history and polytheism that are developing (just reading them now, was out all last week).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

<p>I'm glad Andy brought up the BSG bit. That's what I remember the earliest "awesome-o-fy" threads being about: remaking an old setting in the same way that Sci-Fi Channel remade BSG, by stripping out the fluff and turning other details into central elements of the show's theme. The original BSG used conflict with the Cylons, a sneak attack, and myths about a 13th tribe to set up a "Wagon Train in space", then treated those details as a mere gimmick; the new BSG picked those elements out and focused on them to create central themes about interracial (interspecies) conflict, treason, and religion.</p>
<p>I've seen some slight tendency towards lasersharking in even the early threads, which may point to a fundamental disagreement about what it means to awesome-o-fy something. What I would like to see is more BSG-like awesome-o-fying: take just a few throwaway details from an old RPG setting and discovering what kind of interlocked themes you could build from that. The problem with lasersharking, other than the fact that it gets out of hand, is that it's just a gimmick, just like that stuff in the old BSG.</p>
<p>Take the history thread. "Awesome-o-fy history" to me doesn't mean lasersharking George Washington so that he can grow to thirty times his own size and fight the British singlehanded; it would mean taking a few minor elements like the myth about the cherry tree/"I cannot tell a lie" and his refusal to accept a nomination as king and trying to combine those into some kind of theme, something about the conflict of honesty and power. Any unnatural/nonhistorical details added should serve that theme; maybe the Freemasons teach pseudopsi powers of detecting lies and hiding reactions, and the game becomes one of rebels banding together to fight for freedom, but none are sure which of their brethren may actually be lying about it...</p>
<p>You could even treat this as a Game Chef-like challenge: pick one game setting, let everyone find one or two elements in the setting to focus on and develop a theme around.</p>
