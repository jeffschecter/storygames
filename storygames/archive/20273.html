It was fun and useful to me, and I owe it my games from Dogs in the Vineyard to Apocalypse World, but rpg design has left it behind. <br/><br/>Among many others, but most particularly, I don't think that the idea of Creative Agendas stands up after all, let alone G, N, and S as its representatives.<br/><br/>We used to think that RPGs were one game. In, like, the 90s or whenever. We would say things like "what is the object of a RPG?" as though all RPGs would have the same one.<br/><br/>GNS was a real step forward: "RPGs aren't one game, they're THREE!"<br/><br/>But, of course, RPGs aren't three games either. Every RPG, like every other kind of game, is its own. You can taxonomize them if you want, but then you're constructing artificial categories and cramming games into them, not learning or finding out something true about the games themselves.<br/><br/>Just so you know!<br/><br/>-Vincent                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446802/#Comment_446802" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-17T01:15:05+00:00" title="July 17, 2015  1:15AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446804/#Comment_446804" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-17T01:52:25+00:00" title="July 17, 2015  1:52AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Vincent.

As Rob says, vocabulary - and the underlying mental analytic vocabulary enables - is what you get from the incessant modeling of complex behaviours. For me rpg theory, Big Model and GNS and whatever, is comparable to e.g. military science, which despite the lofty name, is in the exact same place with rpg theory in attempting to model, analyze and predict complex human phenomena with infinite variation. One could condemn both for coming in the way of natural intuitive understanding, but it's probably better to take them both as what they are - tools of mental construction, to achieve better ways to [kill people] / [play games].                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446835/#Comment_446835" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-17T11:56:38+00:00" title="July 17, 2015 11:56AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm on board with the new school of objects, strategy, style, dice &amp; above all clouds!!! <i>Take me to the skies folks!</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446836/#Comment_446836" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-17T11:56:41+00:00" title="July 17, 2015 11:56AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not condemning the Big Model for coming in the way of natural intuitive understanding, for goodness sake.

And the same thing with FitM vs FatE? And the same thing with Effectiveness, Resource, and Positioning? They're convenient stand-ins for what's actually going on, when what's actually going on defies such simplistic taxonomies?<br/><br/>Same thing with GNS.<br/><br/>I was developing the idea of technical agenda as the technical component of creative agenda, and the further I developed it, the more patent it became to me that G, N and S were arbitrary, not reflective of real divisions in actual design or actual play. That while you can, if you want, assign a given instance of gameplay to G, N or S more or less consistently, you do so by asserting false similarities and ignoring some true similarities between other instances of gameplay. GNS is a convenient stand-in for what's actually going on.<br/><br/>If any of you Big Model theorists want to check my work, I'll be happy to lay it out for you, but it's long and it's technical, and I'll ask you to follow along carefully.

No one posts about what I think or what I said, so I can speak more freely from a "non-partisan" position, and people online don't particularly feel the need to take sides based on anything I said.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446881/#Comment_446881" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-17T17:59:10+00:00" title="July 17, 2015  5:59PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2015 6:00PM by lumpley.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Alex:</b> Whatever.

You say that games are not designed for Creative Agenda, which I agree has historically often been the case. Are you also implying that because games have not been created with Creative Agenda in mind, purposeful, agenda-full play is also impossible or so rare as to make no difference?<br/><br/>I assume you do not hold an entirely nihilistic view on the matter of purposeful play, so surely you're calling it something if not Creative Agenda...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446884/#Comment_446884" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-17T18:16:58+00:00" title="July 17, 2015  6:16PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2015 6:34PM by lumpley.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Eero:</b> I don't mind, but it's long and technical, and Story Games is not and never has been, right?

These days, it's pretty widespread, and only getting moreso. <br/><br/>The idea of creative agendas is a stab at identifying how purposeful play happens and what it means, but from a point of view of scarcity, of longing, of failure. Now that we have abundant, reliable purposeful play, we don't have to long for it or obsessively diagnose what went wrong. We can actually dig into it and learn how it works instead. <br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446889/#Comment_446889" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-17T18:52:22+00:00" title="July 17, 2015  6:52PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Ricardo</b>: Sure.

Agenda instead of just recontextualizing it. I guess it's just that you find it easier to consider purposeful play without all the baggage of the [infinity-1] discussions of "that's not what Creative Agenda means", in which case fair enough. I know that my own theoretical concerns have largely shifted exactly like you describe, from problem identification to positive construction, even if I've found the concept of Creative Agenda to serve well for the latter purpose as well.<br/><br/>I guess that what makes the most sense in this regard depends in part on how much of an artistic manifesto one considers the legacy of Forge theory to be, and how much of an analytical description of what roleplaying necessarily is. Its former role is quite easy to deprecate as design moves on, exactly as Vincent says.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446894/#Comment_446894" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-17T19:16:27+00:00" title="July 17, 2015  7:16PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>And the same thing with FitM vs FatE?</blockquote>\nThis refers to "Fortune in the Middle"  and "Fortune at the End" for any lurkers here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446903/#Comment_446903" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-17T21:27:50+00:00" title="July 17, 2015  9:27PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2015 9:28PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like theories and models and specialized terminology.

The best that I can see coming from it is a checklist (don't forget any of these points).<br/><br/>GNS, like most models, had something to be said for it. It was wrong, but it did highlight something and usefulness came out of it. It's about as right as the Mercator Projection (and that thing needs to be binned or at least dropped to historical uses) or possibly even Ptolomaic Crystal Spheres - but we steered ships using both those. GNS allowed us to see things going forward - and some of the things it allowed us to see were its own massive shortcomings.<br/><br/>But to truly get rid of GNS we need something to replace it with as a vision.

To ignore the Forge discussion of Techniques (IIEE, stance, etc.) is to ignore the best work of Big Model theory. I certainly used it in the design of my own games (none published).<br/><br/>To say "RPGs are more than just the rules of the game" is a straw man. Big Model theory said this a decade ago, and said it loudly and often. I'm not sure why you are implying that it's somehow a failing of the Big Model.<br/><br/>I agree that Forge theory didn't focus much on campaign management, and I think it's a fertile area for more research! However, I think Forge theory built a pretty solid foundation to build that on. I'd look at discussions about character positioning, authority, and GM roles for starters.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447057/#Comment_447057" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-20T21:41:21+00:00" title="July 20, 2015  9:41PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well I believe I called it in <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?476792-GNS-RIP&amp;s=755f01879ff2b5beda26db9b744a084a" rel="nofollow">2009</a> :-)<br/><br/>Of course, my own ideas have moved on since 2009. A Hell of a lot. And I'm probably calmer about it too, possibly something to do with being older and presumably having less testosterone.<br/><br/>But I don't think that the real problem with GNS was that it involved taxonomy. Sure, a taxonomical scheme will always struggle to capture the vastness of the human experience (and a Hell of a lot of the human experience can enter into RPGs). But without an effort to simplify concepts and categories, without mental short-cuts, without boiling the things we observe down to their most basic versions, we can't even formulate general statements for guidance, let alone apply them and learn. So everything becomes trial and error, instinct, preconceptions, tradition. Now often those haphazard learning methods may surpass theoretically informed efforts in their result, but if we want the best from our games, we should probably try both.<br/><br/>So if the problem with GNS wasn't that it involved taxonomy, what was it? I believe it was what it became, in people's minds. I believe there are actually people I have met who have been totally put off some styles of game by the prejudices that they have built up in response to GNS. People who have closed their minds off entirely to the fun they might have with things that fit into category X, just because they've heard bad things about category X, or because there have been some games that fit category X which they haven't enjoyed, and they attribute that to their Xness, and not to some other quality which might better explain their non-enjoyment. And that closing off of minds makes me sad. Especially when it means some people close their minds off from the stuff I personally prefer.<br/><br/>I don't think this has affected a large proportion even of avid roleplayers/storygamers, but I think it has affected a few people I personally have met, because of the circles I move in, and it has impacted on my life personally, and as I say, it makes me sad.<br/><br/>So I'm glad to see V.B. moving away from the rigid theoretical models of the Forge and adopting a more analogue outlook for the time being. If that means more people shaking themselves loose of the shackles of GNS, that's great. But I can't help wondering with a hint of cynicism where exactly all this is headed now, as far as V.B. is concerned.<br/><br/>On the other hand I think there's still room for progress in a theoretical understanding of RPGs and storygames. What I would say though is that people should try looking at them from some totally different angle, not related at all to the sorts of categories Forge theory was primarily interested in. My money's on proper academic psychology being the best place to start looking if you want to be able to say something truly meaningful about RPGs. For instance, how does the capacity for empathy (affective or cognitive) affect a person's enjoyment of RPGs, what they look for in an RPG, how they behave during an RPG, etc.? But that's another thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447059/#Comment_447059" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-20T22:07:01+00:00" title="July 20, 2015 10:07PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice post, <a href="/forums/profile/omnifray">@omnifray</a>.

RPGs are more than just the rules of the game which is not the game for board/war games.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>This is the second or third time I've seen you say this, and I think the first part just isn't true (about game design)</blockquote>\nNot in game design but it true in the case of the design of tabletop RPGs. <br/><br/>Every game I read and played where the author was inspired by the Big Theory, GNS, etc  read and played like what would be a focused scenario for a traditional RPG. So focused that it might as well been a war/board game as I couldn't tell diffence other than the fact it was focused on individual characters.<br/><br/>It is a fallacy to assume that if a games focuses on or is about individual characters that it is a RPG. SPI's Lord of the Ring and Freedom in the Galaxy had mechanics for individual character. Enough that I had friends who  used them to run tabletop RPG campaigns. So why aren't they considered tabletop RPGs? Because the rest of the game's mechanics to make a lot of decision as a player of the game, not as a particular character. A lot of games I see inspired by GNS/Tabletop are exactly the same way except they don't bolt on a traditional wargame. <br/>\n<blockquote>and the second part implies something that the Big Model isn't saying.</blockquote>\n<br/>It is a criticism of how I see Big Model/GNS game theory applied. P\n<blockquote>I know that The Big Model and associated theory was used in the design of at least a few RPGs (Nathan Paoletta's <i>carry</i> and <i>Annalise</i>, to name two). To ignore the Forge discussion of Techniques (IIEE, stance, etc.) is to ignore the best work of Big Model theory. I certainly used it in the design of my own games (none published).</blockquote>\nThe games I am talking about, the problem is that they may be good games, but they are not good RPGs. Why? Because they focus to much on players making decision as player rather than as their character. In short, they have too much meta-gaming. And like Euro-games they are better off establishing their own niche rather saddling themselves with the expectations of RPGs. <br/><br/><br/>To say "RPGs are more than just the rules of the game" is a straw man. Big Model theory said this a decade ago, and said it loudly and often. I'm not sure why you are implying that it's somehow a failing of the Big Model.</blockquote>\nWhere the Big Model failed is that people tried to write "more than the just rules" part into the rules. Like making Social Contract part of the game and its mechanics when it is a meta-game issue. Players acting as their character is about agency. The freedom for players to act as their character would in whatever situation they find themselves and not to be beholding to some rule telling them otherwise. \n<blockquote>I agree that Forge theory didn't focus much on campaign management, and I think it's a fertile area for more research! However, I think Forge theory built a pretty solid foundation to build that on. I'd look at discussions about character positioning, authority, and GM roles for starters. </blockquote>\nIn my view it is simple. In tabletop RPGs the gamemaster is a referee there to adjudicate the actions of the players acting as their characters. A referee because players as their characters are not omni-sentient when it comes to the setting. A player only know as much as his character knows, can only do what his character can do in the setting of the campaign, anything else is meta-gaming. THe more meta-gaming you have, the more the game is about the players do rather than what the players do as their characters. Too much meta-game mechanics then it becomes a war/board game focused on individual characters not tabletop roleplaying. <br/><br/>The games I seen inspired by the Big Model have too much meta-game mechanics baked into their design.<br/><br/>One point of the rules is to help the players act as if they are really there as their characters, mostly by making the potential consequences of their actions understandable. Another point of the rules is make as adjudication as easy as possible given the desired level of detail for the campaign.<br/><br/>The issues raised by stances, creative agenda, etc is really one of sportmanship. In sports especially team sports a coach and/or players need to come together as a team to accomplish the goal of wining the game. The more and traditions are called sportmanship. There are things you do to make this happen and there are thing you can do that will make it all fall apart. <br/><br/>In traditional tabletop roleplaying, sportsmanship is about being part of a group of players sharing a pen &amp; paper virtual reality. Like sports there are things that can be done to help this and things that people do will cause it to fall apart. RPG Sportmanship is all meta-gaming. Stuff that has be dealt with the players as players and not part of the action of the campaign. Where the Big Model goes wrong is that designers using it attempt to take many of the issue involved in good sportmanship and attempt to weld it into the mechanics of their games. <br/><br/>The difference RPG Sportmanship and the Social Contract is that Sportmanship is separate from any activity related to the playing or running of the campaign. RPG Showmanship is an expectation that each players sitting down at the table will act as mature responsible individuals. That it not something special and unique to RPGs in the way the Social Contract is presented but is simply what works for dozens of other types of activities where small groups of people have to cooperate towards a common goal. Rules can't fix players who display poor sportmanship. <br/><br/>I chose to use sportmanship because out of all the different ways of handling small group dynamics it has the most applicable techniques in handling both cooperation and competition in small groups. <br/><br/>My alternative to the current body of RPG Theory is this. <br/><br/>Tabletop RPGs are about the experience not the game. The experience being doing something interesting and fun in a setting as an imagined character. RPG Theory works when it helps players and referee how to craft a better experience. <br/><br/>That an important parallel is cherry-picking useful information from what know in forming and maintaining small groups of people together in a leisure activity. But with the understanding that it is a preregister to play like having a roof, a bathroom, and adequate heating or cooling. It not the point of playing a RPG Campaign.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447096/#Comment_447096" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-21T14:47:43+00:00" title="July 21, 2015  2:47PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there are some broken blockquotes there, Robert.

Sometimes he phrased it as the game design lending themselves to certain modes of play, but often it would just directly associate. For example, below is his description of the "High Concept" subcategory of GNS Simulationism ( from <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/articles/15/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/articles/15/</a> )\n<blockquote>This sort of game design will be familiar to almost anyone, represented by Arrowflight (Setting), Pax Draconis (Setting), Godlike (Setting), Sun &amp; Storm (Setting + Situation), Dreamwalker (Situation), The Godsend Agenda (Character-Setting tug-of-war), The Collectors (applied Fudge, Situation + Character), Heartquest (applied Fudge; Character), Children of the Sun (Setting), Fvlminata (Setting), and Dread (Situation + Character), Fading Suns (Setting), Earthdawn (Setting), Space: 1889 (Setting), Mutant Chronicles (Setting), Mage first edition (Character), Mage second edition (Setting), Ironclaw (Setting), and Continuum (Setting with a touch of System). Many Fantasy Heartbreakers fall into this category, almost all Setting-based. Some of the best-known games of this type include Tekumel, Jorune, Traveller (specifically in its mid-80s through mid-90s form), Call of Cthulhu, Pendragon, Nephilim, Feng Shui, the various secondary settings for AD&amp;D2 like Al-Qadim, and quite a few D20 or WEG games which rely on licensing. I am coming to think of D20 as a kind of High Concept chassis, a very new and interesting development in RPG design. <br/><br/>Also, most incoherent game designs are partly or even primarily High Concept Simulationist as well, with AD&amp;D2 and Vampire (first edition) as the best-known examples. </blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447250/#Comment_447250" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-26T17:49:29+00:00" title="July 26, 2015  5:49PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aren't all models convenient stand ins for what's actually going on.

He had the setting figured out, and needed help with designing the hard rules. His idea was to play it with a specific group in mind, not to publish it or whatever. He also has a story in his head, parallel to the events in the game, that intersects with it sometimes but is pretty much stand alone.<br/><br/>He tried to think it right up the dice rolls, hit points, stats, etc.; he doesn't/didn't know very much about RPG theory and certainly doesn't know a lot of games except D&amp;D (3.5, 4E, Path), Fiasco, and VERY LITTLE of BW.<br/><br/>I asked him what kind of game he was trying to design; what's the f***ing object of his game and all that. But he didn't understand my examples and explanations. So I changed the question: is your game going to be about telling stories, about experiencing the fictional world, about facing challenges, or about something else? (In my mind, I asked: "is it N, S, G or what?").<br/><br/>So he understood, and answered that his game was going to be about telling stories. Yeah, cool, we have a start. But we can't start designing a game until we know *what kind of stories would it tell*. So then we got to the "goal", "object", or "whatever-name-you-want-to-give-it" after that discussion.<br/><br/>I think that the creative agendas might be an obsolete concept altogether, but the ideas behind each one of the three (G, N, S) can be thought as macro-goals. These'd help define the actual goal of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20273/the-big-model-rip" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20273/the-big-model-rip" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20273/the-big-model-rip/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F20273%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F20273%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
