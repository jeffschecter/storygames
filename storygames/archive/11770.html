In this post I outline what I've learned, point you to the runners up and finally close with the winner.<br/><br/><em>If you write a contest, make it easy to enter.</em> That's what I learned from this project. By that, not only do I mean make it simple and clean, but also make it attractive. I'd originally titled the contest "Build me a Frame." As soon as I called it "Write 7 Lines in 10 Days" people took interest. It seems obvious in hindsight.<br/><br/><em>If you want to break English, make sure you tell people that's what you're doing.</em> In Hell for Leather Checkpoints don't mean locations, they mean <em>tasks</em>. This was completely miscommunicated. Unless you play specific kinds of shooty video games, the word "Checkpoint" means a point at which a check is made. Did I highlight the difference in the contest? Did I go out of my way to translate my intention? Check the submissions. They shout my mistake.<br/><br/><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Runners Up</span></strong><br/>Which leads me on to the runners up. My god, your brains are big and generous. There were some beauties in there that I'd love to use in the book\u2014but the checkpoints didn't fit the template.
