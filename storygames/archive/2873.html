It's called "Library", although before I could have sworn it had another name, or the description was different, more focued on "firsthand experience game reviews, critiques, etc".  <br/><br/>It is basically a place to review and critique a game, effectively getting into a dialog about that game. No simple "read the game, post a 3 page long review", this is more of a thing where you talk about the game, or even review it as normal, but at the same time starting a conversation on it. Inviting others to share their experiences (good or bad), etc.<br/><br/>What I'd like to do, especially in the face of the fact that:<br/>* We just had a big discussion on giving open, honest reviews and<br/>* A number of such reviews popped open in the past 24 hours,<br/><br/>I figured I'd direct people to perhaps use this category to it's fullest potential.<br/><br/>Here are some thoughts:<br/><br/>1) If you have questions about a game you haven't played or bought, or want to rave about a game briefly, feel free to post in any applicable group.<br/>2) If you have a specific question or problem with a game ("How does movement work in Conan OGL?"), then that's probably best for the Games and Gaming category.<br/><br/>3) "The Game Report" category is best used for games that you've already played. Or that you've read thoroughly and want to critique it. However, our focus is on play.<br/>4) Please think of your post as a mini-review that others can read and reply to.<br/>5) It's a great place to post your first thoughts after playing a new game. Be it traditional, hippy, etc.<br/>6) If you also want to review a game that already has a The Game Report thread somewhere, feel free to either post your review inside the existing Game Report thread for that game, or open up a new thread if you think that would be best for comments and feedback.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's been there for a few months now, I just wanted to shine a little spotlight on it.  Think of it as:<br/><br/><b>"The Game Report" : Story Games' <i>Category of the Month</i>. </b> Mmmmm, sexy.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65589/#Comment_65589" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-26T15:41:42+00:00" title="April 26, 2007  3:41PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>6) If you also want to review a game that already has a The Game Report thread somewhere, feel free to either post your review inside the existing Game Report thread for that game, or open up a new thread if you think that would be best for comments and feedback.</blockquote>\nMay I suggest that, if you are starting a new thread and you know of an old thread, to at least link to the old thread?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
