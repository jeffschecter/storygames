There's a zone in there where young people love this kind of thing (I was recently surprised by how invested my little sister became in a creatively-demanding "story game", and played for 3 hours straight, despite show every sign of not liking that kind of thing in general throughout her life). <br/><br/>I agree with you about the accessibility of a GM-led, "incoherent" game, which allows a single leader to drive up the quality of the game for everyone present, if they have better skills than the other players (and/or higher investment). Such a person will invariably (in my experience) develop some dissatisfaction, bitterness, or plain fatigue, but it certainly makes it easy for people to jump in.<br/><br/>Publishing traditional-style games which make it easier to GM seems like a good way to go. (Perhaps AW is in this vein; perhaps not. Would have to get a young person's or inexperienced gamer's perspective on it!)<br/><br/>One thing that puzzles me, though, is this idea: that games being more casual/lower investment attracts more players, since it's easier for them to jump in and start playing. I'm not sure that's actually true, since it's often the "crunchiest", most "rules-heavy" games which seem to be popular. For example, a lot of big-name games release a "Lite" version of the rules for free. Those don't seem to get all that much play compared to the "full game", at least from what I've seen.<br/><br/>At some level it's clear that a large portion of the market prefers a "rules-heavy" approach. <br/><br/>That might not be as simple as it appears on the surface. <br/><br/>In any case, roleplaying game enthusiasts are almost all Hardcore gamers (as opposed to Casual gamers). There's a big difference between playing a round of Apples to Apples and starting a D&amp;D campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441588/#Comment_441588" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-16T19:35:48+00:00" title="January 16, 2015  7:35PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The contrasting idea to "people want easy games" is "people want clear rules". This has been a big theme in the history of RPG texts, the '74 D&amp;D already addressed the conundrum by requesting the gamers to fill in the gaps themselves according to the needs of their own campaign. The immediate counter-reaction can be seen in many pre-'90s games that specifically compete with the sales argument of comprehensive, detailed rules that are presumed to reduce the amount of uncertainty and skill in the game. <i>Rolemaster</i>, for example, seems to me like it lives and breathes this ethos.<br/><br/>Which is fundamentally true, or can one speak of fundamentals on a matter like this? Those two ideas are not technically speaking in complete opposition, as a game can be both simple and given to clear procedures, but there is still a hard core to the knot that cannot be split: a game that does not provide detail will necessarily require creative inspiration, and a game that provides the detail cannot be effortless.<br/><br/>I went pretty far with the "people want easy games" doctrine in <i>Zombie Cinema</i>, including the fundamental admission that yes, making the game simple and detail-free also unavoidably makes it skill-based, non-fun for unimaginative people to play. It was a middling success by the measures I planned for the project, indicating that there is an audience and there probably would be more potential for that type of story game in the market for a bigger company to exploit; it's not a secret gold mine or anything, but all indications are that e.g. boardgamers, creative artists and other marginal rpg audiences are ready and receptive for that sort of casual/creative game. I understand that the experience from e.g. <i>Fiasco</i> is similar, although they might have charted the market potential more thoroughly, as their project was bigger.<br/><br/>On the other hand, as Paul said, real commercial success has generally come to rpgs that are detailed in terms of crunch and setting, yet vague in terms of creative agenda. I think it's pretty credible that this reflects the genuine nature of the audience; there is a minority audience (of which pretty much everybody reading this forum is likely a member) that desires otherwise, but for many people the complex gamebook full of detail is an important imaginative tool and aesthetic experience in itself. Whether this is necessarily so due to human nature, or if the rpg hobby was transformed in this way by the early commercialization at the end of the '70s is a more complex issue, although I would personally lean towards nature rather than nurture here.<br/><br/>Presumably the messiah product would include all the winning points so far: a compelling subject matter, a GM role for social construction of the gaming group, plentiful imaginative and rules detail in the rulebook to support and supply creativity, clean and elegant game design with intelligible creative goals, written in a lightweight and accessible manner. Not all of those can be perfectly accomplished together, but achieving near-perfection in all of them at once, coupled with an ambitious marketing plan, <i>should</i> provide an interesting case study on whether there is any dynamism to the rpg market, or if it's all just the same fuddies rebuying D&amp;D over and over <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441590/#Comment_441590" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-16T19:49:33+00:00" title="January 16, 2015  7:49PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>I am curious why you lean towards "nature rather than nurture", even while you recognize that it could be "the same fuddies rebuying D&amp;D over and over".

Try to keep pejoratives out of your conversation, lest someone Edwards himself!<br/><br/>Frankly I'm stymied by how stymied you are.  To me the whole issue sounds like: <b>"Experimental theater lovers can't figure out why the audience's hunger for improv troupes and murder mystery games hasn't overtaken the appeal of movies and stageplays, nor obliterated the jobs of Writers and Directors."</b><br/><br/>Perhaps "world domination" is the wrong goal for people who consider egalitarianism to be a core value in art?  To put it another way: You are an egalitarian at your table, but are you an egalitarian in the real world to <i>me</i> - a fellow artist who often works in a medium you consider "incoherent"?  Think about it.<br/><br/>The structure you decry - that of the "IGT game" - is more democratic.  <i>Democracy is not about sameness.</i>  Democracy is about working together despite <i>differences</i>.  Democracy is "you do what you do and I'll do what I do, and even though we're very different, we'll support each other."<br/><br/>The "IGT game" - like the writer/director/actor structure of stage and screen - understands the <i>differences</i> between people: their dedication levels, their talents and their tendencies.  It empowers and rewards different types of people in different ways.  It assumes, naturally, that greater responsibility will reside with those who <i>desire it and make it their own</i>.  It augments and empowers that smaller set of people whose dedication to their artform is beyond that of the larger set of people, who enjoy playing.<br/><br/>If we really want to increase the appeal of roleplaying as a pastime for "regular" people, it certainly wouldn't hurt to put our internecine squabbles behind us.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441593/#Comment_441593" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-16T20:05:33+00:00" title="January 16, 2015  8:05PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great post, Tod!<br/><br/>I think the question implicit here is not just "why don't modern games overtake older games", but "why don't modern overtake older games, <i>given</i> the well-known problems those games carry"? (In other words, the very issues that most people who do not game anymore will cite for leaving - too slow/long-term, too difficult to keep a group together, too demanding in terms of prep, etc, etc. - and that some modern games have arguably conquered.)<br/><br/>It's also worth noting that much of the flexibility and empowerment you describe as present in "IGT games" isn't, strictly speaking, to be found in the games and/or books. It seems to be more often a feature of the people who run those games (I've seen plenty of GMs run old-school-style games very "democratically", or at least attempt to do so, and did so myself when I first GMed). If it is *people* rather than *games* which create this dynamic (the GM as organizer, arbitrator, artist, teacher, and social leader), then what will happen when those people die out/move on/get bored?<br/><br/>Then again, it could be an inevitable feature of that style of gaming. I'm not sure about that, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441594/#Comment_441594" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-16T20:18:34+00:00" title="January 16, 2015  8:18PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, it's the people.

They should be boycotted until they get their shit together.  I think this occurs naturally as well, but perhaps the reasons should be more explicit.  If you drop a GM, you should say why.

In particular, this part...<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;environment where one might be a facilitator or GM but then gets no special kudos for it (and instead might get frustrated when he sees, dealing with Casual/Non players, how no one else rises up to be a facilitator/GM in her place, feeling stuck in a traditional-ish GM-like role all over again).&lt;&lt;<br/><br/>...really resonated with me. I long to play in coherent games, but instead just run them. I probably need to facilitate a long-term GM-less game, but<br/><br/>(a) my last effort crashed and burned due to crazy interpersonal drama<br/>(b) as you point out, there can be the same or similar issues of dissatisfaction / burnout in that role as with the traditional GM role<br/><br/>You're also certainly right that you might be able to get a group of non-gamers to, e.g., play &lt;i&gt;Fiasco; they'll likely have a good time if they're the right sort of people, but they won't become gamers. I've also done some GMing with lapsed trad gamers; they loved the indie games I was running (BW and Lady Blackbird and a few others), but didn't become involved in the hobby again in any sort of ongoing way. BUT! I think those two things are *better outcomes* than having people try D&amp;D or Vampire once and feel excluded and frustrated. At the very least, people who try (coherent) gaming once, or try it once as an adult, won't go away from the hobby embittered or thinking we're all basement-dwelling weirdos with terrible social skills. That's a win, in my book.<br/><br/>Personally I'm convinced that there's no reason to try to make RPGs go mainstream, that they never will, and that this is ultimately a good thing. Interactive, demanding media will always be dwarfed by passive ones, for a huge host of reasons.<br/><br/>I want to offer an additional hypothesis as to why it's actually harder to get people to stick with more egalitarian games: when you get a GM plus a bunch of players, the GM may burn out, but the players are basically happy in their roles: they can get their expected dopamine hit just by showing up every week. But when you get a bunch of GMs together, which is essentially what you need for many coherent games, everyone quickly wants to try their own thing. In other words, the very personality trait that allows someone to be, for example, an excellent co-player in Polaris, is the <i>same thing</i> (or closely related to the thing) that makes it hard for that person to play Burning Wheel (let alone D&amp;D) for 50-100 sessions.<br/><br/>Now, I do think there are some excellent games bridging the gap. Dungeon World, FATE, and 5E run by an indie GM, just to name a few examples, can both do a lot to gently teach people how to contribute a little bit more than just playing their characters, while still supporting both traditional aesthetic material ("adventure gaming") and GM/player distinctions. And there are some great apps and educational tools coming out that bridge the paper/digital divide, such as the "Choice Of" games and of course Storium.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441596/#Comment_441596" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-16T20:22:15+00:00" title="January 16, 2015  8:22PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As we can see with 5e, sometimes older games pick up ideas from the indies (whether they get them right or wrong is another question).

Is there anything in particular that causes you to lean in one direction over the other, or just a hunch?</blockquote>\nA hunch about human nature. If I had to choose between "humans in general are imaginative and independent" and "humans in general are pliant and conservative", I'd go for the latter more than the former. It follows that the nature of the rpg scene may best be characterized as something uniquely developed in the window between the invention of the form and the development of video gaming; a large number of people were inducted into the hobby at a time when it possessed actual competitive advantage versus alternate pastimes. (As opposed to today, when "imaginative and independent" are pretty much the only qualities rpgs compete in compared to video games.)<br/><br/>So it could be the case that the actual hobbyists playing roleplaying games are running on a sort of a demographic deficit of imagination, caused by hobbyists in the 30+ age brackets having self-selected for the hobby before alternatives better suited to their personal nature became prominent through the '90s. This might explain the preferences of the rpg scene in part: while from an armchair it looks like you'd only want to play rpgs if you were especially imaginative and had deep creative needs (because other kinds of needs may be better served by e.g. boardgames or video games), in actual fact the people actually exercising the medium may simply be doing it out of habit, and due to accumulated experience overcoming personal leanings. Sort of like if you taught a child to play Chess at an early age, they might continue doing it despite it being out of character for their adult personality, simply because the game is so familiar and they're so good at it that the expertise enables them to enjoy it despite the natural handicap.<br/><br/>(This, incidentally, would explain much about the popularity of the Game Master as a design solution: if the gamer population includes a large number of people who are not naturally inclined towards creativity and personal creative expression, then a role division that reflects these preferences might be quite optimal for the actual people in their social circles, making choices about their pastimes. Games that require everybody to be storytellers wouldn't flourish in a hobby where 85% of the people are naturally inclined to play World of Warcraft or such.)<br/><br/>If something like this is going on, we should theoretically see a demographic shift in the rpg scene once the big pre-90s age groups leave the hobby with age over the next 20-40 years, leaving behind younger people who chose rpgs over modern digital entertainment, instead of coming into the hobby because it was the only game in town. Arguably we already saw one shift of that type in the '90s, when a large number of gamers opted for TCGs and video games. If these early quitters (as compared to us "rpg for life" types) came predominantly from non-GMing parts of the gamer population, then that would in part explain how the stature of the GM fell through the next decade; with the herds thinning, the individual alpha gamers banded together and discovered the possibilities of gaming in smaller, more dedicated groups. No more giant 12+ player games and "GM is king" when your group's only got 4 regulars and they all GM in turn.<br/><br/>So in a nutshell I guess my argument goes something like this: gamers want the kinds of rpg books they want because they are the kind of people who would want those specific things from a rpg book. They want rpg books because that's their chosen hobby, due to the particulars of cultural history; if other kinds of people were predominant in the hobby, as they might be in the future, they might want/need different kinds of game texts. Thus, nature of the gamer stock might determine the nature of the rpg books. After all, if it were nurture, one would expect the clear "do it yourself" message of the original D&amp;D to have persisted more than it did.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441603/#Comment_441603" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-16T21:33:53+00:00" title="January 16, 2015  9:33PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Makes sense to me, Eero.

The heavy changes to emphasis that the 4th edition made disillusioned many people who wanted a game that could still be used to play in the way they liked. I've seen this personally among my friends, some of whom are serial D&amp;D-heads (progressing along the game as new editions are published for the sake of novelty) - while I think they appreciated the 4th edition change of pace, it seems to me that they're happier with the 5th, which enables a more traditional playstyle.<br/><br/>Applying this to your speculation, Paul, I would hazard that a Dungeon World with D&amp;D's name would be similarly problematic for the publisher as 4th edition was; not insurmountable (I understand that 4th failed due to tactical errors in the marketplace more than strategic problems), but impossible to ignore. It seems to me that attaching a well-known brand name to a radically different game only makes sense for the people who were not happy with the old game, and imagine that this unhappiness is universal. Unless a change of direction can bring in a substantially larger new audience, it doesn't seem sensible to stop catering to the old.<br/><br/>Of course, I also think that obsessing over the D&amp;D brand name is intellectual weakness (unless you happen to own it, of course); if whatever your game is can't find its place in the market without attaching the D&amp;D name to it, perhaps it's not such an amazing game after all. And even if you managed to undermine the D&amp;D brand like that, what victory when the audience you coup apparently consists solely of trend-skimmers who'll switch to Dungeon World (or whatever) merely because of a brand name...<br/><br/>Considering the substance of the speculation, I think that 4th edition is roughly as far away from the historical tradition of D&amp;D (old and new school) as Dungeon World, so in that regard it'd be no more impossible a switcheroo as the prior experiment. Of course it should use the traditional dice mechanics and so on, but that's a minor issue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441611/#Comment_441611" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-17T07:20:20+00:00" title="January 17, 2015  7:20AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this idea that sales success and popular adoption has anything to do with rules coherence is wildly off base.  It's not that the world has looked at indie RPGs from any particular point in history and said, "Nah, not my bag."  Instead, most theoretical buyers/players simply never encounter an indie RPG, period.<br/><br/>I seem to recall that Evil Hat has made most of their sales through retail.  How many indie games get to a relevant number of stores?<br/><br/>FATE, Burning Wheel, Apocalyspe World and a few others have managed to reach mostly the same old audience of roleplayers in unique ways that secured each a niche, and each of them is friendly to some audience out there in ways in which D&amp;D is not.  But this idea of finding people who don't roleplay and wouldn't like D&amp;D, and wowing them with some indie design, is an extremely fringe proposition.  (I mean, personally, I hold out hope of doing exactly that, because I can live off very, very little money.  But it certainly isn't a game-changer for the hobby.)<br/><br/>Fiasco might be a little different, I'm not sure.  It might have some new audience members, but I get the same sense of a channel that doesn't leave room for piggybacking.  I haven't heard of Fiasco acting as a gateway for prior non-gamers to get into Polaris or Zombie Cinema or Shock: or even other Bully Pulpit games.<br/><br/>If you want to grab young teens with your storytelling system, you need to catch them in places they actually frequent, and show them how introducing your game to their friends will earn them those friends' love.  I discovered roleplaying because D&amp;D was in the comics store where I went in search of Spider-Man, and it enabled my friends and I to validate our power fantasies with numbers.  Are any indie designers driven to produce something like that, which retailers will recognize as such?<br/><br/>It seems more realistic to me to expand into the Party Games market by offering RPGs that are comedic, have roles for players who don't like to think much, and come in boxes with pretty game pieces.  But even that is too expensive and complex a start-up proposition for most lone creatives.  Take <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1935913034" rel="nofollow">Shindig Machine</a>: its rules make it a hit at parties, but a box of cards with no particular flavor or premise seems hard to market, and indeed, I've never seen it at a store.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441612/#Comment_441612" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-17T07:28:28+00:00" title="January 17, 2015  7:28AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2015 7:30AM by David_Berg.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For anyone who wants hard data on where sales are made, Fred Hicks has blogged such things for years.

Reading through the comments and the article, I will say you can catch more flies with honey than vinegar. <br/><br/>For me the thing that deters me most from trying a new game is the tone of its fan base and enthusiasts. If someone brings me a new RPG and says I should try it because they love it and think I will too, I'll happily give it a shot. If someone brings a new RPG and tells me I should try it because it isn't like the rubbish I normally play, I am going to be a lot less inclined to listen because they started the conversation by insulting me. It is when people speak in terms of evolution of design, or frame styles of play in moral terms that I tend to tune out. There are many niches in the hobby and room for all of them. There is also always a mainstream that draws as needed from the different gaming scenes. It is unlikely the mainstream will ever be 100% indie just like it is unlikely the mainstream will be 100% traditional or old school. By its very nature the gaming mainstream needs to appeal to a broad demographic of players and GMs, so it moves ideas to the middle. <br/><br/>If you look at a game like Numenera for example, it is winning over many folks on my side of the hobby (not all, but many). I think the reason is partly the incredible setting, but also has a lot to do with the fact that Monte Cook is an incredibly positive guy. He didn't compare Numenera to games that do things differently (and neither did anyone on his staff). He just talked enthusiastically about the game and its mechanics. It wasn't presented as a choice between liking Numenera and liking D&amp;D. And he didn't lament the people who didn't adopt the game as failing to understand his vision or not being willing to try new things. <br/><br/>I know a lot of traditional gamers who have been more than willing to give it a try, even though by traditional standards it has some indie elements to it.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441640/#Comment_441640" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-18T16:37:47+00:00" title="January 18, 2015  4:37PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I used to encounter this a lot when I was doing my indie evangelization thing here in Finland.

Keep in mind there is a huge middle ground between Traditional and Indie players. So while your approach may connect you specifically to indie-minded players, there is a swath of mainstream players who may be ignoring your sales pitch because they also like traditional things as well. It isn't about fawning over traditional gamers (who are not all "old"). It is simply about not insulting them.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441643/#Comment_441643" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-18T17:00:17+00:00" title="January 18, 2015  5:00PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm actually turning my back to roleplaying gamers for my games.

Calling traditional gaming "incoherent" and "outdated" is done with some love, and also with some desire to remind us of the particular strengths of some indie stuff (i.e. "focused" and "novel").<br/><br/>But that's not how it sounds to people outside the indie circles.  "Incoherent", absent context, sounds more like an accusation, and less like a comparative critique.<br/><br/>I think Brendan's 100% correct that "look at why my game is cool" needn't have anything to do with specifying "as opposed to other games!"  Designers are problem-solvers, and it is absolutely constructive to think in terms of solving other games' problems while designing.  But at pitch time, we have to take off our designer hats and put on our hobby enthusiast ones.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441681/#Comment_441681" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-19T11:31:26+00:00" title="January 19, 2015 11:31AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What has "pitching" to do with the subject of the article?<br/>Why should an article about coherent game design give a damn about how "traditional" players might misunderstand the technical terms used?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441682/#Comment_441682" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-19T11:45:54+00:00" title="January 19, 2015 11:45AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 19, 2015 1:26PM by Rickard.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed about the second point.

If you want to completely refocus the thread, because you would have preferred to talk design, then feel free (though I bet you'd have better luck starting a new thread).  But if we're talking about reaching audiences, then pitching strikes me as being extremely on topic, as does the general state of how indie RPGs are represented in places like blogs and forums.

If you are making cars and you have some great new piece of tech that people are resisting for some reason (but that maybe a small group of people have adopted) I think it can be counter productive to assume the issue is the people not adopting are a stubborn herd of dinosaurs who are blocking change. I think what is going on is both these groups simply have different needs (or you are not communicating what you have achieved in a way that reaches the 'dinosaur' demographic). I don't see any issue with identifying problems and fixing them. What I don't understand is the need to characterize a large segment of the hobby and its preferences in such negative terms. That seems superfluous to me. Now maybe I am just overly sensitive or misreading what is being said because I belong to that demographic...but looking at the comments and the article, the jabs seem obvious and needless.

On the one hand he frames it as an inevitable takeover in explicitly darwinian terms. On the other hand, it views this entirely as an issue of one side preferring what the author views as flawed or outmoded design because it empowers<i><b> "People passionate (stubborn?) enough to put a lot of effort, time and energy to get what they want from a game that in and of itself works against them. People dedicated enough to their hobby to buy, read and understand a book of 300 pages \u201cjust to play a game\u201d. People willing to explain such a game to others, to actually find others to play, pitching the game enthusiastically in order to convince friends to sit down and play, that day, at that hour, once a week." </b></i><br/><br/>He is essentially building a straw man in my view. Depicting it as a conflict between people like me who like broken game systems and people who like non-broken game systems. The only way he can possibly explain why I like something that is broken is to offer up some kind of pathology, where I literally must enjoy fixing the broken thing and the power that it gives me over other people. That is both insulting and absurd. <br/><br/>To me this reveals an assumption where design is being framed in almost moral terms (at the very least, judgmental terms). <br/><br/>As you go down the article he just kind of compares to two sides of the hobby, depicting those who like indie mechanics as creative and active, and those who like traditional as passive and uncreative (because they are just there for the GM's story). <br/><br/>If you want to build a workable theory of design, that is fine. But you can't do that if it is based on a caricature of the style you are critiquing. <br/><br/>He is also failing to understand in my view that what is going on in the market is not an inevitable take over of the hobby by indie mechanics. Rather the mainstream is absorbing in bits and pieces what it finds useful from various niches in the hobby (including his).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441702/#Comment_441702" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-19T16:40:08+00:00" title="January 19, 2015  4:40PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">@Bedrockbrendan</a>: Perhaps you are not his targeted audience?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441704/#Comment_441704" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-19T16:47:00+00:00" title="January 19, 2015  4:47PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">@Bedrockbrendan</a>: Perhaps you are not his targeted audience?</blockquote>\nNo doubt, I probably am not. But since he the article is focused on the inability of the indie scene to pull in people like me, I felt my thoughts on the subject might be of benefit here. I guess I am trying to say some of the assumptions may be wrong because he isn't painting an accurate picture of the people he is talking about. The description he offers of the motivations behind the traditional gamer, and how the traditional gamer plays, is nothing like my experience at all, and nothing like I see among the traditional gamers I know. It is also, a bit insulting, and part of my point is if your analysis is built on prejudicial assumptions, it will be flawed and it will fail to connect to the people you are trying to reach. There is the additional issue that gamers are not divided into a Indie and Traditional. There is a huge middle ground. By dividing the hobby into its two most extreme ends, means you will fail before you even start because you don't understand the middle. <br/><br/>I get that the article is fundamentally trying to address the question of why indie mechanics haven't taken over the hobby yet, and if they are maybe targeting the wrong demographic. That is a fair thing to ask. But at the same time, I wonder if it isn't like the OSR guy lamenting that the hobby hasn't been taken over by Basic D&amp;D or OSRIC. These are still successful movements that influence the mainstream. There is something to be said for that. In the same way, games like Numenera, which is mainstream, have adopted some indie trends (and traditional gamers have largely accepted it).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli" title="davidepignedoli"><img alt="davidepignedoli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli">davidepignedoli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441706/#Comment_441706" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-19T16:51:48+00:00" title="January 19, 2015  4:51PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought about a few points, which might be interesting to perhaps discuss further:<br/><br/>- several "indie" games (let's use this term as in "Read what people mean, not what they write.") are faster to pick up, and provide a meaningful experience usually within the first session, or anyway a few sessions of play<br/><br/>- this is often a desired result; in other words, the author knows that there is the need to quickly deliver a result, for two reasons: a) if the players come from a different background - let's call it traditional - they might be tempted to go back to the "usual" game unless they're really captured by the new experience from the very start, and b) if they are "indie" players they might be tempted to try yet another game, if this one fails to deliver quickly<br/><br/>- this 'fast' experience somehow contributes to the feeling of having explored what the game has to give. Yes, it can be played again, but the Players know how it will be - in other words, it can be fun but not that 'deep', perhaps. You can pick a different playbook but the game 'crunch' will feel very similar<br/><br/>- opposed to this (fast to learn, to play, to enjoy), a "traditional" game requires more commitment: learn more rules, explore different characters *builds*, experience the difference in game-play in different levels (i.e. DW provides from the start relatively strong characters - this is a great "sales pitch" somehow, but sometimes it feels like playing a first-person-shooter with God-Mode-On. Easier, less challenging). The higher level of commitment required to learn and play a D&amp;D or a Numenera (just to make a couple of examples) is perceived as a barrier by some (personally, I looked at Numenera. Very nice images. Reading the manual? Nah. But me-20-years-ago would have read it), but what is barrier for some, it is tempting for others. Commitment translates into loyalty. Without any intention to insult anybody, there are people who love videogames based on 'farming' and literally crawling level after level to pick up coin after coin so that they can buy access to a higher level where they crawl coin after coin to access a higher level where ...<br/><br/>- finally, a high level of commitment, from a psychological point of view, is a great barrier towards switching system<br/><br/>Anyway, this is not formalized nor well presented... but I hope can be relevant for the brain-storming style of the discussion...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441707/#Comment_441707" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-19T17:02:27+00:00" title="January 19, 2015  5:02PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 19, 2015 5:06PM by Rickard.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">@Bedrockbrendan</a>: Perhaps you are not his targeted audience?</blockquote>\nNo doubt, I probably am not.</blockquote>\nThen, if you're not then a) why bother,  and b) why participate in this discussion?<br/><br/>I know you kinda answered the first rhetorical question, but still ... everything that is written about this hobby is not related to how you play and your judgement about roleplaying games.

I would even characterize it as valuable for daring to question; these Internet echo chambers could learn to get along better with widely differing viewpoints anyway. Brendan's been nothing but polite here, so I don't see a reason for what seems to me like an attempt to shut him up.<br/><br/>I think it's a solid observation that identity politics play a role in the popularity of cultural trends in gaming, and thus it's not just about the substance of the matter. It is probably true that there are gamers out there who have passed on enjoyable experiences because they have bad impressions about proge or trad or OSR or LARP - not due to their substance, but due to presentation or accompanying social phenomena. Maybe this is part of the explanation for the original question - that being, how come coherent design hasn't swept the market.<br/><br/>Heck, you know about this RPGPundit guy? His whole schtick seems to be that he's pissed off because he feels that proge gamers are trying to undermine his RPG hobby in secret.

I have no desire to weigh in on his position, particularly since he isn't here to clarify or respond. But I take a different view on this subject. My attitude toward different styles of play has also evolved over time. I don't have an issue with people playing games however they like. The only time I get annoyed is when people tell me I am doing something wrong or make assumptions about why I enjoy my style of play. <br/><br/>I am not thinking about identity politics here so much as people simply not pathologizing styles they don't enjoy or understand. At the end of the day these are just preferences people have for gameplay.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace" title="Dreamofpeace"><img alt="Dreamofpeace" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/262/nTKQSP3YRT3C1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace">Dreamofpeace</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441718/#Comment_441718" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-19T22:05:51+00:00" title="January 19, 2015 10:05PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's one design element that may be relevant: the question of prep. Most trad games require substantial prep, while most newer indie games require much less or none - sometimes too much prep can even actively get in the way, depending on the game. <br/><br/>Now some people enjoy prep; it can be fun coming up with a big bad, a trail of clues, and so on.  This is likely a reason someone might prefer a trad game, if the prep for it will be enjoyable for the GM. But the game does not always facilitate or make it easy to do prep or to go from your prep of story elements to actual play. Perhaps an indie game that does this can draw in more trad GMs?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441725/#Comment_441725" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-20T01:56:00+00:00" title="January 20, 2015  1:56AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remember back in the 1990s telling people that rules-light games were not going to replace rules-heavy games, because they hadn't.

Even if many of us may not like some of those aspects of trad games, they're certainly working well from a marketing point of view! Hardly pathologizing.<br/><br/>That most traditional games are amenable to a wide variety of styles, influenced by the GM's preferences and those of the group, than most Forgite (or Forge diaspora, whatever) games, isn't really in dispute, is it?<br/><br/>One question that seems to be getting brushed aside here, but that I think is really fascinating and important to delve into, is whether indie or trad games require more rules buy-in from players. People have sort of implied things in both directions (for good reason, I think). My personal experience has been that most trad groups will function alright with around a third of the group not really grokking the rules, whereas with something indie, especially if it's GM-less, everyone really does have to engage with them (even if they're relatively simple, they may revolve around things of <i>dramatic</i> import like scene framing, so everyone has to understand what makes such things go).<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>My own recent realizations regarding my play preferences certainly highlight what the article is talking about. As much as I love playing light games with memorable mechanics, that can deliver a meaningful experience in a few hours, I really crave the depth that can only come from campaigns. So I've really tried to focus on BW, 5E, and other games that can give that experience, relegating one-shots to cons or special occasions.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441727/#Comment_441727" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-20T05:16:20+00:00" title="January 20, 2015  5:16AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 20, 2015 5:23AM by Paul_T.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All very true.<br/><br/>However, it's very hard to tell (at least for me) what proportion of gamers are playing in a certain style/type of game because they've considered the alternatives but found that they have strong preferences towards the style of gaming they enjoy, and what proportion play the game/s they play because that's all they know, or all they're familiar with?<br/><br/>I'm really not sure, as I've seen arguments in both directions. Certainly it's true that a lot of "trad", mainstream games require such a heavy buy-in (both time and money invested) that it's hard for those players to try new things, while the indie scene tends to run in the opposite direction: a hunger to try new things. Just try suggesting to a group that you heard about this fun game and would like to run it sometime and see what a different reception you get from a long-term D&amp;D group vs. a bunch of indie game fans...<br/><br/>Does anyone have any data on this, whether solid or anecdotal?<br/><br/>I think Deliverator/Matt is definitely on to something when it comes to a preference for long campaigns. (Ironically one of the very things which keeps many people from gaming as much as they'd like, or convinces them to drop gaming altogether...)<br/><br/>"Trad" games certainly tend to encourage and support campaign play by giving lots and lots of doodads and lists and levels and spells and things and stuff to try, setting books to explore, and so on.*<br/><br/>I've often wondered if Apocalypse World was as successful as it was because of this feature as well - a big book (and lots of supplements!) which give a lot of different "stuff" to explore over the long term...<br/><br/><br/>(*: However, I've never understood why a lot of people in the "indie" crowd feel that they can't use "Forgite" mechanics for long-playing campaigns. Sure, some games are designed to play out in one session... but even many of those could be used to play a whole campaign in an "episodic" style: no one's stopping you from doing 25 sessions of interconnected "episodes" of Fiasco all set in the same time and place, for example, and Fiasco is probably one of the most extreme examples.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441729/#Comment_441729" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-20T05:29:27+00:00" title="January 20, 2015  5:29AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 20, 2015 5:35AM by David_Berg.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two separate thoughts:<br/><br/><b>Regarding the role of design</b>, I think Davide made some excellent points.  A one-shot-playable indie game may leave an impression of "That was cool!" but it also leaves a feeling of completion.  A session of a traditional extended-play game, on the other hand, leaves a feeling of unfinished business.  It's not inconceivable to me that most of the folks out there who will step up to play <i>any</i> RPG will also stick around to complete unfinished business; even a one-shot is going to weed out the commitment-averse with its requirements of time and thought.<br/><br/><b>Regarding pathologizing traditional play</b>, I don't think it's conscious or particularly deep-rooted, but I do think it's present in rhetoric.  Ron Edwards has had a big influence on indie discourse, not just with his games and his ideas, but also with the sheer volume of his writing and the tone thereof.  And that tone is rather fond of casually using hyperbolic condemnation of stuff that simply isn't the writer's taste.  Unfortunately, I think this style has been picked up and passed along by a number of folks, who confuse brutal honesty and/or artistic flair with effective communication.<br/><br/>Beyond that, I think Forge-style design is genuinely very, very difficult for some of the folks who attempt it, and so there's a need to validate the effort with some "this way is <i>better</i>"-type thinking.  I mean, if I were content to use traditional approaches to "what the dice handle, and how" then <i>Delve</i> would have been finished and published years ago.  I have to content myself with knowing that what I'm striving for <i>is</i> better... <i>to me</i>.  And not necessarily to anyone else.  (If I ever switch from doing this for me, and move to doing it for "the market", then it should use the d20 system.)  But that's a hard lesson to swallow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[article] Indie Games

~2000 era comprehensive study WOTC did around the time D&amp;D3 came out, they determined that overwhelmingly people play The Current Edition of D&amp;D and don't ever play anything else - if they make it to the next D&amp;D edition and don't like it, they leave the hobby, they don't look elsewhere. If they like the next edition, they happily switch and play that.<br/><br/>Most people then-active in the hobby (as I recall) said they were aware of non-D&amp;D RPGs, but very rarely played them and didn't like them as much as Their edition of D&amp;D.<br/><br/>However, a lot has changed about how games reach people in that time. In 2000, there wasn't really a massive digital book market for RPGs, for example. <br/><br/>I don't mind game designers spitting on people who don't play the way they wish - that's just marketing!  All kinds of ads try to make me feel like I'm special and better than those other people who consume that other brand of beer, model of car, or fast food hamburger, why should game designers be different?  Remember that the businessperson is the born, sworn, vicious enemy of the consumer in our current system and it makes perfect sense that it should go this way. I remember being told that I was special for buying the right RPG in 1989 - Ron Edwards didn't need to do it, he didn't change anything (about that.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441735/#Comment_441735" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-20T06:24:51+00:00" title="January 20, 2015  6:24AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a bit of an aside, there are actually quite a good number of indie games that I am fucking sick to death of playing as one-shots.

It's like comparing ice hockey games to only eating bread, or a car to a slinky.<br/><br/>If you instead look at them as categories, you can realize that bread is part of "food" and it would be boring to only eat one type of food. You got instead all kinds of ingredients so you can eat variously. I myself have played certain board games so they aren't funny any more. Do I blame board games as a category for that? No, I move on to a different board game.<br/><br/>If you look at one type of game and expect the same thing of another type of game, of course the second type of game can't match it. The same goes the opposite way: hockey differs from game to game, but bread will drive the hunger away.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441753/#Comment_441753" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-20T13:52:01+00:00" title="January 20, 2015  1:52PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am a little skeptical on the point about marketing. Maybe some car commercials do that. I think they are usually more subtle in how they achieve it. But I question whether attacking 75% of the hobby is going to be worth the small percentage of players it opens you up to. Sure it may be pulling in some of those select gamers you are going for. But the thing people are asking here is why some of these indie games haven't reached a broader audience. My point is if your sales pitch and design framework insults the majority of gamers, of course people will resist you. Certainly a car company like Jaguar can turn a profit by slamming people who can't afford their cars if they choose, but they also cost 50,000-90,000 dollars. They make up for that lost part of the market by charging more for their vehicles. I suppose you also see this kind of marketing with organic food but even that costs more and the marketing tends to butter up the target customers rather than rip apart the people that don't buy their stuff. Also this stuff does bleed into the community, so if your players' attitude start to match your marketing, then it will create even more resistance to what you are selling because your existing customers will be turning off new customers left and right. This exists among traditional gamers as well, and I don't think it is terribly productive in winning over people.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441754/#Comment_441754" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-20T13:59:41+00:00" title="January 20, 2015  1:59PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Oh, totally agreed!

Generally I think something that gives people longer campaign life is probably going to reach more people, simply because people are actively playing it more. It seems like more indie games are adopting the campaign model though as people point out. <br/><br/>Dungeon World is an interesting example. I haven't played it, and only know about it from what people have told me (including a player in my group who has the book and likes it). I've seen two reactions among traditional gamers. They either don't get it/like it because it feels too constricting or solves problems they never felt they had, or they see it as totally in line with traditional play but just presents itself in a different way (most of the discussion seems to revolve around something called 'moves'). I'm sure there are more reactions to it than that. But those are the two I've seen at least. I would say people are pretty divided on it on the traditional end of the spectrum. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441755/#Comment_441755" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-20T14:06:27+00:00" title="January 20, 2015  2:06PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Several of the most notable indie RPGs have avoided negative marketing. Fiasco and FATE come to mind. Although they've achieved some recognition, some market penetration, they're hardly conquered the world. So I don't buy that the perception that indie gamers are mean elitists is somehow the missing variable in what Alessandro is talking about. Because again, even if we assume no missteps in the way the game is marketed, taught, and run, these games, for whatever reason, breed less long-term loyalty than D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Note that this phenomenon is real, I've seen it in action several times.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441757/#Comment_441757" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-20T14:26:45+00:00" title="January 20, 2015  2:26PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            just keep in mind almost no games but D&amp;D conquer the world.

It isn't D&amp;D but it is pretty much the best you can hope for if you are not D&amp;D. I'd certainly be willing to cut off a digit or two for that level of success. And as you point out, they didn't resort to negative marketing. So I don't think it has zero impact. I am sure there is a built in limit on how far any niche product can break into the mainstream.

However, getting them to do it for hours on end is hard.<br/><br/>The problem, therefore, is not the gap between what RPG designers <i>can</i> do and what audiences will accept; it's the gap between what RPG designers <i>want</i> to do and what audiences will accept.  <br/><br/>No one who loves RPGs so much that they get inspired to make their own wants to game for 15 minutes.  Our motives aren't <i>just</i> to Play Pretend, but also to advance through cycles of change that feel like they mean something.  And that takes time.  So now we're back to longer games, and back to questioning whether reaching gamers or non-gamers is more realistic.<br/><br/>Brainstorm: I suppose an RPG that you can truly <i>win</i> might extend the casual gamer's time window and compress the hardcore gamer's time window toward each other.  But winning an RPG where the RP really matters remains a really tough spec.

I'll throw in a few more points:<br/><br/>1. Another aspect of our hobby that we sometimes take for granted is that it is dependent on skill level.<br/><br/>Kind of like playing music or juggling or computer programming or playing on a sports team, it is sometimes only really fun when the participants have developed some skills and put some serious thought into the game.<br/><br/>This is where the traditional game setup can shine: you often only need one skilled player (the GM) to *lead* the others through the game, and new players can join in at any time without disrupting things too much.<br/><br/>The "indie" approach has been to try to make the games easier to play by developing more and more advanced tools. They've made huge strides along these lines, but clearly not enough to win over a broader market. (Unlike Cards Against Humanity, you can't just grab any random group of people, play Fiasco, and have a great time. They have to also *play well*.)<br/><br/>I wonder if there might be some advantage in <i>presenting what we do as a skilled art</i>? Instead of trying to sell people on how easy and fun it is, don't you see... maybe try to market RPGs as something you can work on to develop your creativity and your intelligence, like art lessons or meditation classes.<br/><br/>That would certainly attract a very different crowd, with different expectations, than "Hey, try this thing, it's really really fun, I promise!"<br/><br/>2. Freeform online gaming clearly has a large following, and people commit to that kind of thing for huge periods of their lives. It works in part because it's a social activity (i.e. peer pressure, a sense of belonging, cycles of affirmation and feedback).<br/><br/>I think the next thing to see would be some kind of organized online freeform: build an indie-mechanics-style game that works on a social platform (perhaps an app on your phone, or maybe it works like a Facebook game). The mechanics all feed into group approval - when your character does something everyone loves, you get "+1s" from everyone else playing, when people react to what you do and it makes them do something, you get Weebly points, when you do something everyone wants to prevent, you get Dark Side points, whatever. Basically the whole game is based on variations on Fanmail from PTA, and gaining resources which allow you to do cool things (buy new abilities, whether in-fiction - the ability to fly, a nice mansion, whatever - or in the game - you can now use images in your posts, or you have the power to summon any other player).<br/><br/>I don't think it would be too hard to design, but of course the marketing would the challenge. If it hit critical mass I think it could do really well.<br/><br/>Of course, no saying if actual gamers would like it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441780/#Comment_441780" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-20T18:53:46+00:00" title="January 20, 2015  6:53PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rickard,<br/><br/>Can you tell us more about the difference between short games and long games?<br/><br/>I'm not sure I understand your point, exactly.

We can only play ONE thing with it. But we got different kinds of movies to choose from. We don't need to see the same thing, only the things that we feel to see at the moment. "Care for some <b>Fiasco</b> tonight?" That's how we played in our last group. No one needed to prep. We pitched games on beforehand, but we decided on what to play while we were there.\n<blockquote>Where do we draw the lines, and how should that affect our design?</blockquote>\nThe line? You can only play in one way with <b>This is Pulp</b>. The game has three acts and the game master can create scenes with tokens. Each token represent the difficulty of a danger, that the players describe their way through with help of the moves on the printed character sheet. The game ends when all the tokens are spent. Each session is a new game with new characters.<br/><br/>If I were to only play This is Pulp for a year I would get bored, and I <i>did </i>play it for a year when I designed it (through playtest). If I only played it with my group, I would become tired of it more quickly. But I didn't get tired of my game, because I played <i>a lot of different one-shot type of games</i>.<br/><br/>I had a week when I only watched movies made by the Cohen brothers. I nowadays can't watch any of their movies. Typical roleplaying games today are designed so you can play everything. <b>Fiasco</b> did something different with the playsets, but that's only changing the stage. The game, and how it's played out, is still the same. Play it too much, and you will see the formula and become bored of it, just like I did with the Cohen brothers' movies.<br/><br/>Board and card games release new expansions. Munchkin releases new cards with new images, and they are funny the first time you play it. Magic the Gathering releases cards that changes the game play, and you can play it over and over again.<br/><br/>That's how I picture shorter roleplaying games can be made. Release new expansions that expands how you can play the game.<br/><br/>That's my idea with This is Pulp. "Tired of just playing through actions scenes? Here is a horror pack!", "Tired of playing just one-shots? Here is a campaign mode!".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441784/#Comment_441784" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-20T22:03:16+00:00" title="January 20, 2015 10:03PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I tend to agree with Rickard that if "one shot games" are to work for sustained gaming, it needs to BE "one shot GAMES" plural, not "a one shot game."  That, however, has its own problem - namely, that it's eliminating one of the oft-touted advantages of the "one shot game" which is that they are easy to pick up and play.  They are, but if you're picking up and playing a new one every week, maybe not so much.  I mean, I would hesitate to pick up and play a new boardgame every week.<br/><br/>So these one shot games need to provide enough variation than they are interesting to play a few times in a row before you move on.  And weirdly, I'm not sure that I feel that's generally the case.  I mean, I love Lady Blackbird, but I'm not sure I'd like to play it three times back to back (at least, not "starting fresh" each time)  So it seems like the more "focused" you make your game, the tougher it is to get people to want to play it repeatedly? On the other hand, I don't think I'd have any problems playing, say, InSpectres a few times "from scratch" so I don't know if this whole presumption is necessarily true, either.<br/><br/>All that said, I think the obvious halfway point here is what I briefly touched on when I started saying "from scratch" - a game in which you can/should play 2-3 SESSIONS, both to get better at playing it, and to get that sense of "unfinished business" where folks want to come back for more.  The alternative is perhaps something like what Fiasco does, where it's the same GAME, but it has a ton of different "playsets" (I think this is the closest RPGs have gotten to the 'expansion set' model.)  Though this has limitations too.   Maybe a better model would be a ton of different "Powered by Apocalypse" games, where once you basically know how to play PbtA games, there's not too much new "mechanical" learning going on, even if the setting and the mood and flow of the game are completely different. <br/><br/>And all of this is ignoring another elephant in the room - namely the previous (and very correct) assertion that "no game but D&amp;D has ever 'conquered the world'."  This, more than anything, is what leads me to believe that people in this hobby are, in fact, more creatures of habit than anything else.  They find something entertaining, they play it one way, and they have trouble even IMAGINING doing it another way.  I'm speaking from experience here, because this was me 5 years ago or so.  I'd played D&amp;D, WoD, Shadowrun, blahblahinsertTradGameHere.  They were all, when you got down to it, basically the same.  The trappings were different, but really, having played them all, I was left wondering "Why would I need another game system? I can do whatever with whatever system."  It wasn't until I actually READ through (Not "heard about" or whatever, actually looked at, in depth, first hand) some honestly revolutionary games that my brain went "OH! This is completely different! Brilliant!  Some games really ARE better at some things!" While I know I shouldn't project my experiences onto a bunch of other people, I think it's safe to say that relatively few people figuring out what is different or cool or clever about "Indie" games without actually playing or at LEAST reading one.  And since the prevailing mindset is basically, "I like this game and it can do everything, so why do I need another game system?" I think it's also a safe bet to say that there might be quite a lot of people who would like this stuff if only there were some way to communicate it to them. But that is SUPER HARD.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441794/#Comment_441794" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-21T02:28:20+00:00" title="January 21, 2015  2:28AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, and someone who likes D&amp;D probably likes it in part because they can play it for a really long time and have varied experiences with it.

Because when you gotten into that habit, it starts to individualize you.

I can see that tendency <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/441791/#Comment_441791" rel="nofollow">here as well</a>.\n<blockquote>They are, but if you're picking up and playing a new one every week, maybe not so much.  I mean, I would hesitate to pick up and play a new boardgame every week.</blockquote>\nTrue, but I wonder if this is a realistic perspective. If I compare my last play group with my board gaming group, in both groups, we all had 3-4 games each that we pitched. In a group consisting of five people, that's at least fifteen different games, and it's enough for us to have enough variance in gaming. We still have favorites, like <b>Kings of Tokyo</b> at the moment, that we played so much that we're starting to get tired of it. What we did was going back to some of the older games, <b>Carcassone</b> for example, because they started to feel fresh again.<br/><br/>Having shorter games makes, at least, me also to be more open to play through some of the games that I'm not that fond of, like <b>Munchkin</b>, if some other person really wants to play it. <b>This is Pulp</b> is played over 90 minutes. Do you need to fill out 3-4 hours? Then play it twice! That's how we do with board games.<br/><br/>Ever had a roleplaying game that you really want to play but no one else wants to play it? If it's a short game that I haven't tried, at least I can try it. I can throw away 90 minutes to check out a new game (but I'm curious about new games so I can't hold this as a standard). Can I do the same commitment to longer games?<br/><br/>This is why I don't want to compare short and long term games. They are used for different purposes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441820/#Comment_441820" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-21T18:50:14+00:00" title="January 21, 2015  6:50PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm totally with you on the time stuff, Rickard; I have a friend who always buys these massive, complicated, 3-4+ hour boardgames and is all excited to play them, and everyone else sortof shuffles their feet and looks awkward and says "Maybe next week..." whereas if someone pitches a game that takes 1-2 hours, tops, I'm usually prepared to shrug and say, "Well, okay."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441921/#Comment_441921" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-23T00:28:03+00:00" title="January 23, 2015 12:28AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very, very interesting points all around, great discussion! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/>I'm especially interested in these points... \n<blockquote><br/>1.

Something quick and snappy, either PvP or PvE, but with a <b>fiction-first</b> approach.<br/><br/>On point 2. this is something I'm really interested in working on, but have not enough technical skills to put together... I have a bunch of ideas I hope to one day shape into something tangible. Does anyone remember the now dead <b>The Lattice</b> pbf universe?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441923/#Comment_441923" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-23T00:51:12+00:00" title="January 23, 2015 12:51AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 23, 2015 12:51AM by James_Stuart.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/paul_t">@paul_t</a> : what is your evaluation of  Storium as far as online freeform with indieish mechanics?<br/><br/>At the very least, it shows that tons of people online will give that a whirl.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441929/#Comment_441929" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-23T05:43:00+00:00" title="January 23, 2015  5:43AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James,<br/><br/>I haven't played Storium.

Some mechanics or conceits might get in the way of long term, but I don't think there are many magic formulas for mechanics that can help promote long term campaigns beyond things like XP, a sense in the game itself of building on past accomplishments and events, and cool items or rewards. I think the biggest thing though that limits a campaign's length, is whether the setting lends itself to long or short games. A game like D&amp;D, I've never had a problem maintaining a campaign. The set up seems to naturally lead to longer play. But some other games, I will tend to run more as mini-games or even one shots. <br/><br/>That said I do think how things like XP are rewarded can shape the way people play. If you are giving XP for treasure earned versus monsters killed, that does encourage somewhat different behavior.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441965/#Comment_441965" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-24T14:00:14+00:00" title="January 24, 2015  2:00PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You want something that create expectations, to keep up long term play, either in how it's going to be used or what will come of this new thing that entered.
