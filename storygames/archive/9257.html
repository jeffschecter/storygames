The game I present here is part of my "progressive teaching game", a term that was introduced by Jason in the said thread.<br/><br/>Here is my intial comments on the "steps" to cover in a series of games of that kind, designed to teach players how to interact in modern day rpgs:<blockquote>1.<b>Acceptance</b>(how to build a constructive attitude for interactive imagination, and other intense human interactions)<br/>2.<b>Talking and singing</b>(how to use a normal voice in wonderful ways, and how to make great dialogue simple)<br/>3.<b>Theme dancing</b>(how to introduce theme, frame conflicts and find consequences, and weave intrigues on this basis)<br/>4.<b>Mechanics galore</b>(mechanics from modern games, what points and dice and other fiddly bits to use, and to what purpose)<br/>5.<b>Happiness</b>(the social, emotional and intellectual content of gaming, the heavens of human interaction)</blockquote>I have posted my two first games in Jasons thread.<br/><br/>Here is my game #3:<br/><br/><b>T H E M E - D A N C I N G</b><br/>- how to introduce theme, frame conflicts and find consequences, and weave intrigues on this basis in role-playing games<br/><i><br/>Here you are! So what do you do?<br/><br/>So that is what you do! Well, here is what happens!<br/><br/>Oh, so this is how you react! Very well, then you will experience this!<br/><br/>The experience change you? Good, then you are here! So what do you do?</i><br/><br/>I have, amongst others, been an advocate for the idea that <i>conflict </i>is essential in building theme in role-playing games. It is not. <i>Initiative </i>is, together with <i>consequence</i>, <i>experience </i>and <i>development</i>. This is a fairly simple dance to do, if you take the time and make the right moves. "The right moves", however, demands a certain finesse to be done in tune with the players, the characters and the theme. Dancing is easy, when you know how to follow the music ...<br/><br/>And the "music" of role-playing games grows from interaction and improvisation. To create really great themes for your games, is to join forces in a mutual flow of consciousness. I will not propose to tell you how to do that. Some games have their own way to go towards this goal. Some don't. You will find them!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_204878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204878/#Comment_204878" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-02T04:57:58+00:00" title="May  2, 2009  4:57AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 2, 2009 9:11AM by TomasHVM.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>T H E M E - D A N C I N G</b> (continued)<br/><br/>This is a game for training your abilities to make strong "drama" (from a Greek word meaning "action"; the dealings and moral undercurrent of a narrative). I propose that you go for drama that is serious and realistic. That is the best training you can get. Wild drama with little or no reference to reality can be great fun, but it will provide little <i>training</i>.<br/><br/><b>1 - Introduce theme</b><br/>Sit down around a table and talk. Given the premise that this game is about a serious theme; what do you want to do? Should it be about conflicts in a rich family (family-life), trying to keep a business alive during the depression (business-life), hiking through the wilderness (nature and wildlife), battling a disease as doctors (science, ethics and humanity), or something else? You choose, and note the theme on a central paper on the table. Write it in BIG letters, for all to see.<br/><br/>Choose a time-period for the theme to focus on; ancient (choose a culture), historical (choose a period and a culture) or contemporary (use your own culture). Write it down on the same sheet, and find some key-phrases connecting to the theme, and note them on the sheet. Leave the sheet in the middle of the table, for all to see.<br/><br/>Example: a group of players choose to make their game on the theme of homosexuality. Then they choose the historical time-period, and the Napoleonic era. After noting some key phrases on the sheet it looks like this:\n<blockquote><i><b> Homosexuality </b><br/>Historical; Napoleonic era<br/>- loyalty, soldiers hierachy, life and death struggle, revolution</i></blockquote>They agree that this is something they can relate to, on a serious level, so they go on ...<br/><br/>Now you need to think about what kind of persons that fits into this theme. Each of you take two sheets of paper and note the name and status of two fictional persons. "Status" may be a position in the hierarchy of the theme in any way, f.ex. a title.  Then your share them with your fellow players, and delve into each person one by one, together. Note how he or she relates to the theme, and think about what motivates him/her. Make varied relations and motivations. Some may be honest and hardworking, while others are without scruples. Make all kinds of realistic people. Do not shy away from making dull or mediocre people too. Soem of them may resemble eachother, and some may stand out as singular people, in a bad or good way. Note it all in short entries on the sheets, one-word cues to build on in the game.<br/><br/>You make the fictional persons in this chapter of this training-game, to underline the importance of the human elements on theme. The humans in our story will broaden and deepen the theme, and make it tangible to us as human beings. The persons we create will give actuality to the theme, and make it playable.<br/><br/><i>- Take a break -<br/>When you have done this, it is time to take a small break. Get some grub, open a window, go out. Take 15 minutes at least, or go out for a shared dinner on a nearby restaurant, with the strict rule not to discuss the game. Let the game rest while you do other things. Your unconscious will work on, and prepare you for the game-proper.</i><br/><br/><b>2 - Frame conflicts</b><br/>"Conflicts" in this game are differences in opinion, hierarchical tensions, or conflicting motivations. These "conflicts" may pronounce themselves in varying ways, as the fictional persons of the game reach for their goals.<br/><br/>- You may go through your persons again, and give each of them a goal to reach for, and an action they prefer to use: investigate, maneuver, conserve, build, negotiate or fight. Think on these actions in the broadest sense. Example: to <i>investigate</i> can be used in both the geographical, personal, criminal and scientific sense of the word.<br/><br/>- Now you set up a situation with two or more of your persons. Do this in a dialogue.<br/><br/>1 ---&gt; Let one player set his person in a situation where he is trying to achieve something. He/she will "frame the scene", that is; to place the scene in time and location, and to tell the others what his/her person are trying to do there.<br/><br/>2 ---&gt; Then another player may introduce one of his/her persons, and tell the others how that person relates to the first person in the scene. The new person may be positive and helpful, it may be there for its own reasons, or it may be opposed to the goal of the other one.<br/><br/>3 ---&gt; Start the interplay; each of the players may take intiatives, telling what their person do or say, closing in on some kind of resolution of the scene. This may come quickly, or slow, and it may open up for more persons to enter the scene.<br/><br/>4 ---&gt; If more persons enter the scene, this will be one of the persons made by other players. they will play these new persons, and introduce them in a way that makes sense in the scene, and with the description of their person. If no such person exist, then you have to make one, and let one player take control over it.<br/><br/>5 ---&gt; When a resolution of the scene is called for, you will decide on an outcome, or agree on a method that may produce any of these three; a positive, negative or neutral result. How this will balance is up to you. Take the situation into consideration, and agree on something that suits it. It may be rock-scissors-paper, rolling one or more dice, drawing cards, tossing coins, buying results with beads, or discussing what is the most realistic result of the dealings between the fictional persons.<br/><br/>6 ---&gt; You will not decide on, or narrate, any consequence of the outcome. Determine if there is one or more successes, failures, compromises or neutral happenings that concludes the scene. The flavor/color of the outcome, and the actual consequences, is covered in the next chapter of the game.<br/><b><br/>Keep an open mind on this, be realistic in your approach, and let your game grow on you.</b><br/><i><br/>(to be continued)</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_204879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204879/#Comment_204879" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-02T05:09:05+00:00" title="May  2, 2009  5:09AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will try to finish this "training-game" in a couple of days.

One thing I've noticed is that games where there is a big "building phase" tend to be a bit clunky starting out. I suspect that you are absolutely right that a period of mental "simmering" of that "idea stew" will help with that in a way that going on immediately would not.<br/><br/>2) I also like that you encourage players to create all characters that might be involved, which breaks out of a heroes/villains/extras mindset, leaving events and player judgment to decide what, if any, category a given character falls into after play. I also thought the encouragement to include "dull" characters was a stroke of genius.<br/><br/>3) "6 ---&gt; You will not decide on, or narrate, any consequence of the outcome. Determine if there is one or more successes, failures, compromises or neutral happenings that concludes the scene. The flavor/color of the outcome, and the actual consequences, is covered in the next chapter of the game."<br/><br/>I know you intend to post more, but could you expand briefly on this? I'm having some difficulty with seperating the idea of success/failure from outcomes. It seems (to me) like the two inherently have a direct connection. Where, for example, might I call something as having gone too far from a success/failure and was starting to push into outcome territory?<br/><br/>4) As a training game, how long do you imagine this taking in real time? Are there any time constraints or scene constraints you think should be in place? Basically, what, if any, is the "off-switch" to let particpants know they've finished?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204891/#Comment_204891" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-02T08:23:39+00:00" title="May  2, 2009  8:23AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One other thought:<br/>Looking at this, it seems like you've hit on another key thing that I think is notiicable and important to teach about S-G games:<br/><br/>Players, the actual people, aren't "frozen out" of participation due to fictional events.<br/><br/>I don't know if that was part of the intended training, but I consider it a big part of S-Gs that is very different from other rpgs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_204898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204898/#Comment_204898" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-02T09:04:23+00:00" title="May  2, 2009  9:04AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 2, 2009 3:31PM by TomasHVM.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Robert! Good feedback this!<br/><br/>1 - the "simmering" pause is important; it cools down the "boiling" connected with building the framework, and give room for a calmer mindset, better suited to focused interplay.<br/><br/>2 - my idea in "make all characters beforehand, also the dull ones", is to loosen up in the pro- and antagonist-dualism, and to open the playing field for all sorts of characters, and all sorts of interplay.<br/><br/>3 - This being a "teaching game" I want the players to focus on one thing at a time. I know this is a high order in certain groups and fictions. It may need som e clarification, so let us try to address it before I write the next chapter <b>(I don't have the time right now, so anyone may give it a try)</b>.<br/><br/>4 - I have no clue to how long this will take. I don't want to speculate. I never do, unless it is a role-playing poem, when doing the first design of a game.<br/><br/>The other thought: let's try to make this a training game with lots of openings for player participation, and with easy tools for players re-entering the fiction. It will make the training the more effective, and it will, as Robert says, reflect an important element of S-G games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_204934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204934/#Comment_204934" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-02T15:40:45+00:00" title="May  2, 2009  3:40PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 2, 2009 3:43PM by TomasHVM.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would very much like to get some feedback on the action the players may attach to their fictional persons: <b>investigate, maneuver, conserve, build, negotiate or fight</b>.

Is all great role-playing built on good intentions towards each other, beautiful interplay, and truthful consequences? Is it possible to establish these virtues/ideas/graces (?) as objective goals for all role-playing?
