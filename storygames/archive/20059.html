I'm kinda new to these boards and I generally just design RPGs for me and my online friends to mess around with. But I thought I'd try my hand at releasing something to the public. I would love to start my own company one day and I was hoping I could get some input. <br/><br/>The game <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0rQNwd22ivsSE1GTERMcEZIUHc/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0rQNwd22ivsSE1GTERMcEZIUHc/view?usp=sharing</a> is called <b>Ghosts Like Us.</b> where you take on the role of a haunting entity at some sort of property trying to scare away (among other motivations) the new inhabitants using your <i>ghostly powers</i>. Not a lot of stats, super rules light. More a comedy story-telling game than what someone thinks of when they talk table-top. It's completely unplayed, untested, but I liked the idea of not having dice or a GM. <br/><br/>I'd really like input. Whats good, whats bad, if you'd like to play and let me know how it plays that would be cool too. So far I havent seen anything out there like this. But to be honest it was a single days work so my feelings wont be hurt if it crumbles to dust. haha.

So you could divide it into sets of scenes like fiasco if that's your taste. <br/><br/>Yeah the design is much to be desired hah  I'm still learning. As for the mechanics i like the check boxes too. I think it would work really well maybe i can throw that in as well. But as for the core mechanic, i left it like that since it's a comedy game, playing the fails might be an opportunity to make something funny happen. But even if you don't like playing the fails, there's an element of strategy there. You could always push the scene more towards something you don't care about just to fail on purpose. Like if you want to try to befriend the psychic little boy who moved in, you can spend your fails on that top be a total dick to him.

I think this is nice if you can use it as an <i>additional</i> mechanic, i.e. like in Fate, where you can use self-compels to collect Fate points (as bonus points).<br/>However, if the <i>core mechanics</i> constantly forces you to play fails, this may get tiresome and eventually wear down the comedic element.<br/><br/>If you want to stick to the coin mechanics, here is another idea:<br/>- Conflicts are resolved via coin flipping.<br/>- Your ghost has a "coin pool" that it can additionally use to turn around fails (2 coins for certain succcess; 1 coin for a 're-roll')<br/>- Your ghost can add a coin to its pool when it 'intentionally fails' a situation<br/><br/>You will eventually find out through playtesting how it works best.<br/>Keep us posted how it goes!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443599/#Comment_443599" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-03T14:07:06+00:00" title="March  3, 2015  2:07PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 3, 2015 2:08PM by Rickard.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> Like if you want to try to befriend the psychic little boy who moved in, you can spend your fails on that top be a total dick to him.

If this is how you want the game to be, perhaps you can have two different tables of suggestions where one is about helping the occupants while one is terrorizing them. Perhaps the humans doesn't need any stats, but goals or other kinds of desires?<br/><br/>I like the original mechanic with coins, and I would playtest it first before I change it, if I were you. What I think you need to think through is HOW the game is going to be played and then form mechanics around it. Right now, it seems like you created a mechanic and formed play around it. I guess it works too. It depends on what you think is more important: the theme of the game or the gameplay. (I do either one in different projects, truth be told, because it depends on what I want with the game.) If you want to focus on the gameplay, then come up with a reason why someone would not like to flip all the coins in one scene, or what it means for the others - or the story - to flip the coins.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ferninja" title="Ferninja"><img alt="Ferninja" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/663/n5I0JAA0QAU5X.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ferninja">Ferninja</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443600/#Comment_443600" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-03T14:49:56+00:00" title="March  3, 2015  2:49PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh i see what you're saying.

Like you can always just opt not to use your fails since they will all be successes again next round. Or if you so choose you can use the fails to basically get "extra" successes.

You have 7776 combinations to play. That's quite a lot.<br/>Plus, I use random tables always as an inspiration, not as a rigid framework.

But, my thinking behind that was my experience with the game Paranoia. It is a collaborative game, but the players directly compete and even actively betray one another. Ive only ever seen it work in a comedy system. I do like the idea of turning humans into a sort of narrative element rather than a mechanical one. Maybe checkboxes would work, but I think 'll take your advice and not change anything until I get a chance to play test it.<br/><br/>And for the other posts, I'm going to agree with BeePeeGee on that one. There are a whole mess of potential combinations, and even if none of those were your thing, you could always not use them and create your own. Nothing in the RPG world is written in stone. I created them more as thinking points than concrete rules.\n<blockquote><br/>I like d6 tables - like in John Harper's <i>Lasers &amp; Feelings</i> - as a quick inspiration to get the setting started. <br/></blockquote>\nAnd I love lasers and feelings! I played actually shortly before creating this. But my main reason for creating this game was to aschew the whole die rolling thing and coming up with a silly system where players have to choose when to hold em and when to fold em. I wanted to take the GM out of it.

Of course. I'm a big fan of rpgs. It would be inappropriate for the game to have many of the features that paranoia has. I was merely replying to Rickard ls statement that competitive play is counter productive to the reason everyone cones to the table so i thought it would be a good example.

Really surprising. I'm stoked to see where it leads and what design space it opens up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
