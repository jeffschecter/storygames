Seriously, it's completely killing my desire to facilitate any sort of rpg night any more.<br/><br/>To be fair, this is an issue that's very explicitly restricted to a couple of my players. Frankly I think the issue is (lack of) trust and hypercompetitiveness: They're afraid that the moment two players enter a conflict, it's not only a fight to the death but also utter destruction of whatever facade of friendship they might have had outside the game as well. That is perhaps melodramatic. But it's how it feels from where I'm sitting.<br/><br/>So both these guys have begun to insist, nay <i>demand</i>, that we restrict their play to team-oriented stuff. They're perfectly fine directing their energies toward defeating whatever the GM cooks up, but God help the GM who wants to play facilitator and not Chief Punching Bag. Give them a mission and they're good to go. Give them a mission upon which to hang their personal character stories, the <i>second</i> those character stories take up more spotlight time than the mission, they get jettisoned as "irrelevant to completing the mission."<br/><br/>I look at team-oriented, mission-driven play and all I see is shitty fiction. I see weird, artificial stuff about niche protection and character build optimization, snuffing out any hope of individual character desires or interesting drama. I see the total destruction of any sort of self-actualization in the game -- wouldn't be good for the party, now, would it? *rollseyes* What I don't see, unfortunately, is any desire to play out the best team/mission stories in regular fiction: team members with conflicting agendas, team members who are loyal to each other but cannot rely on that loyalty, missions that put the team to the test, etc.<br/><br/>As a GM, I think I'm really goddamned good at neutrally facilitating play. My strong suit is setting up provocative situations where players can make statements about their characters through their decisions. Half my Group A players love this -- I mean really, really love it. My entire Group B appreciates this. For those guys, this is the Golden Age of roleplaying. For the other half, their reactions to my desire for them to "make statements" range from itchy discomfort to outright anger. The anger is the most surprising, and dismaying, reaction I can count on. How do you get pissed off <i>playing a game</i>? They must think we're all playing a different game, or we're playing it wrong.<br/><br/>I think this has been building for some time.<br/><br/>In reaction to my second, sadly unsuccessful, go at <i>Dust Devils</i> the other night, one of my players suggested he run <i>Cyberpunk</i>. I literally got sick to my stomach at the thought of it. Already I can hear the discussion of which guys should carry which kinds of cyberwear, and how to ensure we have an airtight spread of abilities so the GM can't screw us.<br/><br/>So I come to you asking for help: Help me not hate "teams." How do you build team-oriented, mission-focused play that alleviates the PVP fear (or whatever the fuck is going on), without crushing any hope I may have of individual stories and character-driven play?<br/><br/>p.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138613/#Comment_138613" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-07T18:22:25+00:00" title="April  7, 2008  6:22PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a tough situation, because in fiction, a well-functioning team is like a loaded gun.  No gun should go unfired, and no team should go untested.  But these players are telling you they don't enjoy it when the team is tested.  <br/><br/>I think you're taking the right approach here, trying to find a way to get what you want out of the game, without making the game all about stuff these guys obviously hate.  <br/><br/>Here's my best shot:<br/><br/>When a team starts out as a functional, compatable unit, the most interesting thing that can happen is that something comes along which threatens that harmony.  The more these guys work together, the more your GM instinct tells you to drive a wedge between them.  There's interesting play there, and it drives a lot of game sessions.<br/><br/>When two characters start out at complete odds, as total enemies, the most interesting thing that can happen is that something comes along which forces them to work together.  My advice would be to talk to these guys about creating two characters who are at odds, and then seeing how well they can make them work together.  The interesting stuff then happens when the characters are working together, not when they're driven apart.  You can talk this out beforehand, so that you all know that it's safe, and they're not <i>really</i> going to be working at odds.  The interesting stuff is happening where you all want it to - when they're working together.  The trick to this is to make it so they never get comfortable together.  As soon as they decide they're actually working well as a team, you've got to throw something in that drives them apart again, and that's going to bring it all crashing down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138617/#Comment_138617" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-07T18:54:11+00:00" title="April  7, 2008  6:54PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dammit Paul, just give them the team-based, mission-oriented gaming already.<br/><br/>And charge them real money for doing so.<br/><br/>Or just plain tell them _you_ aren't enjoying GMing that kind of stuff all the time. <br/><br/>If these guys are your pals, they'll help you find a solution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138623/#Comment_138623" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-07T19:33:06+00:00" title="April  7, 2008  7:33PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 7, 2008 7:33PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My group also loves teams.  Hell, <b>I</b> love teams.  All the bad experiences I had as a kid with dysfunctional intra-PC relationships, all the goddamn boring Mexican standoffs, all the divisive and petty one-upsmanship, all the lame and predictable melodrama, all the backstabbing and note-passing and "I stab the paladin when he's asleep" bullshit...I'm just over it.  I remember 1988 well enough and I don't need to relive it.  But seeing PCs working together, reserving the "serious" stakes for external conflicts and keeping the stories of the main characters largely supportive of each other (maybe with a little surface friction, but always pulling together in-character when the chips are down, always with the players being concerned out-of-character about including and supporting everyone else's efforts)...that's fun stuff!  That's the kind of thing that makes me feel good about playing a game with my friends!<br/><br/><br/>So, here's my advice in a nutshell:  either figure out what you can love about a cooperative, team-based game, or bow out gracefully and tell someone else to run a cooperative, team-based game to meet the needs of group A without you.  If you genuinely can't enjoy running or playing in the style of game that they like, then don't: be honest with them about why you can't have fun the way they have fun, and step aside.  It's really your only option -- the odds of you magically converting them to players who like to have their characters working at cross purposes is basically nil.  (They know what they like and they've been telling you what they like, and that's something you should thank them for instead of telling them that you hate their preferences and think it can only produce "shitty fiction."  Seriously, man, that's not cool.)<br/><br/><br/>You might -- <i>might</i> -- be able to generate the kind of interpersonal antagonism that you crave by farming out antagonist NPCs to the gang, so as to allow the players to really square off against each other (which they <i>might</i> enjoy) without forcing their characters to butt heads (which they definitely do NOT enjoy).  And maybe that would take some of the "Chief Punching Bag" heartbreak away, too.  Or play in a smaller group -- with only two or maybe three players, the competition for "spotlight time" is much less intense and there's a lot more room for personal stories without anyone feeling like they're wasting everyone else's time.  Or negotiate a settlement -- the people who like playing teams make their characters a team, but the non-team-players can do their own thing.<br/><br/>Or (and personally, I think this is a really long shot, but whatever) you could try to take deliberate and highly-telegraphed baby steps towards less cohesive "teams."  Use analogies:  "This game, we're all like 'The A-Team' -- BA and Murdock work together fine when the bad guys are shooting but <i>never</i> get along under any other circumstances."  "This game, we're like 'Dexter' -- we're working the same case, but everyone's got their own agenda, from stealing the credit to covering up their own crimes, and we're going to have fun with seeing how everyone approaches the same task from different perspectives."  "Okay, now let's try 'Reservoir Dogs' on for size -- you're a team in name only, and apart from the ONE TASK that you had to do as a team, you'd gleefully shoot each other in the face."  Slowly work your way from optimal teams down to dysfunctional ones, and then see if it makes it easier to take that final step and abolish teams altogether...or maybe just luck out and find the intermediate level where you get enough of what you like without having to shit on what they like, and vice versa.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138624/#Comment_138624" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-07T19:40:03+00:00" title="April  7, 2008  7:40PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 7, 2008 7:40PM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>Or (and personally, I think this is a really long shot, but whatever) you could try to take deliberate and highly-telegraphed baby steps towards less cohesive "teams."

Have you seen the best action movie of the last 10 years (second to The Matrix), <b>BLADE 2</b>? It's about Blade and his boys, and the vampire elite team training to kill him. But now they must work together towards a common goal. And yet, there's a lot of tension.<br/><br/>Now, take out the stuff about "there must be a deceiver/spy/traitor", and make the conflicts not so "When Blade isn't looking, I Kill Him" (but rather have them be ideological enemies, like two very different government agencies: CIA Black Ops (trained military professionals) vs Parks and Wildlife (intelligent and skilled hippies) ). I did this in Delta Green games, and it was a total riot... well, not just comedicly funny, but it really brought the tension when the folks were in character.<br/><br/>But in the end, you might have a few guys that just aren't on the same page. That's cool, they know what they like, you know what you like, and you'all know that you'll never get there, even by forcing. <br/><br/>Actually, that "...tension when the folks were in character" got me thinking for a sec... When you actually play these games, do the folks you're having problems with (the ones who get angry) actually get out and talk in character and the like, engaging in dialogue as that character, etc? Or did they seem to ride it out behind the character sheet ("My guy tactically does X. My guy threatens Z", etc). I've noticed a little bit of the behavior you described at times: I'm not a big "NGS" guy, but I found that this was clearly a difference between:<br/>People who liked to get into character (really play the role) and people who didn't like getting into character as much (finding it embarrassing, etc).<br/>Among people who like to get into character, I've found that there's some people that have the "My guy would never do that" or "my guy is always acting like a dick. But it's not ME, it's just my CHARACTER"... but those are other problems entirely. When you describe the behaviors above, I'm brought back to the players I've played with in some local groups who loved the fighting, loved the teamwork, loved the surprises and the plot twists... but for some reason just never wanted to talk in character or really get into the role, other than saying a few lines to the guy selling weapons.<br/><br/>I was just curious on that point.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138628/#Comment_138628" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-07T20:16:11+00:00" title="April  7, 2008  8:16PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 7, 2008 8:23PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>When you describe the behaviors above, I'm brought back to the players I've played with in some local groups who loved the fighting, loved the teamwork, loved the surprises and the plot twists... but for some reason just never wanted to talk in character or really get into the role, other than saying a few lines to the guy selling weapons.</blockquote>\nFor whatever it's worth, my (highly team-positive) group is full of people who really love talking in character and getting into the role, and I think that's part of <i>why</i> most of them love teamwork better than intra-PC conflict.  We're all friends outside the game and most of us have fairly high-stress jobs, full of conflict and touchy personalities and people getting pissed off, so my perception is that no one really wants to make their weekend leisure time focus on negativity, too.  I think everyone values that four hours of cheerful, amicable friendship so much that PC-vs-PC struggles just come off as harshing the zen.<br/><br/>Goofy arguments between PCs (like BA Baracus doing his "I ain't gettin' on no helicopter!" rant) are encouraged in our games, but expressions of genuine animosity between characters are definitely not.  It means that we probably can never play neck-stabbing tour de forces like IAWA, but oh well -- our games are totally goddamn awesome already, so we're obviously not missing much.  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138642/#Comment_138642" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-08T02:24:26+00:00" title="April  8, 2008  2:24AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude, you want to run <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>, and they want <em>Stargate</em>.

It sounds like those folks have an established style of play that they really enjoy.  They understand that you want to introduce some elements that they're not accustomed to and not comfortable with and they're just not digging it.  So they come to the table wanting to play but they see half their "teammates" hopping on board with what you're pitching and they feel the frustration you're having with them not complying.  Suddenly it looks like you're telling them that <i>they're</i> playing it wrong.  When it comes down to it, they're being asked to do something that they're uncomfortable with (which is embarrassing) and others at the table are getting frustrated with them for not complying.  Anger is a pretty natural defensive reaction in that scenario.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138657/#Comment_138657" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-08T06:06:06+00:00" title="April  8, 2008  6:06AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris is right, which is why talking about the situation is going to range from difficult to counter-productive. I don't know that I've ever heard a successful report where somebody said, "Well I talked to the guys with the other agenda, and now they play the way I like!" <br/>\n<br/>\nAs I always say about this situation, show, don't tell. Play a game that has a system that's going to show them how it could be fun to play the way which you're interested in playing. And no offense to Matt, but Dust Devils is not it. Dust Devils is actually pretty subtle about these things, and one could as easily play a tight posse as have any intra-PC conflict. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor my money, it sounds like they're pretty competitive, and maybe use the game to blow off steam (like, apparently, Accounting's group does). If so, show them a functional game about PVP competition. Try Agon. <br/>\n<br/>\nSomething like this might show them that they can compete and have fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nNote that the deeper issue is not with "PvP" or anything like that. It's that the players see the game as a challenge for them to personally overcome. Or that's what it sounds like. Gamism, basically. You want Narrativism out of them. Pretty classic. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAccounting... at the risk of causing the sort of ire that I'm predicting above, I'm interested in your description of the way in which you came to the style of play that you now enjoy, a style that took you 20 years to get to today. You point out that it is strictly a reaction to dysfunctional play caused by an incoherence in the views that the players had about the way in which you played way back then. Some seeing it as being a co-operative endeavor, some seeing it as competitive, some seeing it as "what my guy would do." <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I agree with you that - barring being able to show them how to have a good time with another system - Paul should just bow out, you're not saying that there's no functional way to play with inter-PC conflicts, right? At the further risk of sounding defensive, you're not suspecting that the way that many of us play here is neccessarily faulty, are you? It sounds a little that way. Like you feel that we've merely deluded ourselves into silently accepting the badness of dysfunctional PVP play. <br/>\n<br/>\nOr do you have a good idea of how functional intra-PC conflict works. How it's CvC, and not PvP at all, right? How players can actually *facilitate* each other's play in a very fun way by having their character conflict with the other players'. The same way that the GM facilitates play by putting complications in the way of the other players. <br/>\n<br/>\nOr does all of that sound like cheap talk to you? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul, it sounds to me like you're trying to sneak up on the mode of play that you're interested in, to slowly insinuate the sort of play you'd like to see by giving just the right sort of mission. Sorry, but I'm very skeptical that this will work at all. In fact, it sounds like you've already tried this, and as you note the players reject these opportunities for character development if they are at all at the expense of potential mission success. They're dedicated to their gamism. Sans showing them a game that makes it obvious how the other agenda is also fun, why would they change? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt also sounds like you're suffering from one of the Geek Fallacies (or, rather, the group is as a whole), namely that since this group has always played together, that they always should continue to play together, suffering through problems of incoherent play no matter how much it sucks. Maybe it's just time for a change. Split the two members of group A who like the way you play, and the members of group B into new groups C and D. Maybe bring in some new blood. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138671/#Comment_138671" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-08T08:22:26+00:00" title="April  8, 2008  8:22AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2008 8:24AM by JDCorley.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>For whatever it's worth, my (highly team-positive) group is full of people who really love talking in character and getting into the role, and I think that's part of<i>why</i>most of them love teamwork better than intra-PC conflict.

I'm feeling a little silly and more than a little dramatic about the whole thing. I'm still exploring in myself why I had such a visceral reaction at the thought of atavistic play; probably the same reason my two outliers have such a visceral reaction at the thought of <i>character development</i> and <i>exploration of themes</i>.<br/><br/>Everything in this thread is absolutely reasonable and, of course, has been repeated and echoed around the web for years and years now. I know all this stuff. I do. But it's also really good to hear it all again.<br/><br/>New blood: Honestly I couldn't take any more blood! I've got two very active, viable groups, maybe 12 people total I can tap almost at any time for any kind of gaming I'd ever want. 1.5 of those groups are having the time of their lives. The 0.5 guys are the ones digging in their heels. My short-term solution: Back off on RPing nights when those guys are involved, and do other kinds of gaming (their board/card/video game tastes are well established so it's very easy to keep everyone entertained). I won't tolerate being whined at, and that's what my outliers are fundamentally doing.<br/><br/>I do think there's fertile ground within the concept of "team". I mean, we've had a grand time playing Lacuna -- but only because it can be a fun puzzle to solve. I don't believe I'll ever see agent-on-agent violence in Lacuna unless Control orders one of them to shoot an agent. We had a good time with InSpectres as well.<br/><br/>The Stargate vs. BSG example made me smile, because that's precisely the matchup that was in my head. On that note, my <i>personal</i> perfect "team" dynamic would probably be something along the lines of Farscape: Everyone's forced together and have mutual interests, but individual agendas also crop up and threaten the team. Seven Samurai is in this vein as well. <br/><br/>Andy: Terrific question. They'll argue in-character but, in-character, the emotions get amped up fast until it's obvious that it's the player's emotions, not the character's, we're feeling at the table. Author-stance play is, frankly, a deal-breaker for one of my two most ardent team/mission players. When a system requires they do so (<i>Burning Wheel, Dust Devils</i>), that's when he gets angriest. In DD, a player sided with an NPC in a conflict between that NPC and one of my team/mission players. The team/mission player took it as a <i>personal slight</i> that the player helped an "enemy" NPC and won, thereby causing his character Harm, thereby fucking up his effectiveness. i.e. "your helping that NPC was mechanically identical to shooting my character yourself." <br/><br/>So...IMO they'll play in-character but not in-character with any sort of emotional investment. They'll go along with it when they're RPing with an NPC.<br/><br/>Teasing this apart, I think I've got a good profile on my two team/mission players:<br/><br/>T/M <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> has a social-contract problem with any sort of conflict outside what he feels is the "okay" one with the GM. PvP is not acceptable.<br/><br/>T/M <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is strongly competitive, and would happily go PvP against everyone...so long as he's winning due to tactical decisions. Tactical victories are okay, character-driven victories (I lost the fight but I stood by my ideals!) are not. This means he enters conflicts on a completely different basis than everyone else. In DD, he "won" his conflicts when he got more chips than everyone else, for example.<br/><br/>And, KBob, of course you're right about all that (again). This is all talkable with my folks; we'll figure something out.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138703/#Comment_138703" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-08T11:00:25+00:00" title="April  8, 2008 11:00AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2008 11:02AM by lachek.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why is nobody bringing this up?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>I think the issue is (lack of) trust and hypercompetitiveness: They're afraid that the moment two players enter a conflict, it's not only a fight to the death but also utter destruction of whatever facade of friendship they might have had outside the game as well.</blockquote>\nThis is an echo of a situation I went through with one of my groups about six months ago. Two players in the group had obvious personality conflicts and problems in their personal life. It occasionally came up as snide remarks at the game table, and more often in out-of-game conversation where the other player was not present, but usually there was a facade of strained politeness in place.<br/><br/>At one point, perfectly reasonable fictional events led to an in-character overreaction, and guns came out. You could tell the players in question, who were also among the instigators, were visibly distressed. Push came to shove with some MyGuyisms, and one character got their arm blown off. Some heated out of character discussion later accompanied with some backpedaling weirdness, and suddenly the fiction has been rewound and altered such that the argument never happened. After the session, the player whose character got their arm blown off stressed how he really doesn't like inter-party conflicts, how he loves Shadowrun and mission-oriented RP, and so on. He never came back to that group, but joined us with a different set of people who play <i>anything but</i>, and is loving it.<br/><br/>The other player, whom we still play with in that group, has since stopped a game of The Shab-Al-Hiri Roach mid-session and canceled a scheduled game of Paranoia because she "hates competitive games". Yet, her <i>character</i> seems to have no problem competing with others - in a sample of four, none of them have been particularly friendly with other "party members", and are often overtly antisocial and cruel with the requisite systematic backup in terms of Disadvantages, Traits etc.<br/><br/>Judging from my own experiences, could it be possible - given the quote above - that you're not dealing with players who love team play, but players with such bad relationships with the rest of the players that they cannot handle even a fictional conflict between them? Or in Mike Holmes' terms, to prevent the bad blood which Nar play might reveal, they want to strictly immerse themselves in the rules of the Game?<br/><br/>Team play can be cool, but as Simon said, a fully functional and cohesive team makes for bad fiction. More commonly, the team's goal is a McGuffin for revealing the fiction which lies within the team itself. If your players have issues with each other, these issues will arise and ruin any game, whether it's constrained by artificial cohesion or not.<br/><br/>Perhaps this will help. Ask yourself if the players who "favour team play" actually play as a team - that is, their characters enthusiastically interact with others in a positive way - or if they play solo, and interactions with other characters are mostly dismissive or negative? If they actually interact in a positive, excited way with others in a team environment, then the suggestions others have given above are gold. If they try to play solo, and ignore other players, then they're not into team play at all, they just want to hide their social flaws behind a game system. This latter will probably mess up your game regardless, and all the team play advice in the world won't help.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138706/#Comment_138706" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-08T11:05:27+00:00" title="April  8, 2008 11:05AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>While I agree with you that - barring being able to show them how to have a good time with another system - Paul should just bow out, you're not saying that there's no functional way to play with inter-PC conflicts, right?</blockquote>\nRight.

Often when we play with CvC conflict, the results of the conflict are resolved amicably. Just as they are in a lot of the samples you give. There's no requirement in this sort of play that players actually have their characters decide to work against the others. <br>\n<br>\nThere just has to be the possibility that it could happen. Without that real possibility, there's no tension to this part of the fiction. And I'd posit that most of this fiction does have such tensions. Take the continual frission in the Magnificent Seven between the gold-digger character, and Chris, who he assumes is hiding some "real" motive for going on the mission. This doesn't prevent them from being successful at all, but it even plays out with Chris lying to the other character on his deathbed, to ease the other character's conscience about being a fool for coming along and dying. <br>\n<br>\nThat's some of the most powerful stuff of the movie. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, know what the most powerful moment of the movie is for me? The part where Bronson's character tells the Mexican boys that the real heroes are their fathers, because their fathers have something to lose and real fear in their lives, and yet persevere. How does that moment help them win the mission, him teaching the kids that lesson? <br/>\n<br/>\n"But, wait..." you say. "That's not intra-character frission." No, it's not. That part is a red herring here, truth be told. Intra-character conflict isn't at all a neccessary part of this sort of play. What Paul is really looking for, and which he just didn't indicate as strongly (though you'll see it in his original post), is that he's simply looking for any thematic play. That includes the potential to have PC vs PC conflict, sure, but doesn't require it. What it requires is that the players be making decisions based on something more that what will win the scenario. That is, they're making the decisions as if the characters had to balance out their values, which might sometimes mean going against the mission. <br/>\n<br/>\nNote *might.* There's no reason why they can't often or always choose the mission over the other value. Heck, the conflicts or themes in question may be completely tangential to the mission. Now, you might ask, "well what's the difference between that, and what my group does?" Well, maybe nothing, but the real question is whether or not there's a real chance that the player may have the character do something tactically unsound in order to value something personal other than the mission. And that means that it's likely that at some point they do something of this sort, even if only infrequently. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut you can tell when you play. If a player says something like, "Why kill the baby kobolds? Because they aren't worth any experience points alive, duh!" thats a good indicator that the player isn't interested at all in the moral dilemmas or the pressures that the character might feel in making them, but is solely interested in beating the mission. Yeah, loaded example, but you take my meaning, one can tell which sort of play it is, and for some the one or the other is incompatible. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's this dividing like that Paul is staring down (he'll correct me if I'm wrong). On the one side lies party unity, as they strive as players to ignore their character's peccaddillos and simply win the game. On the other side lies players working with each other to create a plot that's full of tension, including the possibility (though not requirement) of defection. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138726/#Comment_138726" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-08T12:30:23+00:00" title="April  8, 2008 12:30PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On genre: actually, for the players in question, genre is an utterly irrelevant concern when it comes to their desire to be in a team.

I should probably unpack the situation a bit further.<br/><br/>Paul wants thematic play -- I want my players to make decisions about their characters that are about the characters, not about the player's desire to beat the GM's maze.<br/><br/>Paul's group mostly wants the same thing. Joy and happiness.<br/><br/>Unhappy player <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> is freaked out by PvP/CvC conflict. This shuts the door on the possibility of character-driven play done in good faith. If I'm asking for character-driven play, the character must be the reason for any and all conflicts. Declaring certain elements as out-of-bounds (i.e. other PCs) fucks up good-faith character-driven play. His default fallback play position is strongly Gamist: I can't "win" conflicts I won't enter, but I *can* "win" conflicts where the victory conditions are of my own choosing. Example: winning chips in <i>Dust Devils</i>, without the need to spend them to further his character-driven play.<br/><br/>Unhappy player <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is the hardcore capital-G gamist. Very smart guy. But, without a clear mission, he doesn't know how to "win". In addition, he will not generate his own victory conditions, like UP#1 does. Every conflict must be a tactical challenge set out by the GM, which results in a) highly reactive play, and b) total blindness to the possibilities of character-driven play. I can couch character-driven play in Gamist terms but it doesn't work right. DD example: I say, You "win" when you make your final statement about your character. His response would be, But I can make that statement whenever I want! Where's the challenge? And he's right.<br/><br/>NB: I'm not at all beating up on DD here.

Certainly there are groups where it is bad form, and this may be one of them since the players described in the OP don't like to give up spotlight time to things unrelated to the mission, but there's no need for physically separated storylines to be completely a tangent from other goals...<br/><br/>Anyway, I like your distinction, and especially Mike Holmes' clarification too.  But as for practical advice, I think komradebob's questions are the gold in this thread, indeed, my group (HEAVILY team oriented) has improved dramatically since I have made those questions explicit during campaign/character design, then "checked in" with them a few sessions into play, and every so often thereafter.  "Are you getting the team dynamic you want? Are other characters dealing with yours the way you, the player, want them to?" and so on.<br/><br/>My wife and I love having characters that bicker constantly.  But others in the group eventually get annoyed at that (for a lot of reasons, some of which have to do with mission effectiveness), usually long before we're done being amused. Matter of taste, see.

This is classic D&amp;D play.  The GM comes up with all sorts of details that may or may not ever come up in game, railroads the players (who are willingly railroaded), and *is* out to screw them.  Hence you end up with the hour-long planning scenes trying to cover every contingency so they *can't* be screwed over.<br/><br/>They want to play WoW.  I'm guessing they never see anything of their character beyond numbers on a sheet.  And <i>they like it that way</i>.<br/><br/>Personally, I don't like it and have inter- and intra-character developments even in D&amp;D, whether or not it forwards the plot.  I once had a character who made off with all the loot at the end of the adventure.  She was a thief, what did you expect?<br/><br/>However, here's a question for Paul: do they always play the same "character" no matter what game they're playing?  Or do they stay within the strictures of the "class"?  e.g. a thief would steal, but a paladin would toe the letter of the law and insist others would, too.<br/><br/>For me, a game is all about character development, growth, change, whether it's D&amp;D or InSpectres or Polaris.  There are lots for whom this isn't the case.  The big leap for me actually happened with Polaris and The Roach: I was telling a story, not "fighting" for my character.  <i>I could let bad things happen to my character and still create a great story!</i>  This was really hard at first, but I have settled into it nicely.  Still, there are people who don't want to play games like that, whatever the reason, and so I say, let them play D&amp;D, Shadowrun, etc..<br/><br/>Lots of thoughts,<br/><br/>--Nancy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138774/#Comment_138774" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-08T18:48:19+00:00" title="April  8, 2008  6:48PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, Jesus, Paul.

That's my current plan.<br/><br/>Here's my dilemma: I think my POV on this may actually be wrong. I look at the team/mission-focused play these guys crave and my gut reaction is to sneer at it in contempt. <i>I'm contemptuous of some of my players' RPing styles and preferences.</i> That can't be healthy. I know it's not a healthy perspective. And yet here I am, looking at this looming plan for one of my unhappy players to run his Cyberpunk game, and shaking my head in wonder at what the point of it would be. Rather than getting excited at the possibility of kitting out my guy with guns and 'warez, the very first thing I think is, "This is fucking retarded." And for that, I suck.<br/><br/>That's bad thinking on my part, and I totally acknowledge that. So I think to myself, well, maybe there's a way to triangulate between what they want and what I want. That's a possibility in most other human endeavors; why can't it be be possible in an RPG? Are our play agendas so utterly incompatible that there simply is no compromise possible?<br/><br/>So one big part of me starting this thread at all was to help me walk through my bad attitude and find the halfway point with my other guys. This thread has accomplished that in some ways. I've never bought the "never the twain shall meet" attitude I find in Big Model talk, so I'm sort of discarding the absolutist positions. <br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138784/#Comment_138784" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-08T20:40:48+00:00" title="April  8, 2008  8:40PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2008 8:43PM by Johnstone.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The reason you are "contemptuous" of their play style is because you have to play with them!

That doesn't necessarily prevent you from having fun, though - it just means you have to adopt a different agenda to have fun. Story time (again)!<br/><br/>One of the guys I play crazy hippie indie games with regularly once professed his great love for Castles &amp; Crusades. I encouraged him to run it for our group, despite the fact that all my experiences with D&amp;D up to that point had been filled with loathing and contempt. But this guy was clearly on the same wave length with me, I appreciate his feedback and he appreciates mine, and he was obviously really excited about C&amp;C - there must be <i>something</i> there for him to feel that way.<br/><br/>I rolled (yes, rolled - no point buy crap) up a weakling wizard with the dreaded Sleep spell, we had a couple of half-orcs (one buff barbarian and one cigar-smoking cleric) and an Indiana Jones style thief. We went into a village. The mayor told us of an evil gnoll who forces them to pay tribute, and how there's a reward if we kill him. We spent the first session <i>trying to find the dungeon</i>. The DM was visibly distressed over this, but he was slavishly following a module, and felt his hands were tied. If he had just written in the dungeon location somewhere on the map where we happened to be, he would have been "cheating". He apologized for this, and we carried on our search.<br/><br/>Our second session was spent pushing a heavy table around the dungeon, which we used to barricade the doors between encounters so we could take a breather every now and then. We explored a dozen empty storage closets, tried to figure out the purpose of the blood-stained statue, figured out a Cunning Plan (tm) to defeat a room full of savage wolves, and used barrels of burning oil to great effect. Only on the third session did we kill the gnoll and return to the village to collect our reward.<br/><br/>No character development. No back stories. No plot twists or betrayals. No lead-ins to some epic campaign. No fecking "story". Just a group of ass-kicking level 1 adventurers trying to collect a bounty.<br/><br/>Where was the fun in that? It was fun to try to defeat the module (note, in this case, not the DM - the <i>module</i>). It was fun to do occasional characterizations. It was fun to make plans and strategize out-of-character, although we did make conscious attempts to minimize time spent on this. It was fun to not have to worry too much about the character dying - none of us were very invested in our characters, knowing we could just roll up another in 15 minutes time if need be.<br/><br/>I had to consciously put myself into this frame of mind - when I'm playing C&amp;C, I'm not playing the way I usually do, I'm playing a team-based tactical game of beat-the-module while doing occasional characterizations. If I expect to get character growth or a good story out of a session like that, as I usually do, I will be sorely disappointed. Also, this is a mode of play I can only handle in small doses. It does not deliver the thing I normally crave out of RPGs. As such, if I were you, I would insist that games were cycled on a regular basis to ensure everyone could get a taste for their agenda preference now and then. If you have to adjust to them half the time, they should have to adjust to you half the time, too.<br/><br/>Does that help, Paul?

You said, I don't like to GM party-play and they said, alright, I'll GM. Or at least, that is what I am inferring from your post.<br/>\n  I am one of those guys who like party play, maybe if I can tell you what I am looking for, you can better manage a synthesis:<br/>\nLikes:<br/>\nI like to have fun with my friends and tension between players is not fun (this is probably best identified as "No one gets hurt" play as opposed to "I will not leave you" play), so you might be able to encourage this sort of PC interplay with a social contract. The problem I have with a lot of Nar players, is they don't like to discuss Social Contract overtly and they sometimes are unwilling to accept your boundaries.<br/>\nI do like playing a complex character when its supported by the system and the GM. Aqnd this might be part of your issue, it could be that your players have tried to make a complex character who played to their background and were either defeated by the System, GM or both.<br/>\nWhen done well, Team Play solves a lot of problems (how do the chars know each other, why do they trust each other, etc).<br/>\nThe most fun I have is when 2 or 3 things are happening at once and it ends up they were all related in a fun and interesting way<br/>\nI do like table-talk, kibitzing and socializing at the game table<br/>\nI do like making a difference in the setting (when characters like Elminster or Mask of Winters exist to be the most powerful, influential, etc characters in the setting no matter what I do, that's no fun).<br/>\n<br/>\nDislikes:<br/>\nI do not get a thrill from defeating another real player (usual motivation behind PvP)<br/>\nI do not like playing a complex character when it is not supported.<br/>\nI do not like it when my character dies (and my group has the highest chance of pulling it off). This isn't based on a Mary Sue mentality (I don't care as much if I fail) or from some sort of personality transfer to my character (I usually play 3rd person i.e., He/she does this, etc.), but from the fact that the death has always been meaningless and making a new char is a pain in the butt and un-fun. Plus you get the awkwardness of introducing a new character to the story, which can be even more un-fun and even stressful at times.<br/>\nI become uncomfortable inserting story ideas into the SIS if I do not know there will be buy in from other group members (this has been mis-identified as clinching or passiveness in the past).<br/>\nI do not want to hog spotlight and I don't want to play in a story by myself (RP'ing is a group activity after all)<br/>\nI do not like chaos where everyone is doing their own thing and its too much to keep track of<br/>\nI do not like "Everything you say, your character says" or other such weird rules<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don't know that is a bunch of stuff off the top of my head and I am not sure how much of it applies to you or your friends, but I hope it helps<br/>\n  In the end, I might suggest games that straddle the line pretty well. DItV is a good example of a game that supports gamism, but also Nar in a pretty effective way. I can tell you that you will never be able to get a group like that to play Bliss Stage or Mutual Decision, but there has to be games that fall somewhere in between hardcore Gamism (CP2020) and hardcore Nar (Polaris).<br/>\n  Another option might be Paranoia or Toon. Games where death is meaningless and an interplay between PCs would be more fun.<br/>\n  I don't know, it almost sounds like you are just looking for an excuse to leave that group. Well, whatever you do, good luck man!<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138987/#Comment_138987" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-10T08:38:45+00:00" title="April 10, 2008  8:38AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            DinD, that's a cool catalog of preferences, I like that you worked them out explicitly.

I feel like there is this idea that just because a player likes party play, that means all he wants to play is D&amp;D. I haven't played D&amp;D since 1991, you know? I've never given a damn about niche protection. I like fantasy games, but I don't want to kill a god. I want to develop a story with the other players, but I don't want my contribution to e a solo one. I've played SoY and loved it. But GURPS has no appeal to me at all (I've never even played it), you know?<br/>\n  As an example, I would probably never play Trollbabe. Not because its rules light or a Nar game, but because if you obey the setting, the PCs almost never meet each other. I sat in on some sessions and it just seemed like some kind freeform, solo play. That is not my style. Worse thing is, the rules are really great. I think it wold be fun to play as a party game, but then you kinda break the setting, so I dunno...<br/>\n  As to my group, I've hit them with some of it, but, not full laundry list. Mostly this is just my attempt to try and talk openly about different gaming styles and maybe come up with some kind of compromise, you know? By and large, we are all on the same wavelength, so its less of an issue, really.<br/>\n  I've seen other threads about weening gamers into this style or that. But I think a lot of it is developed in a vacuum. Sometimes this is because both sides aren't clear about what they want or they are not communicating effectively. And my experiences trying to learn this style of game have been just as blind. Many times I will ask a question, like "How do I know if a game idea is right to add to the SIS" and I'll get a zen/bogus answers like "I dunno, just try it and see if it works" See what I mean? Vague advice is worse than no advice, you know? Because then it is impossible to ask a follow up question. The sort of Yoda advice I have got doesn't tell me what to do and it kills the conversation, right?<br/>\n  Anyways, I just hope this helps bridge the gap somehow. Because I really want to play and enjoy other kinds of games. I see games like Nobilis and HeroQuest and I think that could be fun. But then I get into the middle of it and I get no support from seasoned gamers.<br/>\n  There is this credo that a player can do whatever they want, but its not true. You still have the confines of the group (whether its party play or not). So, why not get it out there in the open,what you like/dislike and then have fun starting from there?<br/>\n  Anyways, I know this is sort of derailing the thread, but my hope is, that the OP can make it releveant by using it to come to terms with players that like Party play.<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139087/#Comment_139087" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-10T12:50:08+00:00" title="April 10, 2008 12:50PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul,<br/>\n  What's a good team?

That can suck if that's all that ties together a team: I'm the thief because we need someone sneaky! Duh! <br/><br/>I'm thinking there's also "niche" as in "the drama/personality/conflict I bring into this group of people." And I do think there's room for the concept of "protecting" that niche. Like...how many people in your group really need to be avenging the murder of their father? How many different ways can one group do "I'm devoted to the cause through obedience, but my cowardice may keep me from fulfilling my duties"?<br/><br/>So...good teams. Stargate got me thinking, because while everyone's on the team via shared loyalties to their CO, as well as mutual loyalties forged through several seasons of friendship, each character on the show has his own character-driven thing. There's the guy who needs to balance honor against group loyalty. There's the guy who needs to be in charge. There's the guy who needs to do the right thing, even if it's not the expedient thing. So in game terms, they all share a job: go through the Gate and deal with the alien dickheads on the other side. But in story terms the "going through the gate" thing is just an excuse for them to work out their individual stuff. <br/><br/>The team structure is there to ensure everyone has a story reason to share scenes, and that's valuable. Sometimes it can feel strained when players find themselves needing to look for reasons to stab each other in the face. This was, in fact, a <i>Dust Devils</i> thing: someone needed chips, so they looked at their Devil ("cruel") and started casting about for reasons to be kind while in a conflict. Since they didn't have an existing team thing in place (we're on in the same posse! we're employed by the same rail baron!) it felt like kind of a stretch to require that much authorship on the parts of the characters.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139159/#Comment_139159" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-10T18:33:40+00:00" title="April 10, 2008  6:33PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think your list of preferences there matches a fair number of players in my group, though I'd mix in spotlight desires for another reason they don't like to split up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139181/#Comment_139181" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-10T22:09:46+00:00" title="April 10, 2008 10:09PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DInDenver</cite>I see games like Nobilis and HeroQuest and I think that could be fun.

(And for that matter: What do you mean by "seasoned gamers" in this context?)<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139211/#Comment_139211" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-11T06:32:46+00:00" title="April 11, 2008  6:32AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joel,<br/>\n  I am going to be a little vague, in case someone I played with comes here. I don't want it to seem like an indictment of their effort or whatever. But by seasoned gamer, I meant someone who had been playing and GMing HQ for over a year and playing Nar style games for a very long time (at least 5 years that I know of, probably longer).<br/>\n  So, what I was looking for was a way to learn this Nar style. I admitted straight out that I was looking for a new experience and I emphasized that I didn't have a clue. I tried to get input and feedback, but what I mostly got back was, "It is all good."<br/>\n  I had joined a long-running campaign mid-stream. there was a lot of info on-line to help me get up to speed. But, I kept getting the same message, "do what you like." But what I found was, if I did what I was told, I was increasingly isolated from the group. Furthermore, when it was not my turn, I had nothing to do except watch the rest of the groups play. And when it was my turn, I felt an uncomfortable amount of spotlight, compounded by the fact that the other players were not willing or able to jump in to my little side-plot. Now, the narration was flowing as a series of side plots, it seemed like when I joined (although I didn't realize this until later) that there were two distinct subgroups and people were participating in one of those based on plot preference. Inadvertently (through advice given by the GM), I had created a third plotline. The issue with this is, I had no buy-in from the other players (I didn't know that this was possible at the time, nor did I know it was an issue til it was too late), and on top of that, the characters were already embroiled in other plotlines. So, I had no interaction with the other characters. And only minor interaction with the other players,<br/>\n  Now, there may have been a method to this madness. the idea may have been to give me a chance to try it on for size or whatever. But, instead it felt kinda lonely. And when my turn came up, I felt a lot of pressure to do my thing quick, because I was holding up a lot of people.<br/>\n  The point of this is not to disparage one GM or to say that HQ is good or bad (personally, I like it and am trying to figure out how to use some of the mechanics in new ways). But to point out that, especially for noobie nar gamers, a little restriction is a good thing. Giving people rigid guidance is better than vague answers. And that sometimes, it is not all good. Sometimes, we need to set a guideline and then let people break from that guideline when they understand how your group/system style of gaming plays.<br/>\n  Does that make sense?<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139239/#Comment_139239" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-11T08:03:41+00:00" title="April 11, 2008  8:03AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 11, 2008 8:14AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Makes sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nDave here is talking about my game. Vague, Dave? You couldn't have identified my game better if you had put a barcode on it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI fully admit that my online game suffers from the problems that you cite. Not only that, but I knew that you were suffering this way when we were playing. It was quite obvious to me. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy didn't I fix it? Well I could go on and on about the particulars of that game. But I think that it's a tad off topic here. It'll have to suffice to say that I have reasons for running that game the way I run it, and that, in fact, I'll admit to being a tad lazy and that I don't even run it as well as I'd like to. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou have my apologies. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, yeah, largely that comes down to me not putting in enough "constraints" on play. You're absolutely right, Dave. Now, there's a lot of theory as to good ways to do this for the sort of play that I try to encourage, but withoug getting into those details, I'd say that the problem wasn't that we didn't have the right sort of "constraint," as simply too little at all. <br/>\n<br/>\nDave, if your opinion of "Nar" play and systems is based on my game, I'd say that you really should try to play others to get a better sense of what it's about. Not that mine isn't typical in some ways, but it's very atypical in others. I'd strongly suggest you try it face to face, for one. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMost importantly to this thread, this is all still missing the point. Even in nar play, team concepts are just fine. Teams are a red herring here. The real question isn't even what sort of constraints are put on play, but why they are put there, and what sort of play they attempt to create. While your catalogue (as JD puts it) is interesting, Dave, it's likely very different from that of Paul's players. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. I... I won't say that I don't like to GM... but I'd prefer to play. I run games mostly because nobody else will. Does that give you any insight as to why I play like I do, Dave? Or why I might create a game like Universalis?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Help me not hate "teams" - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6260/help-me-not-hate-teams/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content='Help me not hate "teams" - Page 2' itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6260/help-me-not-hate-teams/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Mike,&lt;br /&gt;

And only the very small section of the community that knows me would know I was talking about your game, you ding dong.<br/>\n  My post was really about the first month of my play in your game. In reality after that much time, you and I tried pretty hard to iron out the kinks. It was unfortunate that our schedules went out of synch again, that we didn't get to bring the work we did to full fruition, but I had fun and learned a lot, so don't feel bad man!<br/>\n  I have played a few "Nar" games including OtherKind, SoY (I think that Nar, not sure though), DItV, HQ, Alex's Ensemble, Nobilis, ...In Spaaace! and maybe one or two others that slip my mind.<br/>\n  Well, the OP was asking about Team play (which I prefer), so that's why I keep trying to bring it back to Team Play and not hog the Spotlight (lol).<br/>\n  Maybe that is the real point. In a purely Gamist mechanical-style game (ala D&amp;D or whatever), you can make a char in isolation and it will work no matter what. But in more Nar style play, you need to elicit feedback and then incorporate it into chargen more so than most other play styles I think... So, a Team works for Nar play, when players bounce ideas off of each others and use the ones that get most people jazzed up, but it falls flat when everyone just brings a char from the A-Team...<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139300/#Comment_139300" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-11T11:56:23+00:00" title="April 11, 2008 11:56AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a really funny "team" memory on my way to work this morning, lucky you, I want to share it. Oh yeah, helmets on to prevent brain damage, it's a Vampire story! (Will that well ever run dry? I can't imagine how...)<br/>\n<br/>\nI played in an oWoD Vampire game.  The characters were supposed to be in a coterie. For them's as don't know, a coterie is a passel of vampires what work together for some reason, usually because vampire society is full of maniacal bloodthirsty psychos who hate you and are more powerful than you.  So we made a coterie. I played a hideously ugly black marketeer who I based on "The Third Man", the kind of guy who would cut pharmaceuticals at a children's hospital to make an extra buck.  We had a lot of interesting characters, and worked out the byplay between them as best we could. A media-magnate vampiress with unbelievable connections and influence in that field. A restauranteur who could no longer enjoy any of the food his Top Chefs cooked but who was a social climber.  A bitter occultist who had been burned by a deal with a demon.  A medieval 'artificial vampire' made through a mystic ritual, uncomfortable in modern society.  The idea being that we each had our skills and resources we brought to the coterie and we worked out various backstories and so on, had a good old time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn play, though, the GM semi-rewrote a lot of the characters, their interests, their goals, and so on, leaving us uncertain as to how to participate in the world he was creating.  Worst of all, he emphasized the divergent goals and de-emphasized the common goals, so all the work we'd done in creating relationships and backstories, which was itself there to support the fact that we like to banter and argue in-character, was pretty much wasted.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt one point several of the characters had collected a few plot tokens and wanted to share them with the rest of the group, so they called a meeting. We all pounced on the idea of having all the characters meet up, since they hadn't in three months of playing the game.  My guy was the last to arrive.  I described him coming into the meeting, the GM backed things up and said "As you are crawling out of the sewer, your cellphone rings." The group was so frustrated and pissed off that this team they'd done so much work on had not even been able to be in the same place, let alone work on things together, that the room exploded, almost in unison, with "NO IT DOESN'T!!!!"  I naturally am a much calmer personage. I looked the GM in the eye, and said firmly, "I don't answer."  Finally noticing how angry we were, the GM backed off and let us have the meeting.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, too much had been laid in place for the team to 'stick together', even on a common goal (we don't mind splitting up a lot so long as we're all working on the same thing), so the game drizzled out a few sessions after that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was a situation where the "team" was where the interesting story for one group of people was, and where someone else did everything they could to block that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139313/#Comment_139313" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-11T13:07:36+00:00" title="April 11, 2008  1:07PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave, this must be how people get the opinion that there's some omerta code around here that we don't talk about our bad games or something. There were problems with my game. Don't backpedal now, just because everybody knows who's game it was to which you were referring. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm glad you've tried some other games, and it does support your more general point if you found similar problems in those games. I'd go so far as to say, however, that it's endemic to that particular community of nigh-freeformers, not at all a neccessary part of nar games. Put another way, if you'd ever played one of Ron's games face-to-face, you wouldn't be saying that these games were all about lack of constraint (you might complain about the intensity of the constraints or something, but it'd be a different complaint at least). Or even if you'd played one of my convention demos, like the one I have where all of the characters are doomed to die. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's a creative constraint right there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, it's not about the constraints here, but their role. The players in Paul's game, the two in question, seem to only want constraints on play that give them something to work off of in a tactical sense. Sure, a team works great for that. So would Agon, I'd argue. Or Rune, where the players take turns being the bad guy. <br/>\n<br/>\nNone of that helps Paul out, who is looking for a way to have the constraints both support his friends' gamism play, and his agenda at the same time. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6260/help-me-not-hate-teams" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6260/help-me-not-hate-teams" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6260/help-me-not-hate-teams/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F6260%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F6260%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
