It featured a lot of being captured and put in jail. The winter of 2005-06, I think.<br/><br/>Really, in that particular context... it's just not a special turn of events. You go on to play the game according to its rules. Either the character succeeds in escaping, or the sheriff offers him a deal for his freedom, or he gets beaten up and broken down in prison (which is a pretty cool process in that particular game, note). And I think that goes for all games; just follow the rules of the game, and be aware of what you're trying to do and how being captured slots into that. Sometimes the slot is, being captured is equivalent to death for the character; play it that way and don't waste time spinning your wheels.<br/><br/>As for the feeling of suckage, I can't off-hand say what's up with that, unless you're stumbling with how to continue the flow of the fiction after capturing a character by mistake and only afterwards realizing that it's a death penalty in the particular game, which you didn't want to inflict, and are thus stuck in the unenviable position of a GM about to screw up his game - that happened to me a couple of times during the '90s, but I learned from it and stopped putting in capture scenes unless I knew I'd have something more interesting than a quick execution or a full session of not doing anything waiting.<br/><br/>Actually, another explanation would be that a player has some fragile and straightforward wish fulfillment going on, and getting captured is messing with his image of his super-cool character, who should never fail in a debasing manner. But that's such a conditional explanation that I wouldn't expect it to hold for most cases.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf" title="Bailywolf"><img alt="Bailywolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf">Bailywolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170738/#Comment_170738" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-23T13:41:29+00:00" title="September 23, 2008  1:41PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fuck no.<br/><br/>Get captured.

Disadvantage of this one is that you may need to be prepared to have years pass in the game world for the full effect, though even a brief horrific capture experience can be built upon. I'm thinking of Kitty Pryde in the hands of the Morlocks here.<br/>* If you're not actually in prison, but, say, tied up in the villain's hideout: overhearing something while presumed unconscious/helpless which will help you defeat them, and may even help you escape.<br/><br/>Daring escape/rescue pretty much needs to be part of all of these scenarios eventually, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170742/#Comment_170742" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-23T13:47:01+00:00" title="September 23, 2008  1:47PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Being captured in a game CAN suck most of the time, but it can also work. In my own experience, in a game of MLWM, it worked fine. It was a set back to be sure, but the players were already expecting to be at the whim of some other force, so it worked.<br/><br/>In D&amp;D, I've played in a game where my character was captured, and it worked. I think here it was a matter of play style: my character had some magic abilities, so using those abilities creatively to escape (with the GM's help in that he allowed spells to be used beyond the exact rules written) was a lot of fun. I like characters being put in tough situations where they have to think about their abilities differently, so it worked (for me).<br/><br/>Finally, I'd offer the podcast WotC did with the guys from Penny Arcade and PvP. Their run of Keep on the Shadowfell becomes pretty short as the PCs are captured, only to be taken straight to the last encounter, and there they get their revenge. Not only did it sound fun to play, it was fun to listen to.<br/><br/>I'd agree, being taken captive is somewhat likely to suck. But it can also obviously work.

It doesn't suck if it opens up, and in fact requires, action which (from a character viewpoint) is a struggle but (from a player viewpoint) is interesting to play through.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170757/#Comment_170757" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-23T14:34:45+00:00" title="September 23, 2008  2:34PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lot of time a captured scene ends up being about what you can't do as opposed to finding a way out, or even roleplaying your captivity.

Corwin only has that whole assault on Amber so he can be locked up, the locking up is the important bit, so its a story *about* capture.

So don't make that the stakes. If the players fail the roll, then they have to dump the precious McGuffin to get away. Or they have to make a deal with some thugs to distract the persuers, a debt which is likely to bite them on the rear later. It's like any other consequence: in some games, a nuclear device being detonated won't be fun, but in other situations it can work.<br/><br/>So when doesn't a given consequence (capturing or other) work:<br/><br/>-When it changes the precepts of the game<br/>-When it's forced on a character/player<br/>-When it does not allow later adjustment (if being captured means never escaping)<br/>-When it means wasted time (in character or out)<br/><br/>I'm sure there's more...<br/><br/>So in some conditions all of these can change. If the players play street level criminals, being caught is part of the game. This probably also means the players go along with it. In this case it's open to adjustment later (lawyers and/or dynamite can often fix jail problems, or time can be served), and it doesn't have to be wasted time (even if it's 'montaged' over, the character could still get some new connections/enemies, find out about a new job to pull, have a new outlook on life, etc.).<br/><br/>In a typical D&amp;D game it doesn't work so well: being basically continuously beaten for that long isn't part of the concept, the players tend to like being the biggest kids in the sandbox (or at least not the wimps), a magical prison could basically rule out escape except through railroad-plot means, and the typical D&amp;D character may not get much out of being in prison (depending on the the type of prison).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170784/#Comment_170784" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-23T16:33:11+00:00" title="September 23, 2008  4:33PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was going to say pretty much exactly that.

That might be workable, but it still puts them at a disadvantage.  The situation might be salvaged with help from someone they wouldn't expect.  Some things that might play well: acquiring a tool that helps them escape or defeat the bad guys, being told the bad guys' secret weakness, being aided by someone who isn't what they seem at first.<br/><br/>If their objective is to gain power and exercise it, then this is a definite step backwards.  Being captured necessarily means that someone else was more powerful, and that they have the capacity to prevent the player characters from furthering their own goals.  Players with power as a goal will be (perhaps rightfully) upset with this turn of events.  Help from someone they wouldn't expect *might* work, but if that person upstages the power of the player characters, they'll resent it.<br/><br/>If what they want to do is do the right thing, being captured might make that difficult.  One might be able to use capture as part of the path to a choice that pits right/wrong against personal interests.  For example, being offered release in exchange for something the player characters can give but don't want to fall into enemy hands.  A thing to avoid if your players have this goal is putting them in situations where they must violate their sense of right in order to resolve the situation.  "Shoot these helpless people, and we'll let you leave" will *not* go over well -- not that it ever will, but even less so here than with players with other goals.<br/><br/>If what they want to do is strategize, capture runs the risk of narrowing the available options too much.  In particular, one of the things I've often seen happen is that the characters' equipment and resources are stripped away.  This will be infuriating to someone who wants to strategize, because they no longer have the means to carry out their plans.  Not only that, but the situation can easily turn into a pixel hunt, where every escape route save for one is blocked and the players' have to play "guess what the GM is thinking."  Way to make this more workable would be to provide the characters with some resources, offer multiple ways to escape (each with benefits and drawbacks), and allow varying degrees of success and failure.<br/><br/>If what they want to do is make meaningful choices that reveal character depth, capture can go either way.  In order to create meaningful choices, the key strategies are to base story elements (e.g. NPCs) on things the players have indicated or flagged that they want to explore.  These can vary widely, but whatever happens will have to interest the players.  Something to avoid is using the captors' power over the characters to ensure that the captors perspective is the only one relevant to the situation.<br/><br/>If what they want to do is align forces to create effects on whole systems, being captured could have the effect of limiting the size of the system they're involved with.  That's not generally something these players will enjoy, and the situation also runs the risk of becoming single-faceted and therefore uninteresting.  Here the trick is to show them that there are multiple processes happening simultaneously which create interesting interaction dynamics.  In the case of a prison, there may be, for example, racially motivated violence occurring between the other inmates.  Meanwhile, the guards union is renegotiating their contract, and the government is investigating a member of the prison administration for money laundering.  If you let these players explore a little bit, you'll find them gravitating toward the place where these three things come together.<br/><br/>There is no one answer -- it depends on the players' tastes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170804/#Comment_170804" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-23T17:37:28+00:00" title="September 23, 2008  5:37PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for this thread, it's inspired a few paragraphs which are going into the Pentasystem (in which "stakes" are referred to as "outcomes"):\n<blockquote>Don't set outcomes that will be no fun, that will be game-stoppers. Consider: Our Hero is attempting to cross a swinging rope bridge. Nameless tribesmen are hacking at it with machetes. You might, at first blush, be tempted to make the outcomes "He crosses the bridge successfully before the bridge comes down, or it drops into the void with him screaming until he splatters on the rocks below."<br/>That may be what is apparently at stake in the fiction, from the point of view of the character. Those are the "realistic stakes", if you like. But fictionalistically, the hero isn't going to die because some nameless tribesmen chop the vines of a rope bridge. It's just not going to happen, so it shouldn't be nominated as an outcome.<br/>Try instead: "He gets to the other side just before the bridge comes down and is in time to take up a good ambush position, or the bridge comes down with him clinging on to it and delays him plus presenting him with the challenge of getting up the cliff."<br/>Death, crippling injuries, the loss of limbs and sensory organs, often imprisonment, even failure itself in the later stages \u2013 all of these can bring the game to a screeching halt and leave you looking at each other and thinking, "Well, that kind of killed the fun. Now what do we do?" If it's not going to be fun, keep it off the table \u2013 don't set it as an outcome. If you can think of a way for any of these things to be fun (in a fairly broad sense of "fun", in some cases \u2013 interesting to play out), by all means make them outcomes. But there should always be a good way forward in the story from both nominated outcomes.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170818/#Comment_170818" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-23T19:37:00+00:00" title="September 23, 2008  7:37PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On the other side of "imprisonment as helplessness", let me relate two reasons why imprisonment can suck:<br/><br/>1.

Ditch all the boring parts of the immediate aftermath and just jump to the good part of having a captive, whatever that might be?  In much the same way that few players want to play inmates when the game was not pitched to them as such, few players are interested in playing jailors under the same circumstances; and if that's the only thing they're going to get out of being captured or capturing, you can bet cash money that they won't enjoy it one bit.  Maybe skipping ahead to the part that they <i>can</i> enjoy makes the most sense.<br/><br/><br/>I know that as a player, I tend to look for any solution that <i>doesn't</i> lead to capturing bad guys, because dealing with them has always been a headache.  Much like every PC imprisoned leads inevitably to a prison break, every NPC captured seems to lead inevitably to the captive getting away, invariably without providing any benefits to the captors.  Or the captive stonewalling you during an interrogation (seriously, why is it always the iron-willed "I got nothin' to say to you, copper" types who get captured, and never the weaselly "hey, for a sandwich and a bus ticket out of town, I'll tell you anything you want to know" hangers-on?).  Or forcing you to find a place to stash them, or forcing you to arrange shifts of PCs to keep watch over them, or leading to endless whinging arguments over what you're going to do with them afterwards...blech.  Boring, boring, BORING.  Not to mention frustrating, unrewarding, and a waste of game time which might have otherwise been spent doing something more fun.  It's the kind of play experience that makes your D&amp;D character automatically respond to any enemy sighting with "I waste him with my crossbow," because you've learned that while a dead bad guy isn't all that interesting, it's not nearly as fucking annoying as dealing with a captive one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/avram" title="avram"><img alt="avram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/733/n64KGLTEFAF9C.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/avram">avram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170832/#Comment_170832" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-23T22:26:23+00:00" title="September 23, 2008 10:26PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In one campaign I played in, getting captured was part of our plan.

A wide variety of skills are applicable, so everyone can contribute.<br/><br/>I just did this in our 4E Shadowfell game.  To nuance things a bit, I layered another skill challenge on top of the escape challenge.  The party, having been owned by Irontooth, was working on a chain gang at a dragon tomb dig.  The dragon skeleton in the tomb was being prepared for animation as a zombie-dragon, which would be Bad News for the town under the party's protection and a major triumph for the bad guys.<br/><br/>Each character could choose to either roll on a skill challenge to sabotage the reanimation ritual, or on a skill challenge to escape -- and all the while, the dread cold-lightning radiance of Orcus was leeching away their life energy, so they couldn't dilly-dally.  They chose to escape, and the reanimation went off without a hitch.<br/><br/>The hard part of an escape skill challenge, I think, is coming up with interesting consequences for failure. "You don't escape" isn't really a good one.  So in this example, had the party bunko'd the escape challenge, their souls would have been sucked down into the Abyss and they would've had to do some special ops stuff for the Raven Queen before she'd help them back to the Prime Material.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170838/#Comment_170838" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T00:35:38+00:00" title="September 24, 2008 12:35AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Surely getting captured and escaping is one of the basic building blocks of most adventure stories? As with most things however, its not what you do, its how you do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am reminded of Uncanny X-Men <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23113&amp;Mode=like">#113</a> (iirc) where the X-Men are captured by Magneto and Storm undoes the locks with her hidden lockpick and her knees and teeth. Its a scene that stood out for me as a kid because it cemented that little referenced part of her life (as a street thief in Egypt) within the wider story. It was cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nCapture (and inevitable escape) allows your characters to look really cool. It allows them to do their cool shit in ways that underline their greatness. Think of some of the great 'captured but escape' scenarios in film - Princess Leia from the Death Star, Jones and Jones Jnr. from the Nazis and the entire Lobby Scene from the Matrix. All based on people being captured.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, there is nothing I find more infuriating than having a group of players who refuse to be captured even though they blatantly should be captured. You know the scenario. Players surrounded by stormtroopers with the commandant sneering at them, adjusts his monocole and says 'Now I have you! When we return to the base, Dr Xavier will expose you to the Zuton Experiment and the future of the Fourth Reich will be secure!'. Players turn as one and say 'We fight!'. What they are really saying is 'Ha! Ha! Its not like you are going to machine gun us down like dogs! We're the PCs. We GLOW! We double dog dare you to unleash a deus ex machina on us. Go on. Be That Bad GM!' Nothing has me reaching for those machine gun rules faster.... don't kid a kidder.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for capturing people? The last NPC that we were presented with as a captive got a warhammer in her face from my Paladin. She was an evil cabalist. It was a mercy killing. Gotta love shades of grey 4e....<br/>\n<br/>\nReally, tell them to get over themselves and go with the flow.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170853/#Comment_170853" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T05:07:03+00:00" title="September 24, 2008  5:07AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bailywolf</cite>It seems a weird attitude for a story focused game board, when the opportunities presented by such a radical turn in fortunes promise so much potential story and fun- getting tossed in the hoosegow opens whole new areas of trouble.

When faced with a similar situation in one of my games, where I was game mastering and envisioning the capture as an exciting chapter in the adventure, my players told me they saw it as me (the GM) taking character control away from them. They were at the mercy of their captors and the GM, so either I was going to tell them how to escape or tell them they escaped. Either way, it wasn't their game.<br/><br/>To be honest, its the same thing with insanity or other character ailments.

(I saw you at the back, unsure... see me later!) then whats the difference between having violent encounters and being captured?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a fantasy game, for example, there is no chance on Earth that you are going to die to the goblin guards on your way to your brother, who is cuckolding your wife, the evil, the despicable Black Wizard Zorg. So why have them there? You know you will fight them and you know you will beat them. You know that in the process something inconvenient may happen, but they really are just window dressing before the main event. Why bother?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really confounds me that people can see an imaginary prison as well ... an imagination prison. Every single prison drama, prison break, prison camp escape that I have seen has been chocked full of people doing what the hell they damned well please under the noses of the guards. From Porridge to Prison Break, from The Shawshank Redemption to Escape to Victory - its been all about the characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, being captured is like being shipwrecked, being tied to the nuclear rocket, being possessed by the spirit of Hitler, being seduced by a vampire, being routed off the field of battle, being humiliated in the court of the King etc. Its a consequence of failure. It in and of itself is not the end!<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170894/#Comment_170894" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T08:32:44+00:00" title="September 24, 2008  8:32AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It may not be the end of the story, but it may very well be the end of the kind of fun you're looking for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170895/#Comment_170895" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T08:34:45+00:00" title="September 24, 2008  8:34AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bailywolf</cite> A little clever GM jiggery pokery can also change a turn in stir into a vital plot-driving element.

For everyone else, there are strategies to making capture into an interesting situation -- but what's interesting to different people varies, depending largely on what they think is the most enjoyable activity available to them through roleplaying.  That might be exerting power, or it might be exploring issues, or it might be strategizing.  From each one of those perspectives, you'll see something different when you look at being captured.<br><br>Oddly enough, that means that it really doesn't matter what you think about being captured, at least not out here on the interweb.  It only matters in the context of group interaction, and whether or not the people you actually play with can form a functional intra- and inter-personal dynamic that satisfies your individual desires to engage in particular cognitive activities in an imagined context.<br/><br/>EDIT: Next time you're together, ask the people in your group if being captured sucks and why!

That, combined with the brutal system for violent conflict, is <i>supposed</i> to train people away from "fight to the death!" when not absolutely necessary and into "fight to the defeat," so that your guy doesn't burn out and die in one session.  But there's still a hell of a lot of unnecessary fights to the death, and a lot of PCs burning out faster than they need to.<br/><br/>As for getting captured?

As Neil pointed out, even in something like Star Wars. As I typically end up playing superhero or espionage games, it's a common trope. For those supers games, it's even more complicated because often the characters are powerful enough to really power through if they want. So as a GM, I'd feel stuck between wanting to let players roleplay the encounter, but not wanting to have to play out a *fight* between the pcs and the "authorities." As a player, I'd feel it natural to want to resist the "authorities", and if the GM suddenly cut to us in jail, that it'd be railroading.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe solution is to establish the tropes ahead of time. Discuss with the players the scenario and the likely cliches, such as being captured/escaping/living on the edge of the law/whatever. (Discuss even the things that won't happen but are still tropes, if you think you need to "hide" the event and keep some surprise.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut really, I only had problems with it when I was young and my players young. We'd rant about it for a while, but still enjoy the game after we were done and reflected on it.

And it was very bad. It was in a Star Trek Campaign and there was literally nothing I could do. I was in a holding cell alone and the guards were klingon and not likely to talk to me. I let it go for a bit and finally I asked, what am I supposed to do and they suggested I break out. Since the campaign was set on the station, I didn't see how that would work in my favor as far as participating in the campaign went. Especially since breaking the law, destroying government property and making myself a wanted man was no in character for the character I was playing...<br>\n  I really can't think of a situation where being incarcerated would be good for the group. I mean the variety of things your character can do are pretty limited. I guess it can be a decent challenge/puzzle for characters that are already on the wrong side of the law. But, even then, there are only so many combinations of actions/outcomes to play out before it becomes boring.<br/>\n  I think that is the two elements of the issue (as previously stated): Deprotagonization and predictability. If you can counter those issues and everyone is on board, have fun!<br/>\nDave M                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171257/#Comment_171257" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T11:57:39+00:00" title="September 25, 2008 11:57AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I think the Story Game consensus is "no, capture doesn't make it suck" for the players because the players can still do whatever they want - <br/><br/>GM: So you were captured by the countess's men and are waiting for her to arrive in the morning to hang you.<br/>Player: Awesome!

Being captured means someone else was more powerful.  These players will never like capture, because it directly violates their notion of how they have fun with roleplaying.<br/><br/>Trying to find a "consensus" by sort of averaging out what people say in this thread might give you a really weird biased picture of how you can expect a roleplayer picked at random to think about capture -- because the consensus here is strongly tilted toward a certain sort of game.  Story Games, I think they call them.  If your group is all about story gaming, then great!  Take this wisdom and go forth to apply it and enjoy fun games.  If it's not so unanimous, which seems to be the case in a decent number of groups, you might want to just...you know...ask them how they feel about capture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171282/#Comment_171282" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T13:03:57+00:00" title="September 25, 2008  1:03PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 25, 2008 1:06PM by eruditus.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, sure.

How long does it take him to get out? If the character has enemies, do they take advantage of him being stuck in one place and unarmed? If the character has friends, how do they react to associating with a known criminal? If he's escaped once, is there now an 'execute on sight' order in effect? Does being a wanted man (for the original crime and the escape) make new jobs harder? Does getting out of prison take something (monetary, social, moral, or otherwise) from the character? Is being in prison a horrible experience, therefore making going back a fate worse then death? <br/><br/>Heck, I could even imagine a situation where a character (a devout cleric of a faith not in favor with the government) gets captured and actually finds that he likes being in prison, since he gets a chance to preach to those that might actually want to hear, and arguably need him the most. Now when the breakout comes, does he even want to leave?<br/><br/>Inevitability is not at the root of a poor story (see: My Life With Master, an awesome game where the outcome is inevitable). Filling in the details is half the fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171310/#Comment_171310" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T14:09:56+00:00" title="September 25, 2008  2:09PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like Eero said, what getting captured means in a game will depend on the rules. In old style DnD, for example, it meant getting hammered down to 0 hit points or failing saving throw and in either case losing one's ability to put input into the game. Also, the rules of the game will define where the focus is -- so again in old style DnD a lot of focus is on "can we succeed." <br/><br/>Other game systems can have characters captured without reducing player effectiveness or participation. They even reward players for getting their character's into messes. They also put the emphasis on "where's the character's story going" rather than "can he succeed." The best example of this I can think of is Primetime Adventures, where card draws determine conflicts important to the drama, not successes at in game actions. In particular, in a PTA game, you may find your characters in a situation where everybody agrees that the point of the card draw is not whether they get captured, but how they respond to the situation. The scene may even start with the group agreeing "this is the scene where Suzy is captured" Then the card resolution determines things like "does Joe run away?" "Does Suzy go berserk?" "Does Glorop finally tell Suzy he loves her?" PTA actually rewards this kind of play.<br/><br/>The same goes for time in detention. It's quite possible for Suzy's player to play on without ever declaring escape as the objective of conflict mechanics. But at the same time she has plenty of opportunity to play -- she can draw for "Does the imprisonment break her spirit", "Does she keep the secret", "Does she keep a fellow prisoner alive and sane," "Does she learn Goldfinger's plan?" etc. etc. <br/><br/>I'm recalling an episode of Firefly where Mal and Wash are captured and tortured by Mr Niska. They have plenty of scenes where the point is to keep each other alive and sane and defy Niska. Meanwhile, the rest of the crew have to launch the rescue. This kind of thing is very fun in PTA. Much harder to do without fudging rules and changing purpose of play in many other systems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171316/#Comment_171316" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T14:28:18+00:00" title="September 25, 2008  2:28PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well said, Alan.  It depends on the game, for sure.<br/><br/>A lot of people are posting what makes being captured OK for them, or how one could make being captured not suck from some specific perspective.  Which is all OK, I suppose, but kind of off-topic, since the OP asked:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sean Musgrave</cite>Can you explain why that is? If you don't believe that 'capturing = suck', can you articulate why it seems to suck for a variety of people?</blockquote>\nFour fundamental reasons I can think of that cover every case of someone getting upset over being captured that I've witnessed:<br/>*Renders the characters powerless or reduces character's perceived power (Warrior mode)<br/>*Implies that the characters have done something wrong (Manager mode)<br/>*Excessively reduces available options for action (Strategist mode)<br/>*Fails to produce meaningful decision points (Radical mode)<br/><br/>Of the four, the easiest to handle are the last two, since you can always introduce more options or more decisions.  The first two are harder to handle, because it's difficult to reverse a perception of wrongness or powerlessness without ret-conning.<br/><br/>(You can probably see where these modes overlap with Alan's points too -- certain games cater to certain modes much more than others.  Situations that counteract the sort of play that a particular game is meant to support will curtail the fun of people who enjoy playing that way.)<br/><br/>Has anyone seen someone get upset over being captured in a way that isn't explained by one of the items on that list?
