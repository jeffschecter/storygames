I brought up my "minimum bar" which is that a game text should tell you what the roles, goals and agenda of each of the players is.  I mentioned, for example, that Burning Empires meets my minimum bar because it plainly tells the players that they should try to win the Infection mechanic and try to fulfill their Beliefs and that the GM should try to win the Infection mechanic and should challenge the player's Beliefs.  It's also clear that the text is confident that the procedures in the text, "just work" and that while adjudicating the rules is part of the GM's job, changing or breaking them is not.<br/><br/>I went on to point out that the text of Burning Empires doesn't go any further than that.  It doesn't for example offer much on strategy for winning the Infection mechanic.  It doesn't really talk about what exactly "challenging a Belief" means.  It seemed to me that much of the discussion in that thread was turning towards texts that move beyond my minimum bar.  I offered to talk about why I thought moving beyond that minimum bar is so difficult, especially for more narrative focused games like Sorcerer or Dogs in the Vineyard.  There was interest so here it goes.<br/><br/>The "how" people are talking about is basically the equivalent of a strategy guide for a board game or video game.  Most of those games tell you what to do and why you're doing it but don't tell you HOW to do it most effectively.  They, rightfully I believe, leave that up for discovery via play and practice.  You play a game, it works out okay but it peaks your further interest.  You play AGAIN and discover more about the game and consequently like it a bit more.  You keep playing and learn more and more and slowly you build up the skill and knowledge to master the game.<br/><br/>Something I want to point out is that a lot of strategy guides work on patterns.  Even master class chess guides are largely about patterns.  I remember playing the Icewind Dale computer RPG and out of curiosity I happened to be using the strategy guide.  It had an example party and the odd thing about it was that it recommended THREE fighters ALL specialized in bows.  I thought that was weird, until I tried it.  Holy CRAP! NOTHING, and I mean NOTHING got within 5 feet of my party.  I was a walking machine gun of death.  But here's the thing, the guide still didn't tell me HOW they figured that out.<br/><br/>Even when you're dealing with something fairly discrete and mathematical explaining how you get a certain result is really hard.  Making the jump to role-playing games most D&amp;D strategy advice is about recognizing optimal build patterns.  Making the jump to more narrative focused games the problem is even worse.  How do you recognize a conflict (and not merely a lot of excited talking)?  What makes for good Stakes in stake setting games?  How do you recognize good moments for the characters take action (this includes NPCs for the GM).  What's a "minor" vs. "major" compromise in a Duel of Wits?<br/><br/>The truth is, it's easy to teach someone how to read music and play an intrument.  It's nigh impossible to teach them how to compose music from scratch.  At that point you're making the jump from mechanical musical instruction to musical composition theory.  First of all, aesthetics is partially personal (some may argue completely personal).  There is absolutely no way to craft a piece of music that is going to hit the exact same emotional chord in every person who hears it.  It is impossible.  The best you can do is shoot for some basic principles and all that will do is get you something that isn't completely discordant.<br/><br/>I've tried to write the "strategy guide" to Sorcerer more than once.  I call the project Sorcerer Unbound and it is my white whale.  You can see the essay version of some of the content on my website.  I have two or three half-complete drafts on my computer.  Every damn time I try I run into these walls where I'm really no longer talking about Sorcerer in specific but rather the more fundamental principles (and perhaps assumptions) of dramatic writing it's based on.<br/><br/>Which is why I was really glad that Christopher Kubasik was taking up the mantle with his Play Sorcerer book.  He's a professional screenwriter.  He knows the princples of craft better than I can ever hope to know.  Better yet, he has the self-discipline and focus to see a personal project through that I lack.  I assumed he'd be done in under a year.<br/><br/>He's still working on it.  This is partially due to the fact that his career took an unexpected and much deserved upswing.  But it's also partially due to the fact that the book is nigh impossible to write.  He and I have exchanged numerous emails and even had a couple of face-to-face meetings where we've talked at length about this and each and every time we come up with a NEW set of issues that really should be addressed.  Christopher says things like, "Well, that's another chapter."  Or "Hmmm... that's another 10 pages."<br/><br/>My original goal for Sorcerer Unbound was 32 to 64 pages.  Little more than a "missing" chapter from the core book.  Christopher, I think, was shooting for somewhere around 128 pages.  And both cases the project has overgrown and overflown the original scope.<br/><br/>Going beyond minimum instruction: "Do this." is just really hard and actually aquiring the know how through basic practice and repetition really is much easier.  But for basic practice and repetition to work the game has to have a focused application to begin with, so you can recognize when you're getting better at it.  That's why it's so frustrating when a game text doesn't even meet my bar for minimum instruction.<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297825/#Comment_297825" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-21T13:31:29+00:00" title="October 21, 2010  1:31PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To understand where you are coming from, would you put the concept of bluffing in poker in the "baseline" or the "strategy guide" category?

(or suchlike). <br/>As far as what stakes are important, I think that, too, can remain extremely subjective. But I would add that a good game design offers some help, either explicitly (where you flag certain character traits as important, like in Dogs) or generally (life, limb, friendship, property, etc., like in AW).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297838/#Comment_297838" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-21T13:59:15+00:00" title="October 21, 2010  1:59PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really appreciate it when games have at least a sidebar or two on how stuff is supposed to work and tips for effectiveness.

You're the author.  Go back to every page in the book and remind yourself why this page of text is even in the book to begin with.  Put that in a side bar.

To Challenge in Blood Red Sands you literally have to stand up at the table.  Those who agree with you must stand with you.

That's a really great example.  Like most things split into categories there's a really interesting grey zone.  Speaking from a strictly technical aspect I'd put it in the strategy guide category because it is neither a required procedure nor a direct agenda of play.  However, it's also relatively easy to explain and is probably worth noting in a core book on poker.  Something like, "It is not required that players bid in direct proportion to the strength of their hand.  In fact, it can be extremely beneficial to give the illusion of a stronger or weaker hand by over or under bidding."  For that matter what about the role of bragging or trash talking in poker?<br><br>The problem is that behind each technique and rule application lies a more difficult to answer "How" question.  For example, how do you identify the psychological table conditions for when bluffing is likely to be most effective?<br><br>How many layers do you personally expect the author/designer to go?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Isn't this what modules and adventures have done ever since the beginning? Take us beyond the "how to play" into a particular instance of playing?</blockquote>\nSure, absolutely and that works well for games which rely primarily on tactics or puzzles like a dungeon crawl or clue chain mystery.  However, it kind of falls apart when part of the game is intended to play off a given groups unique psychology.  My Life with Master plays best when The Master sits right on the knife's edge of sexy attractive villain and personal revulsion.  No "example Master" I create is going to produce that effect for someone else's group.  At least not reliably.<br><br>I've played Luke's example Burning Wheel scenario The Gift and while it's a great attempt it doesn't really show case what Burning Wheel can really do because the player's don't have the right personal attachment to The Beliefs.  I would say, from my very limited experience, that it even HARMS player's perceptions of the game.\n<blockquote><cite>Conversely, I get annoyed with complex story games that expect me to figure out the emergent properties of this unique set of rules on my own.

It's basically a rule book AND strategy guide in one.<br/><br/>My main point, was simply that going from core rule to "how to" elucidation IS a separate step from either design or raw rules presentation.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297857/#Comment_297857" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-21T14:55:03+00:00" title="October 21, 2010  2:55PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there's probably a lot of value in finding that perfect balance between explaining a game's procedures and thoroughly deconstructing their application.<br/><br/>Example: I think one of the reasons the Burning Wheel scene is comprised of such strong advocates is that it takes a lot of experimenting to figure out how the game works. IME you need to play just tons and tons, talk about playing, read about other people playing, and just generally commit yourself to a lot of extracurricular activity. The Adventure Burner goes a long way toward encapsulating that information for BW, but it took five years of ongoing discussion before anyone figured out the game's best practices. But all those fans -- and I count myself among the hardest of the hardcore BW crew here -- have a profound investment in the game that probably would not have arisen if the AdBu stuff had been included in the original text.<br/><br/>I think the same thing happens a lot with Vincent Baker's games, which are designed to create all sorts of emergent behaviors based on (perhaps) inobvious inputs and decisions. If he just came out and *said* how he intended, say, escalation to work in DitV (not just mechanically but dramatically and emotionally), then that conversation would probably not have taken place over many months and years, and fans of the game probably would not be so deeply invested.<br/><br/>And the D&amp;D hardcores, of course, have generated millions of words of analysis, looking at mechanical synergies as well as huge, epic discussions amongst various factions of players as to how best just run the damned thing. D&amp;D would be a very different phenomenon if it had been built around specific procedures, like Apocalypse World. When you DIY, your investment level skyrockets.<br/><br/>I guess I'm not sure that an RPG *should* go beyond its minimum instruction. Or that, like the fruitful void left behind by what the mechanics don't address, there's probably a fruitful void left behind by what the game's instructional text doesn't address.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_298164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nick_Dalton" title="Nick_Dalton"><img alt="Nick_Dalton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dreadcentral.com/img/news/aug06/garthmarenghi2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nick_Dalton">Nick_Dalton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298164/#Comment_298164" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-25T06:01:00+00:00" title="October 25, 2010  6:01AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 25, 2010 6:15AM by Nick_Dalton.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Vladimir on this one.

Or next to it. The only way someone becomes a good writer is to write and write and write and probably also read and read and read and probably also have some talent for it. <br/><br/>However, at the same time, you can teach people all sorts of things about writing. You can, for example, lay out how to write a spectacularly <a href="http://www.paper-dragon.com/1939/dent.html" rel="nofollow">terrible but probably entertaining pulp novel</a>. Or you can lay out the rules of formal structure and the application of Aristotelian plot. <br/><br/>So when we're talking about telling people how to play a game I think we need to find the gap between "I can teach you how to write a cut and paste pulp novel" and "this game must teach you how to write Midnight's Children in order to be a good teaching text." Mostly because I have a feeling people sometimes look at the later, realize the impossibility of it, and so don't even try to do the former -- which is quite possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_298233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298233/#Comment_298233" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-25T17:02:09+00:00" title="October 25, 2010  5:02PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread reminds me to tell you all again:<br/><br/>Read some good books on Poker.

I've included the following side bar in my most recent set of Matrix game rules (now up on my web page <a href="http://hamsterpress.net" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://hamsterpress.net</a> ) It points people to the guidance the game materials give on what to do next. But I find in the PBEM I'm running now that I should tell people to do more in a scene than one thing. They are rivaling for the affections of a beautiful peasant babe and not moving closer to the space ship of the bad guys - It's a Star Trek game).<br/><br/>SIDE BAR \u201cWhat should I make happen?\u201d<br/><br/>It is sometimes hard to decide what to do. There are so many possibilities. To help people out, Matrix games includes materials meant to inspire players. The map shows locations like for instance a mysterious mansion \u2013 what should happen there? Locations have suggestions of what might be encountered there \u2013 a threatening house keeper. Maybe there is an overt question \u2013 What clue do you find? Character sheets describe people and their motives \u2013 how do you carry out their plans? Character sheets also list skills they have \u2013 what happens when they use them? Some games will have a plot track that suggests the sequence of events of a given type of story \u2013 so you find clues before arresting a suspect. The story opener tells players the general situation which begs the question \u2013 what happens next? The same question comes up after each turn when one or more scenes become facts. The game materials include lots of pictures that also can inspire action. The important thing is to pick something to inspire you, look at it and then make up a scene based on what pops into your head. <br/><br/>Chris Engle<br/><br/>Feedback on my sidebar is welcome - and greatly desired!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_298535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafe" title="Rafe"><img alt="Rafe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/580/nVD52VTM5722R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafe">Rafe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298535/#Comment_298535" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-27T17:59:37+00:00" title="October 27, 2010  5:59PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There can be a fine line between 1) just not feeling how things are meant to go or why, 2) that perfect place of getting the gist of how to play and developing one's style and ability to play well over time (Paul's push, I think... and mine), and 3) being given such a complete "how to" that there's really no point in playing (as per your NWN example with the three warrior bowmen).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe issue is hitting that quasi-magical place of grokking the game's overall philosophy and intent without needing to be dragged pedantically to it, which would thus eradicate what enjoyment one would have in playing it and building a rapport (really) with the game and its mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang" title="Tim C Koppang"><img alt="Tim C Koppang" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang">Tim C Koppang</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298599/#Comment_298599" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-28T08:01:04+00:00" title="October 28, 2010  8:01AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>How many layers do you personally expect the author/designer to go?</blockquote>\nI think this is a key question.  Sure the author can explain his game to you, but how much is actually required for productive play?  And how much is too much.  It is possible to overwhelm a new reader so much so that he actually ends up confused.\n<blockquote>My main point, was simply that going from core rule to "how to" elucidation IS a separate step from either design or raw rules presentation.</blockquote>\nYes.  I agree -- to a point.<br/><br/>On the other hand, most games, in actual play, break down into a certain set of procedures and patterns.  You might have to look at play from a top-down, big picture point of view, but, in a successful game, the players are repeating certain general techniques.  I personally think that we, as game designers, need to become stronger in identifying and explaining those patters in our game texts.<br/><br/>Let me give an example.  In Hero's Banner, when I run the game, I follow a pattern.  I take each player in turn, examine his character's Influences, and frame a strong scene loaded with potential conflict based on one or two of those Influences.  We play though the scene.  I try to push towards one of the conflicts that I had in mind when I framed the scene.  We arrive at a conflict, resolve it, and take care of any fallout afterwards.  Scene ends.  Go to the next player.  Repeat.<br/><br/>Yes, there are times when I break this pattern.  In general, however, this is the procedure I use for successful HB play.  Now, does the HB book adequately explain this procedure?  No.  The book isn't terrible.  It sort of explains around the procedures needed to play.  But I think we need more procedural explanations in our game texts.  If we focus on clearing up procedural confusion, many of the problems surrounding emergent behaviors will go away.  It's one of the things I attempted to do better in Mars Colony.<br/><br/>Explaining how to play a narrativist game is difficult because we are attempting to explain how to create theme and art within certain system boundaries, but it is possible if we look at things procedurally.  I will not, for example, be held responsible for the success or failure of the art another group creates with my game so long as they are playing the game according to the procedures I lay out.  As designer, I have to be able to expect a certain level of creative effort from potential players (which includes emergent behaviors to a certain extent).  I will take responsibility if the game procedures are incomplete or the game itself is just a bad set of rules for creating the themes it promises.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_298961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus" title="The_Magus (Banned)"><img alt="The_Magus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus">The_Magus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298961/#Comment_298961" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-01T12:18:16+00:00" title="November  1, 2010 12:18PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What might be helpful is that when actual play examples are used in RPG texts there is some commentary to what is going on in the players' minds in relation to the rules system.  So many books assume that you just get it and Sorcerer is one of the worst for it.

My most recent AP example of how tied up you can get was with Annalise, a great game but we got into double-describing (I was running this in a four hour slot), the Vulnerability mechanism was under-exploited in the game - there was a lot of interesting character development going on but the story did not move.  I want to run it again and can see the error of my ways in certain cases.  Annalise's ruleset is a lot clearer than many and still I ran into difficulty.<br/><br/>I have posted elsewhere about being a psychotherapist and compare some of the procedures of psychotherapy with RPG activity.  Ultimately you're getting people to tell you their story and to be reflexive about it.  Psychotherapy can be seen as a pragmatic endeavour and also an aesthetic one.  I think that the music analogy is a little unhelpful.  No game can guarantee an enjoyable time consistently just as no therapist can guarantee every episode of therapy moving things along.  However, pragmatic activity is always a useful thing if you're stuck although a constant reliance of it robs any game experience of grace, beauty and any other less tangible quality that we also seek in our gaming.<br/><br/>A lot of the texts fail to give indications on the procedures as Tim Koppang puts it.

How would that even read?<br/><br/>I'd like to say "Yes" but appreciate this would be incredibly narrow and unrealistic.  It's interesting that you, Tim, have responded as Mars Colony was a text that I had a lot of trouble with.  The game is very clear pragmatically in generating Health points and the potential difficulty in doing this mathematically.  On page 43 is the statement 'The players must balance what they have created against the constraints of the story they are telling.'  To me that is pretty nebulous.  You are asking for meta-positioning without actually acknowledging it anywhere in the text.  I don't want to sound like I'm having a specific go at you, Tim, as I think there are an awful lot of games out there that make statements like these.  How would I play a game of Mars Colony as The Saviour and want to explore a lot of personal issues for the character with another player who wanted to explore something in a much wider political context via the Parties or Organisations?<br/><br/>I welcome actual play examples (or replays) in RPG text with also some idea from a design perspective about what the designer was hoping to achieve in the creation of aesthetics.

I've been trying to condense the procedural rules to microlite proportions, but these often leave a lot of grey areas or simply parts of the system that seem to be missing. Then I try to explain and add in the details through play examples, with these play examples doing double duty to help flesh out the setting.<br/><br/>I don't think I've been particularly successful with it so far, but I'm getting closer to an adequate result. 2 pages of tight game procedure, expands out to twenty pages of game play examples, then expands further with GM notes, theory behind rule choices, and meta-gaming ideas. Then I've tried to keep the tight 2 pages at the back of the book as a "Quick Play" guide or "Cheat Sheet" for easy reference during play. <br/><br/>I don't know if this post helps, I'm basically just saying that this is an issue I've been trying to deal with for a while as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298986/#Comment_298986" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-01T16:52:44+00:00" title="November  1, 2010  4:52PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Has anyone yet brought up the fact that many (maybe most?) designers don't actually know their own games' "best practices" at the time they typically publish their games? <br/><br/>I was just looking through the Adventure Burner the other day, for example.

The underlying truth of the blank page must be infringed, but it must never altogether disappear - and whatever displaces it might well aim to be as lively and peaceful as it is. It is not enough, when building a title page, merely to unload some big, prefabricated letters into the center of the space, nor to dig a few holes in the silence with typographic heavy machinery and then move on. Big type, even huge type, can be beautiful and useful. But poise is usually far more important than size - and poise consists primarily of emptiness. Typographically, poise is made of white space. Many fine title pages consist of a modest line or two near the top, and a line or two near the bottom, with little or nothing more than taut, balanced white space in between.</blockquote>\nThis is how Bringhurst opens the chapter on Structural Forms &amp; Devices. He opens by making white space and poise matter to the reader. He relates it to what the reader might know, he evokes a visceral scorn for bad practices, and teaches us how to appraise good design. It is only then that he begins to tell us the rules of achieving poise and titling balance.<br/><br/>He's moved past minimum instruction, into the realm of dialogue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298994/#Comment_298994" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-01T18:52:28+00:00" title="November  1, 2010  6:52PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While that is definitely true, I must also point out that <i>Championship</i> is 304 pages, <i>Elements of Typographic Style</i> is 350 pages, and <i>Super System</i> is 605 effing pages. <br/><br/>Writing that much material is tough enough, but editing and laying that out...

It's interesting that you, Tim, have responded as Mars Colony was a text that I had a lot of trouble with.  The game is very clear pragmatically in generating Health points and the potential difficulty in doing this mathematically.  On page 43 is the statement 'The players must balance what they have created against the constraints of the story they are telling.'  To me that is pretty nebulous.  You are asking for meta-positioning without actually acknowledging it anywhere in the text.  I don't want to sound like I'm having a specific go at you, Tim, as I think there are an awful lot of games out there that make statements like these.  How would I play a game of Mars Colony as The Saviour and want to explore a lot of personal issues for the character with another player who wanted to explore something in a much wider political context via the Parties or Organizations?</blockquote>\nMy first reaction to this is to apologize, but that's simply my nature.  When I'm being candid, however, I'd simply challenge you to play the game.  I think you might find that by simply adhering to the procedures of the game, much more of the theme of the game would become apparent to you than you might expect.  This is a good thing because it removes the author's expectations (and the larger community's social expectations) from the mix.  My hope is that the procedures, including things like fear cards, political parties, etc., will help to calibrate the players towards their individual expectations before and during play so that a lot of otherwise superfluous text becomes just that.  (For example, see Gregor's <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php?topic=30606.0" rel="nofollow">recent AP thread</a> on the Forge.)  I recognize that this might not be to everyone's liking, but it does insure that players can get down to play quicker so long as they are willing to take it on a bit of trust that I've done my homework, play-tested the game, and that it all just works (which I think it does quite well).<br/><br/>Remember that Mars Colony is specifically for two players.  A certain dialogue between the players is assumed in the rules.  As game designer, I have to strike a difficult balance between, on the one hand, guiding the players towards a specific kind of theme, and, on the other, hand-holding so much so that I stifle all spontaneous creation.  My stance with Mars Colony was to veer towards a minimalist presentation both graphically and textually to allow the players maximum room to create.  Personally, I've found some recent games have tried too hard to tell me exactly what aesthetic values I am supposed to strive for.  (Please don't take that as an offense.  I mean simply to state a preference.)\n<blockquote>Hmm, I feel a bit put on the spot, or rather I'm now articulating things that need more thought in the context of the work that I do.</blockquote>\nThat's fair.  I won't lie, I meant to put you on the spot a bit because I found your comment interesting.  That said, I am using my own game merely as an example, and I recognize that you are speaking more generally about many games.  Feel free to continue to point to your difficulties with the MC text, or to another game that better supports your argument.  I'm game either way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299005/#Comment_299005" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-01T23:12:17+00:00" title="November  1, 2010 11:12PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tim C Koppang</cite>I take each player in turn, examine his character's Influences, and frame a strong scene loaded with potential conflict based on one or two of those Influences.</blockquote>\nLet me just break this down a little more into a procedure that I think people might be talking about:<br/><br/>Say we have the above sentence in italics at the top of the page.<br/><br/>Then below:<br/><br/>If you're stuck on how to do this, try the following:<br/><br/>1.

If you're having trouble with this, you probably don't understand the Influence.<br/><br/>3. Reply to the character "No - that's not true."  Turn off the faucet and quit wasting water.<br/><br/>4.  Who is saying "No, that's not true"?  You said it in someone's voice, whose is it?  A character in the fiction. Is it someone that already exists? Great. Is it somebody new? Good.  Why are they saying that, how have they come to that conclusion, what are they going to do about it?<br/><br/>5. What they do about it has some immediate effect. Is the player character challenged by the immediate effect? If yes, you now have the scene. If no, then the antagonistic character does more, goes farther, pushes harder.

And you can see then why it might be useful for Player A, it would seem like bloat to Player B.<br/><br/>Here's one way I'm trying to handle the tastes of both players. There is a section explicitly called out as non-procedural "advice" text. It is set apart from "instruction" text by a variety of layout conventions (smaller font size, leading, number of columns, etc.).\n<blockquote>Example: You're in a part of the book where there are are a number of branching options, some of which will call on you to describe a scene. Rather than repeat the same advice in each branch, there is a preface titled "How to Describe a Scene." It is set in an 8pt sans serif while the main instructional text is set in 11pt serif.</blockquote>\nThis is distinct from a typical sidebar because the content isn't quite so tangential to the flow of reading. It's something that is just as important and deserves as much attention to the instruction, but can be visually skipped for those readers already familiar with those details and are now only using the text for reference.\n<blockquote>Example: When you were first learning the game and reading the book, you read the instructional text and the advice text as a single continuous flow. When you go back for reference, you can easily skip the advice because it is so visually distinct.</blockquote>\nThat advice text is split up into a number of subsections concerning particular issues that frequently come up in play. Sections about long-term strategies, when it is appropriate to choose Door 1 or Door 2, optimal decisions to make here or there, and all supported with a peek under the hood of the game system.\n<blockquote>Example: "How to Describe a Scene" is split up into sub-sections like "Describing a Scene Using the Five Senses" "How to Build on Another Player's Contributions" and "When You Should Save or Spend Plot Points."</blockquote>\nNot all this advice is relevant in all branching paths of play, but it is relevant enough that it's useful to have it available all in one place. That advice established, you can continue into the branching paths of instruction and back-reference to specific advice where necessary. This method also allows enough space to write advice text that really is only relevant to branching path 1, 2, or 3, without burdening Branch 1 with advice that is only relevant in Branch 3.\n<blockquote>Example: You're reading a later part of the book concerning one particular branch of play procedure. The instruction says "Describe a scene where the antagonist and your character have a heated argument." The advice section calls back to "How to Build on Another Player's Contributions" and "When You Should Save or Spend Plot Points." It does not call back to "Describing a Scene Using the Five Senses" because it is not especially relevant in this part of play. Furthermore, this part of the book has very specific advice like "How Antagonists Argue" and "In Case Things Turn Violent."</blockquote>\nHaving general advice in one place also allows you to work back references into an example of play.\n<blockquote>Example: Ted is describing his character Tarak getting into a heated argument with Lord Bonecrusher. He's having a little bit of creative block, so he refers back to the advice on page XX. Specifically, he's having trouble deciding the nature of the argument without it turning violent. He sees in "How Antagonists Argue" that the antagonist may have a subordinate do the arguing. That subordinate doesn't have the authority to start a fight, but may shout and gnash teeth viciously. So, Ted describes Lord Bonecrusher leaning back in his throne, shrouded by shadows while his lackey Squick Anklebiter rattles his saber at Tarak.</blockquote>\nThis is one way we might be able to reconcile the amount of space required to go beyond minimum instruction while still being economical with our word count and page count.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299085/#Comment_299085" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-02T18:55:02+00:00" title="November  2, 2010  6:55PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A visual aide would be helpful.

Let me I think all that optional text in the bottom half of the page might still serve to make casual readers wary of the material on a flip-through of the book, even though is serves its purpose of delineating focus and facilitating reference wonderfully. That fear, of scaring off readers who want simple-looking instructions, is not a trivial one. That said, I think making design decisions out of fear is... troublesome, so I'm not recommending that. But a book has to take a stand on how much information it's going to offer versus how much it's going to require. <br/><br/>I think this is curious, and maybe I'm reading into things, but I see an implication that we should go beyond minimum instruction for the sake of starter players so that they can find expertise\u2014as though expertise can be achieved without practice. More text is not necessarily going to help people master their games. It is, in some cases, going to make the game labyrinthine. <br/><br/>Minimal instruction is a perfectly valid design style, as it can be inviting and provocative and curiosity-stoking. We all recognize the difference, right, between minimal instruction and <i>too little</i> instruction? Minimum instruction is minimalism. Too little is just what it says on the tin: too little. Not enough.<br/><br/>So let's do talk more about <i>why</i> and <i>when</i> it's a great design decision to go beyond minimum instruction, in addition to <i>how</i>. Because the borderline between too little information and too much information is sometimes not wide enough to stand on, let's talk about which direction in which to err and why. For my money, the design Daniel is holding up errs on the side of too much\u2014in a wonderful way. It embraces its extra information and presents it with care.<br/><br/>But how do we know when minimalism is too little? I hold up my cardinal sins of storytelling: Boredom and Confusion. Too much is boring, too little is confusing. We must tread the valley in between, and we will have stragglers.<br/><br/>I'm just thinking out loud after supping on this thread and feeling defensive for having worked on "minimum instruction" games in the past.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299096/#Comment_299096" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-02T23:30:07+00:00" title="November  2, 2010 11:30PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 2, 2010 11:30PM by Hans_c-o.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            dur. move along.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_299106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus" title="The_Magus (Banned)"><img alt="The_Magus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus">The_Magus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299106/#Comment_299106" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-03T03:54:29+00:00" title="November  3, 2010  3:54AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 3, 2010 3:55AM by The_Magus.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Will Hindmarch</cite>Dear Daniel Solis,<br/><br/>You are wonderful.<br/><br/>Love,<br/>Will<br/></blockquote>\nI agree - and isn't he good at Latin?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Will Hindmarch</cite>I think this is curious, and maybe I'm reading into things, but I see an implication that we should go beyond minimum instruction for the sake of starter players so that they can find expertise\u2014as though expertise can be achieved without practice.

It reminded me of an article I read relating to the work I do (I work in the field of family therapy).  <br/><br/>An experienced practitioner pointed out that 'it is easier to learn and to teach family therapy via the boundaries of specific frameworks - that one's confidence builds through learning the detail and coherence of frameworks and, with it, the capacity to integrate theory ideas and practice.' (Falicov 1998 in Flaskas 2010)<br/><br/>A coherent framework is always an excellent fall-back position.  I am currently responsible for teaching theory to junior psychiatrists and then co-supervising their practice.  It would not be a good thing for clients or the doctors if I said, "Just go with what feels right.'  Equally, I'm keen that they are not offering a monolithic kind of therapy which obliterates their personalities and creativity.  It is essential to adopt a pragmatic position in order to generate an aesthetic sensibility.<br/><br/>When things get tough in the therapy room it is always useful to have a framework of ideas to fall back on.  I see RPGing as a rather less 'dramatic' version of this.<br/><br/>Will, you are right that expertise cannot be achieved without practice but there is also something questionable about the expert position: that as a novice you are forced into the position of recourse to it.  You learn a bit by playing and then you might be confronted by an expert who says, "Meh."  To clarify, one can lapse into the position of the authority fallacy:  "Yeah, well I suppose you can do that in Dungeons and Dingbats but I wrote the rules and I don't think you've quite understood the nuances on page 17."  <br/><br/>I'm reminded of Gygax saying that his way of playing D&amp;D was really the only way to play D&amp;D.  Beginners do bring to the game a potentially new way of seeing it and playing it.  I'm not sure how useful I've found the process of playing a game, posting something in an AP forum and then having experts pick at it.  Which then leads me onto what is 'expertise\u2019 in role-playing gaming?  A quote that was bandied about when I trained a psychiatric nurse was that you could do your job the same way for 30 years and not adopt any changes unless necessary or you could evolve in the job.<br/><br/>The implication of Robin Laws writing 'Hamlet's Hit Points' suggests to me that people want some instruction and guidance on how to play and GM.  The success of Spirit Of The Century suggests that people are happy to read rulebooks with lots of exposition about play and specific examples and it's 400 pages long!  I appreciate 'minimal instruction' maybe a necessity in a hobby where it seems difficult to earn a living from it and game designers do the job as a passion or labour of love as an aside to their paid employment.  I also feel that the way some of these texts come across isn\u2019t going to draw anyone into the hobby and may instead serve as an alienating experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang" title="Tim C Koppang"><img alt="Tim C Koppang" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang">Tim C Koppang</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299127/#Comment_299127" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-03T07:17:12+00:00" title="November  3, 2010  7:17AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 3, 2010 7:18AM by Tim C Koppang.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Piers,<br/><br/>I can appreciate the fear (?) / frustration (?) about picking up a game, playing it, and wondering if you're "doing it right."  However, I think Will's distinction between a minimalist game presentation and a game that provides too little instruction is a good one.  I'd argue that, in a minimalist presentation, the game itself teaches the players how to play so long as the players are willing to trust in the procedures presented.  In other words, they just have to go play.  Certain expectations should be obvious from the game text.  Other things will quickly reveal themselves as play progresses.  Good examples of this sort of approach include 3:16, Sweet Agatha, and S/lay w/Me.  (I'm guessing, these games are not your favorite game texts?)<br/><br/>Daniel's example of how to integrate procedure with explanation is a fine one, and something that I could see working in certain games.  But it's by no means the only way to do things.  That Spirit of the Century is 400 pages does show that, for a certain market, players are willing to put in the time to read a long text.  But a longer text can also be a barrier to entry for more casual or time-crunched players.  A minimalist presentation lowers the barrier to entry for these players -- if the game is done right.<br/><br/>I'm betting that a casual player is actually more likely to jump right into play, and doesn't want to wade through long texts.  After all, that's what he'd be used to if he, for example, plays boardgames.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_299137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus" title="The_Magus (Banned)"><img alt="The_Magus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus">The_Magus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299137/#Comment_299137" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-03T09:06:49+00:00" title="November  3, 2010  9:06AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Tim<br/><br/>My experience with S/lay w/Me has been a good one.

I liked S/lay w/Me for its 'You/Me' style of its presentation.  Also I'm being told what to do very clearly - the 'Say It' section evokes mood tremendously well.  I like the simple mechanics.  It works for me.  I got a bit stuck with Mars Colony when I bought it (I bought it with Annalise and that took my eye more).  I think I could just not get the impression of how the mechanics meshed together and when conflicts arise then Saviour and Governor must resolve the conflict in an arbitrary way.  I'm also not sure when scenes have served their purpose, or rather playing the game with someone else we may inevitably disagree on this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299152/#Comment_299152" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-03T11:08:36+00:00" title="November  3, 2010 11:08AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Piers, did you play either S/Lay or Mars Colony?

I'm not that easily offended!  And I appreciate your response.  What I'm ultimately trying to get at is this: when does a minimalist game text work, and when is more explanation needed if at all?<br/><br/>During personal and opposition scenes, Mars Colony relies exclusively on drama resolution, which pretty much means that the players have to agree on how the whole scene works out.  I can see how that could cause some head-scratching when you read the book.  In practice, I personally find that it works better than expected, especially in a two-player setting.<br/><br/>To bring this back around to the topic at hand, I will say that, from the author's point of view, it's difficult to know what sort of mechanics the potential reader will be familiar with and what will require extra explanation.

It's just one solution to the persistent problem of trying to appeal to different audiences. As elegant as your game rules might be, there are a lot of emergent properties you could discuss about it. In doing so, you increase the number of words you're putting in a player's eyeballs before they get a chance to play.<br/><br/>I feel like I'm presenting a false dichotomy between "casual player who won't read anything" and "studious player who wants to know a game entirely before playing." Perhaps I am, but only for the sake of discussion. Everyone sits along a different point in the spectrum between those two poles. As a game designer and game writer (and a game layout-er) you have to decide at a certain point whether you want to devote ink and paper to appeal 1%-50% of that spectrum.<br/><br/>Surely there is some reasonable way of saying, "Look, this subject is getting way too specific to spend money putting in print.

Rather it's about making a conscious choice as an author to present more or less text.  Frankly, if I thought it would help, I'd spend the money to print a bigger book regardless of how small-time I am.  Publishing less text is actually more nerve-wracking because there is an expectation that rpg books be long.  There is also less room for error.

This book will be fat, and it will be pricey as a result (I estimate $50+).<br/><br/><i>shotGLASS</i> will be the same book, BUT with anything not a literal, use-this-this-way rule hidden using conditional text. Purely reference, for costs, verbals, effects, and basic math. Enough to actually play, though... if you "put in the work" to build a Game Type, know about LARPing in general and "boffer/Airsoft" LARPs in particular, and have had some exposure to HERO System or similar modular and highly configurable games. It will be a free PDF. (And it's basically already "done" with my System Test Document Gold Master Candidate.)<br/><br/>I figure GM and grognards will buy the book, with the VAST majority of players just getting by with <i>shotGLASS</i>.<br/><br/>And, yes, I will still have forums for follow-on advice and community, AND a Game Type and Character Builder database (which I might end up monetizing, if it becomes too pricey to host). So there's all that support post-read, pre-play AND there's portable reference for use in-game AND there's more advice, examples, and explicit procedural spelling out than you can shake a stick at, if you pony up. Seems the best strategy (and, no, not all that unique to me or GLASS).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
