One wanted me to run <i>them</i> through Eternal Lies, after running <i>me</i> through it, and so that decided it for me.<br/><br/>I decided to keep continuity with my Masks campaign but make this only a loose sequel. I recruited JP to reprise the role of Jimmy Wright, and we were well on our way.<br/><br/>I don't intend to do a full-on reboot of the campaign, but I'm changing lots of stuff already, so I'm not sure where this will end up. Given Pelgrane's entirely understandable desire to preserve some secrets about the campaign, I'm certainly going to change the ending. Whether or not I'll obscure the main campaign mystery is something I'll decide when I get there, and in consultation with some folks I know at Pelgrane.<br/><br/>So that said, I did some of my usual tricks here:<br/><br/>--I made <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw8iFfIRXgBOcm1xcE9PNGlDTFE/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">another custom Fiasco playset</a> to create a prelude backstory for the group.<br/><br/>--As usual, my <i>[GM comments look like this]</i>.<br/><br/>--Let's meet the cast!<br/><br/><b>Jimmy Wright</b><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/images/2417567/JimmyWright__2__square_thumb.png"/><br/><br/>After the events of Masks, Jimmy started one of the most successful PI practices in Los Angeles.

I also imported Networks (as Contacts) and Covers wholesale from those games. (I let the players by points in them using Investigative build points at 3-1.)<br/><br/>I made a "fixed cost" Stability chart as I've found calling for Stability checks, waiting on the attendant calculations, and then tallying the results to be a little tedious in other games I've run. I based the results on the "expected loss" and the normal rational spend, which makes it fairly flat. However, I made sure to keep the original losses on the chart as they affect the maximum loss in a scene.<br/><br/><b>The Fiasco Prelude</b><br/><br/>I based this playset on the adventure "The Final Reel" from <i>Shadows Over Filmland</i>. I can dig out the whole setup, but the important relationships were:<br/><br/><b>Jimmy-Ruby</b>: Assistant producer and Executive Assistant Producer<br/><br/><b>Need</b>: To Get Away With...the terrible special effects<br/><br/><b>Object</b>: the dailies from the day of the "incident"<br/><br/><b>Dr. Orange-Geronimo</b>: Unrequited love and the one who says no. (This seems to have been a confusing time in the doc's life.)<br/><br/>I made everyone generate a link to Janet Rogers, investigative reporter and Jimmy's solace, but they didn't come up all that often, and she's not as important a character as Jax was in the Masks game. (For those of you who wonder, Jax is alive and well and acting under an alias in LA. She hasn't come into the game yet, but there's a possibility.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443227/#Comment_443227" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-25T05:00:27+00:00" title="February 25, 2015  5:00AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2015 5:11AM by Aviatrix.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Prelude: The Casting Call of Cthulhu (Part 1)</b><br/><br/>"No, no, no," said Oliver Ates. "What I want is the tentacles to be waving, like this. Not like that."<br/><br/>"Oliver, tentacles are so <i>20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</i>. The public is tired of it. They want winding." said Ruby Fitzgibbons, assistant to the executive producer (or was it the executive assistant producer?) <br/><br/>"Ruby, this is an artistic matter. It will simply ruin the artistic effect--"<br/><br/>"Ruin it!" said Dr. Julius Orange, the technical adviser. "How are we going to pay for it? I\u2019ve been through this line by line and I don\u2019t see a line saying models."<br/><br/>"It\u2019s simple," said Ruby. "Get some more clay, it will only take a day or two to have winding tentacles. And it will make more sense. Octopi don\u2019t wave, they undulate. The public will see and say, my those tentacles are undulating quite amazingly around that submarine."<br/><br/>"Ruby, dear, there\u2019s no submarine--"<br/><br/>"--yes there is, James and I were talking--"<br/><br/>"A sailboat. A Norwegian sailboat," finished Oliver grumpily.<br/><br/>It was another typical day on the set of <i>The Call of Cthulhu</i>, the overbudget, overschedule, and thoroughly underwhelming epic film being produced on a shoestring in part by Ruby Fitzgibbons. Or at least her family\u2019s money; her family long ago had learned that it was easier to pay for whatever Ruby\u2019s current fancy was rather than have her anywhere close to them.<br/><br/>"Sailboats are so old world," said Ruby. "It should be a U-Boat, that\u2019s so much more modern."<br/><br/>"Ruby, darling, I didn\u2019t write it."<br/><br/>"We talked to the screenwriter. He won\u2019t speak with us anymore, but I feel the conversation we had through the door backs up having a U-Boat and undulating tentacles."<br/><br/>Oliver sighed. "Be a good little German," he said to Julius, "and go make this happen."<br/><br/>Muttering imprecations, Dr. Orange stormed away. <i>I earned a Ph. D. in theoretical physics</i>, he thinks, <i>taught here and in Germany for years, even managed to escape the Nazis, and I end up taking orders from some half-baked Englishman about a rubber monster. California is a very strange place.</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>"Miss Fitzgibbons, I\u2019ve noticed an increase in strange people coming and going on the set," said Geronimo Cuevas, the man most recently assigned to protect Ruby by the studio (the last three had all quit within a week of meeting her).<br/><br/>"Geronimo, we\u2019re in California. They\u2019re all strange."<br/><br/>"What I mean is persons who appear to want to do harm to the film. Or you."<br/><br/>"Ne\u2019er-do-wells? What do you need?"<br/><br/>"I can\u2019t protect the entire studio on my own. I need help."<br/><br/>"I\u2019ll talk to Oliver. We\u2019ll take it out of the special effects, I guess," said Ruby, watching the mechanical tentacles flop back and forth from the head of the twenty-foot high monster prop. "In the meantime, take some petty cash and go hire some out of work people."<br/><br/>"You want me to protect the studio with <i>bums</i>?"<br/><br/>"They prefer to be called Okies, I think. There are some over there on that street corner."<br/><br/><i>[Me: Great, you\u2019re hiring Tom Joad: "Wherever there\u2019s a studio to protect, I\u2019ll be there. For 35 cents a day."]</i><br/><br/>Geronimo sighed to himself and began walking towards the street corner. <i>I have to keep this job</i>, he thought to himself. <i>If I get deported back to Spain, Franco\u2019s goons will have me killed the minute I step foot in my homeland</i>. And some of them, he reflected, knew his real name.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"So what are real cultists like, Mr. Wright?" asked Millicent Lowell.<br/><br/>"They...ooze weirdness, sort of," said Jimmy Wright, private investigator and assistant producer. He pondered again why he had let his friend Janet Rogers talk him into poking around the set to see if there were any <i>actual</i> cultists trying to sabotage the film.<br/><br/>"Are you talking about special effects?"<br/><br/>"No, those tentacles are just horrible."<br/><br/>They stepped out of the sound stage and began to walk across the studio lot. Over by the monster prop, there was a sound of machines wrenching to a halt and Dr. Orange cursing. <br/><br/>"Some cultists look weird, some look quite well-dressed, and in power and control over everything," continued Jimmy. "But they aren\u2019t."<br/><br/>"So anyone you don\u2019t like is a cultist?"<br/><br/>"No, I\u2019ve liked cultists--"<br/><br/>"You <i>like</i> cultists?"<br/><br/>"I don\u2019t like cultists," said Jimmy reflexively. "I, um, misspoke." He pushed away the memory of a certain educated and useful woman who had helped him quite often in the past--and turned out to be a cult leader.<br/><br/>"If I see someone sneaking around, couldn\u2019t they just be a thief?"<br/><br/>"Thieves are bad too. Just sic me on them."<br/><br/>They arrived at the screenwriter\u2019s trailer. Jimmy yanked open the door, and the body of Lee Walling, the screenwriter, tumbled out to the tarmac. Blood from multiple stab wounds covered his back and chest.<br/><br/>Millicent shrieked and ran away.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Millicent ran into a dressing room and slammed the door behind her. Elmer Sedlock, the makeup artist, pulled a chair out for her. She collapsed into it and blurted out the news about Mr. Walling between sobs.<br/><br/>"Oh honey, are you all right? You look so pale. I mean, worse than usual. Did you use that bronzer I gave you?"<br/><br/>"I think we have more problems than getting me a date on Friday night."<br/><br/>"Girl, we\u2019re not even <i>close</i> to that point yet. Honestly, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m even trying..."<br/><br/>"But, Mr. Walling, he was <i>actually</i> dead, and looked so terrible. Not like your dead bodies."<br/><br/>"Well, I\u2019m a genius, and this was just some stupid murderer."<br/><br/>"But why would anyone want to kill a writer?"<br/><br/>"Oh sweetie, you really haven\u2019t been on a set very long, have you?"<br/><br/>"But writers don\u2019t have any power! The directors and special effects guys and geniuses like you are more important."<br/><br/>"Are you sure it wasn\u2019t suicide? Because I\u2019ve known some writers, and frankly..."<br/><br/>"He probably couldn\u2019t stab himself that many times."<br/><br/>"Well, why are you coming to me? I don\u2019t know anything about dead bodies! Oh, all right, I did work as a mortician\u2019s aide for a few months..."<br/><br/>"Really? What was that like?"<br/><br/>"Normally I say kinky, but you don\u2019t look like that kind."<br/><br/>"The bodies...have kinks in them after they die?"<br/><br/>"You are just a <i>treasure</i>," said Elmer as Millicent slumped over and passed out. He sighed and called the emergency contact number the studio had given him, with stern instructions to use it whenever Millicent was in any trouble. <i>A whole lot of trouble to go through for an orphan who goes to school out East</i>, he thought to himself.<br/><br/>The phone rang, and then a man with a rich baritone voice picked up. "Bradley Grey."<br/><br/>Elmer gulped and took a deep breath. "Uh, Senator Grey? We have a little trouble at the studio..."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Geronimo Cuevas, waiting for the police to arrive, suddenly saw Dr. Orange running up to him.<br/><br/>"Did you hear the terrible news?" said the scientist.<br/><br/>"What news do you speak of?"<br/><br/>"Somebody\u2019s been murdered!" Julius clutched Geronimo to him. The Spaniard deftly disengaged from his embrace and lit a cigarette.<br/><br/>"What was she thinking?" he muttered. "Hiring <i>Okies</i>."<br/><br/>"I know! If you were there, I know you\u2019d be able to stop them....you know, I bought you that sweater, but I never see you wearing it. I buy you gifts all the time, but--"<br/><br/>"It wasn\u2019t my color," snapped Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Right, you told me your favorite color was green."<br/><br/>"Khaki."<br/><br/>"Khaki, right! Stupid, so stupid! Well, what are we going to do? Between my brains and your...virility...we should be able to solve this. Have you ever seen a dead body?"<br/><br/>"More than you can imagine."<br/><br/>"Well maybe you can tell us something about how he died..."<br/><br/>"I\u2019m not a detective. My only job is to protect Miss Fitzgibbons."<br/><br/>"Oh, you are impossible!" said Julius before he ran away in frustration. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443228/#Comment_443228" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-25T05:06:14+00:00" title="February 25, 2015  5:06AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Prelude: The Casting Call of Cthulhu (Part 2)</b><br/><br/>"How can we stop filming!" shouted Oliver. "I don\u2019t care that the writer\u2019s dead! He didn\u2019t do anything anyway!"<br/><br/>"A man has died," said Geronimo calmly. "The police must be notified."<br/><br/>"Of course we\u2019ll call the police but that\u2019s no reason to stop  -  You there! Get back to work, you lazy bastards."<br/><br/>"A dangerous man is among us."<br/><br/>"I know who it is, it\u2019s Warren. That man\u2019s line readings could bore anyone to death. Fine, I guess we\u2019ll have to halt filming for the day. You know how much it costs to stop filming for a day? Five thousand dollars! You can tell her that."<br/><br/>"Miss Fitzgibbons has been known to spend that on her breakfast."<br/><br/>"Really? I must make it a point to get to know her better."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy, Millicent and Ruby got together in Ruby\u2019s office to discuss the current state of disaster on the set.<br/><br/>"We\u2019re having some problems on set," said Ruby. "I hear the tentacles aren\u2019t working that well. And the writer had an accident."<br/><br/>"An accident?" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"He fell on a knife. Now we have some important things to work on. I\u2019m thinking...subtext. Our lead has an abusive father..."<br/><br/>"Oh, that\u2019s so sad, Miss Fitzgibbons."<br/><br/>"And if she has an abusive father, when she defeats the Honolulu monster by ramming it with a U-Boat, that\u2019s like defeating her father."<br/><br/>Jimmy and Millicent both stared at her.<br/><br/>"What?" said Ruby. "The movie is named <i>Calling Honolulu</i>, right?"<br/><br/>"<i>The Call of Cthulhu</i>, Miss Fitzgibbons," said Millicent. "And I think it\u2019s about Easter Island..."<br/><br/>"That\u2019s a strange name. Is it Dutch? Anyway, Easter Island is better. It\u2019s rebirth! And she could be pregnant!"<br/><br/>"You\u2019re a genius!"<br/><br/>"Thank you. Now, I\u2019m going to lunch, just have a 10 page outline ready for me when I get back."<br/><br/>"Did I just get assigned a term paper to help write the movie?"<br/><br/>"Get that nice German fellow, the professor, to help you. I want some of that nice physics mumbo jumbo in there. Carbon...Titanium...Molecules. Get all that. The science people love that. How about this--the U-Boat is made out of <i>antimolecules</i>! That\u2019s how it defeats the father-figure Canalulu."<br/><br/><br/><br/>"Are you sure it\u2019s him?" said Jimmy, pouring himself a drink in Ruby\u2019s trailer.<br/><br/>"Of course it\u2019s him," said Janet Rogers, ace investigative reporter formerly of the Los Angeles <i>Mirror.</i> She had recently divorced herself from both the paper and her husband, its editor.<br/><br/>"You\u2019ve established me wrong many times," said Jimmy, handing her a drink.<br/><br/>"Well, aren\u2019t you a private investigator? Haven\u2019t you found any evidence?"<br/><br/>The door opens and Geronimo Cuevas stepped inside. "How can you help me?" he asked. "Frankly, these Okies aren\u2019t doing anything."<br/><br/>"I know you have them," said Jimmy, closing the door behind Geronimo. "The dailies. We have reason to believe that the murderer of Lee is on them." <br/><br/>"Oliver always likes to keep the cameras running," said Janet. "The man\u2019s a walking fire hazard with all that film around him." <br/><br/><i>[Silver nitrate film was highly flammable. It also had the most marvelous black balance.]</i><br/><br/>"Then I will hand them right over," said Geronimo. "But the police need to see them." <br/><br/>"It\u2019s not the time to go to the police just yet," said Jimmy. "Trust me on this. It\u2019s a little weird and a lot complicated. It will...blow their minds."<br/><br/>"What does that mean?"<br/><br/>"That\u2019s complicated too. Just give them to me, and I\u2019ll give them back at the end of the day."<br/><br/>"I\u2019m not sure--" began Geronimo. Suddenly there was a horrific scream from the direction of the giant mechanical monster.<br/><br/>They rushed over to it and found one of the special effects technicians <i>impaled</i> on a tentacle.<br/><br/>"The...undulations..." he whispered before dying.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"I have no idea what happened," said Millicent. "She told me to rewrite the script."<br/><br/>"So write it, then," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"But the science has to be right!"<br/><br/>"The science <i>does</i> have to be right. What does this crazy woman want this time?"<br/><br/>"She says...Cthulhu...is hit by a U-Boat...made of antimolecules...does that mean anything, Professor?"<br/><br/>"Of course it doesn\u2019t, but let\u2019s pretend."<br/><br/>Outside, several people started running towards the mechanical Cthulhu. "Quiet!" barked the Professor. "I\u2019m trying to work!" He busily started scribbling on Millicent\u2019s draft.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Geronimo found Ruby being helped out of her car by her chauffeur. "Miss Fitzgibbons, I was approached by that Jimmy and Janet. They said the man who murdered Lee is on the dailies. But they want to hold on to them instead of giving them to the police."<br/><br/>"Well, that\u2019s not good. Murderers can\u2019t go free. You should call the police--I hear the LAPD are very nice."<br/><br/>"Could you make that call on my behalf?"<br/><br/>"I\u2019m far too busy--why, the special effects man is playing that he\u2019s been hurt by the tentacles. So dramatic. But fine, I\u2019ll call the District Attorney, he\u2019s a dear."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Not long after, Bernie Ohls, the platinum-haired Chief Investigator for the DA\u2019s office arrived. "Jimmy! I got called down to this rathole."<br/><br/>"Bernie! You know how it ends up..."<br/><br/>"What the hell is <i>that</i> thing? Are those tentacles...undulating?"<br/><br/>"Don\u2019t ask."<br/><br/>"Lieutenant Ohls," said Geronimo, "there has been a murder on our set. I have been informed by Se\xf1or Wright that the murderer is capture on our film and I wanted to hand them over for proper custody of evidence."<br/><br/>"Is this for real?" Ohls asked Jimmy.<br/><br/>"You know how sometimes I get those really weird cases? This is kind of one of them. I wanted to save you the trouble."<br/><br/>"Well, I can take care of them. Oh, Phil wants to have dinner next week.

Just because we don\u2019t understand it, doesn\u2019t mean they break physics."<br/><br/>"Well, how could they <i>really</i> move that way, then?"<br/><br/>"Even if I could make it happen, people will never believe it!"<br/><br/>"When you think of tentacles from outer space," said Ruby to the extra in the silk robe, "do you picture <i>these</i> kinds of tentacles, or other kinds of tentacles?"<br/><br/>"Oh, I picture much more interesting tentacles than this. Were you going to help me with my lines?"<br/><br/>"Yes, I\u2019ll help you with them. Go ahead."<br/><br/>"<i>Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn</i>!" he shouted.<br/><br/>"That\u2019s not in the script! We did all the alien gibberish as backwards German, so it would be scary."<br/><br/>"Trust me, this will help with your special effects."<br/><br/>"How? Tell me, move me, make me see."<br/><br/>"I will help make this idol...this special effect...seem to live."<br/><br/>"That\u2019s good. Now, have you taken a look at the anti-molecules? I think they should be blue."<br/><br/>"Yes, yes. But I require one more thing of you."<br/><br/>"What?"<br/><br/>"Your blood!"<br/><br/>The man lunged forward and stabbed Ruby in the shoulder. Ruby screamed.<br/><br/><br/>Jimmy was still trying to convince Bernie to not take the dailies with him when they heard Ruby\u2019s scream. They ran towards the giant Cthulhu prop. <br/><br/>"Miss Fitzgibbons, I\u2019ve failed you!" shouted Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Yes, you have," said the cultist in a sepulchral voice. He advanced on Jimmy. <br/><br/>Jimmy tackled the cultist as Geronimo pulled Ruby to safety.<br/><br/>"Jimmy Wright, we owe you!" said the cultist, as he and Jimmy rolled in the dirt. <br/><br/>A shot barked out.<br/><br/>"That is not dead which can eternal lie..." rasped the cultist as he perished.<br/><br/>Jimmy rolled the bleeding corpse of the cultist off of him and stood up to see Geronimo neatly tuck away a snub-nosed revolver.<br/><br/><br/>"...and then Jimmy shot him," said Millicent to Janet in a booth at Musso and Franks. "And he was one of those cultist guys Jimmy was talking about! and why are all there all these dead bodies? why are these people <i>doing</i> these things? I mean, I heard Hollywood is really cutthroat but I thought they meant that metaphorically!"<br/><br/>"Well, look at it this way," said Janet, lighting a cigarette, "at least you got school credit."<br/><br/><br/>Some weeks later, Roland "Freddie" Holmwood, head of Earl Pictures, watched "THE END?" swim up on the screen of his private theater. <br/><br/>"Well sir?" asked his assistant.<br/><br/>"What a dreadful load of rubbish. Pass."<br/><br/><br/>Geronimo Cuevas got a job as Ruby\u2019s bodyguard, which was less dangerous than chasing Fascists in the streets of Madrid, but hardly less annoying. To avoid any immigration hassles, he let everyone believe it was Jimmy who had shot the cultist.<br/><br/>Ruby decided to quit show business and spent the next year breathlessly telling people about her encounter with a madman.<br/><br/>Dr. Orange used the contacts he made on set to secure a hefty grant that allowed him to travel and pursue his own theories without needing to teach.<br/><br/>Jimmy Wright chalked it up to another bunch of crazy cultists, and became closer to Janet Rogers.<br/><br/>And Janet Rogers decided to start investigating more paranormal cases. She happened to be sitting on a hell of a story...<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443230/#Comment_443230" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-25T05:08:38+00:00" title="February 25, 2015  5:08AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2015 5:09AM by Aviatrix.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Part One: The Long Road Out of Eden</b><br/><br/><b>Episode I: The Girl From Yesterday (Part 1)</b><br/><br/>Here\u2019s a thing I don\u2019t understand about happy endings. People always say they want them. Don\u2019t give them one and they get all mad at you, tear up the book, walk out of the theater cursing, try to punch the guy running the projector. But what I don\u2019t get is, what happens after? Is Elizabeth never going to get mad at Darcy for spending yet another day hunting instead of visiting her father? Viola never going to take the Duke to task for going out drinking? Is Ginger ever going to want to tell Fred to just give it a rest, already, and spend an afternoon not practicing for once?<br/><br/>I mean, what happens after the final curtain falls, the horse rides into the sunset, that last long Vaseline-lensed kiss? Do heroes get to live a life redeemed from all the ordinary problems and indignities? Do they keep having madcap adventures, screwball mixups, constant near misses with death? Or is it just that having paid in so much tragedy and adventure they\u2019ve finally earned the right to have an ordinary life from now on?  <br/><br/>And is that supposed to be a reward?<br/><br/>Anyway, it reminds me of a guy I know. Maybe you\u2019ve heard of him too.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In January, 1937, they tell me, there was a ball in downtown Los Angeles for all the dedicated people of local law enforcement. Quite a few of the local bigshots were there, from the Mayor and the Chief of Police to the freshman Senator from California, Bradley Grey. J. Edgar Hoover himself came down from Washington to hand out awards. Probably also to schmooze and dig up dirt on everyone, but Edgar was always a snoop.<br/><br/>Jimmy Wright was there of course, up on the big table itself. He almost choked himself when he got named Civilian Investigator of the Year. He shouldn\u2019t have been surprised, you know. The fix was already in.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Down in Eddie Mars\u2019 casino--illegal, and underground, which must be why so many off-duty cops hung out there--Ruby Fitzgibbons was playing roulette. She had a huge pile of chips in front of her, and she was letting it ride, of course. Ruby always liked to let things ride.<br/><br/>Her bodyguard, Geronimo Cuevas, lounged against the table nonchalantly, staring at nothing. He looked bored, and sleepy, and about as gentle as a puma.<br/><br/>"Madam, I have to check with Mr. Mars about accepting this bet," the croupier said in an apologetic tone somewhere between a polite cough and a church whisper.<br/><br/>"That\u2019s all right, I\u2019m playing on account anyway," said Ruby.<br/><br/>The croupier looked towards the entrance to the gambling room. A grey-haired man in evening clothes nodded at him. <br/><br/>The croupier picked up the ball, and spun the wheel lightly, almost nonchalantly. The wheel began to turn swiftly. He released the ball and it began to clatter over the spokes.<br/><br/>Slowly the wheel spun to a stop. The ball tumbled into a space. The red number 14 slot.<br/><br/>"I\u2019m sorry ma\u2019am, it\u2019s red. I\u2019m afraid you lost."<br/><br/>"I\u2019ll bring the car around," said Geronimo in Ruby\u2019s ear.<br/><br/>"I\u2019ll simply settle up my bets for now," said Ruby to the croupier. "I\u2019m sure we can deal with this diplomatically. Quietly."<br/><br/>"Indeed. I\u2019m sure Mr. Mars will not need to send any...collection agents."<br/><br/>"Of course not. He\u2019s a civilized man, there\u2019s no need for such things."<br/><br/>"We all hope so, madam. We all hope so."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dr. Julius Orange (born Oraanje, but that\u2019s immigration for you) was burning the midnight oil in his office at Caltech, working on the latest insoluble problem in applied aerodynamics. It wasn\u2019t the hardest, or the last problem he\u2019d ever face. I can tell you there\u2019s always a harder one. And sometimes there\u2019s not a clever solution to be found.<br/><br/>But that\u2019s Julius. He never gave up easy.<br/><br/>Dr. Max Born, his old friend from Germany and colleague at Caltech, stooped into the office. "Hello, Julius, still working on that airflow problem?"<br/><br/>"Ja, I just can\u2019t figure it out. The President asked me to work on these things, I don\u2019t know why."<br/><br/>"Tell me about it. I\u2019m involved in a project that...well...of course I can\u2019t tell you about it." Born paused, and cleaned his glasses with his handkerchief. "Do you ever wonder," he said slowly, "if maybe we\u2019re working on things we\u2019re not meant--"<br/><br/>"No, no. The scientific mind is our key aspect. There is no limit to what we can discover with our brain. I mean, I like this Roosevelt, although he seems a bit lazy, always sitting around. Now, his cousin, there was a man! But this one has a mind."<br/><br/>"Didn\u2019t he have polio?"<br/><br/>"I\u2019ve heard the rumors, I think the papers are just being nice to him."<br/><br/>"Well, an intellectual doesn\u2019t need to be an athlete."<br/><br/><br/><br/>And down near Malibu, on the edge of the canals of Venice, mercifully upwind from the oil derricks, Millicent Lowell and twenty of her classmates were streaming into a very large Victorian style house. The girls were all chattering to each other. Some were planning to sneak out to the boardwalk that night, to meet the hard boys and sailors on leave and even zoot suiters.<br/><br/>But not Millicent. She was ordinary, not adventurous at all, even though she could shake a tail better than an NKVD agent and move quieter than a ballerina in foam shoes. But she wouldn\u2019t waste that on sneaking down to the beach. She wasn\u2019t that kind of a girl; she was just a nice, ordinary, all-American girl. And that should\u2019ve told you something.<br/><br/>Vanessa Brady, the lovable eccentric and relative of some kind to a Senator\u2019s wife, greeted all the girls at the door. She pulled Millicent out and showed her up to her room, which was totally ordinary. Maybe a bit small. Devoid of anything personal, of course, blander than a hotel run by Shriners.<br/><br/>"It\u2019s so good to see you," said Vanessa, straightening Millicent\u2019s hair.<br/><br/>"You too. Holly didn\u2019t make the trip with us. They said she had the flu."<br/><br/>"That\u2019s not what I heard. I heard they sent her to one of those, one of those sp-sp-special hospitals."<br/><br/>"What? Why?"<br/><br/>"I don\u2019t know, was she sick? Maybe she had nervous exhaustion? Anyway, they sent her to a, a place in Georgia somewhere."<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443329/#Comment_443329" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T14:51:31+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  2:51PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode 1: The Girl From Yesterday (Part 2)</b><br/><br/>Jimmy Wright, clutching his award--a sheet of bulletproof glass with his name engraved on it--to his chest, moodily watched the streetlamps pass by through the windows of his car.<br/><br/>"Congratulations, Mr. Wright!" said his driver, a perky young thing from Manhattan, Kansas named Betty Auckland.<br/><br/>"Thanks."<br/><br/>"So Mr. Wright, any chance I could become an investigator for real yet?"<br/><br/>"You pass that test?"<br/><br/>"Well, gee, Mr. Wright, I haven\u2019t had a chance to yet. But I was hoping that maybe in the meantime I could do some jobs for you."<br/><br/>"Sure, I have this one job, it would be perfect for you. But you should really pass that test, it will make your life easier."<br/><br/>They pulled up to the building housing the offices of Wright-O\u2019Donnell Investigations. Betty ran out and opened the door. "Thanks, Mr. Wright! Have a good night!"<br/><br/>Jimmy rode the elevator up to his floor alone. He got out and opened the glass doors to the offices, walking down the long, silent rows of desks that stretched away into the darkness. There was a pool of light up ahead--the night receptionist\u2019s desk. Jimmy waved greeting to her and then stepped through the double doors to his office.<br/><br/>It was a spacious room, with a sunken seating area for having meetings, or sitting with a drink and contemplating things. Large windows looked out over Los Angeles, the far away hills seeming to brood over the city this night. Jimmy went to the bar, made himself a drink, and then walked over to a tall mahogany cabinet. He fished out a key on a long chain hooked to his belt and unlocked the doors.<br/><br/>The interior lit up as he opened the cabinet. Inside were glass shelves holding odd little bits and pieces--scraps of notes, a chart of the Indian Ocean, some fragments of pottery. A strange amulet made of something that looked like bronze was carefully hung up in the back; its smooth, unadorned surface reflected his distorted image back to him. Jimmy picked up a framed photo showing a large group of people gathered on the deck of a ship, probably a decrepit old freighter. In the front row was a younger version of himself, one arm draped over the back of a little girl.<br/><br/>Something flickered behind him.<br/><br/>He closed and locked the cabinet and turned around slowly. Sitting on his desk was a small package wrapped in plain brown paper.<br/><br/>It hadn\u2019t been there when he came in.<br/><br/>He sat down behind the desk and pressed the call button with a trembling finger. "Laura?"<br/><br/>"Yes, Mr. Wright?"<br/><br/>"There\u2019s a package in here..."<br/><br/>"Yes, Mr. Wright. I put it in there before you came in."<br/><br/>Jimmy wiped the sweat off of his hands and picked up the package. Something heavy was rattling around inside it.<br/><br/>He slowly undid the wrapping. Inside was a small box. He lifted the lid and found a post card on the top.<br/><br/>The picture showed some strange rocket rising up on a pillar of flame and smoke above a flat landscape near a shore. In red script in the upper left corner was written "Cape Kennedy, Florida."<br/><br/> He\u2019d have thought it was some cover from a pulp magazine, except that it was a photograph. A color photograph.<br/><br/>On the back, in a crabby printed handwriting, there was a message:<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Dear Jimmy  -  <br/><br/>You\u2019ll want this, eventually.<br/><br/>-- K<br/><br/>PS Say yes to her, though you\u2019ll regret it.<br/><br/>PPS This is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">third</span> time I\u2019ve saved your life. Be more careful!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy gulped. He had known somebody who used the initial K once, long ago. But it couldn\u2019t be him...<br/><br/>Then he saw the address:<br/><br/><br/>James Wright, Esq.<br/>The Mason Building<br/>Los Angeles, Calif.<br/>20th Century<br/>Earth, Milky Way<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy opened the box. He pulled back some tissue paper inside it, revealing a strange dagger with a long thin blade of some kind of bronze material and a handle shaped like the head of an ibis. The blade was caked in in places with some kind of dried black ichor.<br/><br/>Jimmy dialed Ruby\u2019s number with shaking fingers.<br/><br/>"<i>James</i>. How <i>are</i> you? My shoulder has never been the same since that awful attack, don\u2019t you remember..."<br/><br/>"That was almost a year ago...listen, have you ever come across a style of dagger, ibis head for a handle, long blade?" He gave a few other details about the strange artifact.<br/><br/>"Clearly Egyptian, perhaps Fourth Dynasty?"<br/><br/>Jimmy gulped. "Egyptian, sure."<br/><br/>"You should be careful, they can carry <i>curses</i> you know."<br/><br/>"My lucky rabbit\u2019s foot keeps me safe."<br/><br/>"Well, you never know, one day you may need the rest of the rabbit."<br/><br/>"I am the rest of the rabbit," said Jimmy distractedly. "I just wanted to confirm--"<br/><br/>"Its Egyptian origins?"<br/><br/>"...its origins in general."<br/><br/>"You seem...<i>perturbed</i>."<br/><br/>"Me? No, no. Are you going to Grey\u2019s holiday party?"<br/><br/>"Of course. Has something strange happened?"<br/><br/>"No, no, I\u2019m perfect, Miss Fitzgibbons. I\u2019ll see you at the party." Jimmy rang off quickly. <br/><br/>He had hardly replaced the phone in its cradle when his intercom buzzed. "Mr. Wright? Mrs. Rogers to see you."<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443330/#Comment_443330" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T14:53:05+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  2:53PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode 1: The Girl From Yesterday (Part 3)</b><br/><br/>Jimmy stood up as Janet Rogers came through the doors of his office. She was dark-haired, with the kind of plain good looks that added up to a lot more than the sum of their parts. Maybe it was her eyes, almost black in the dim light, with a smolder in them. They were constantly glancing around, taking everything in with swift, light glances. Jimmy knew however that when the fixed on something her glare was hot, inquisitive, and as direct as any man\u2019s.  <br/><br/>He took her wrap and offered her a chair, but she remained standing, almost in a reverie. She picked up the glass trophy and fingered it with one gloved hand. <br/><br/>"Drink?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Mm-hmm." She put down the award and looked up at him. "Well, Jimmy, are you still a private investigator, or are all these awards just for show?"<br/><br/>"About half are just for show. I still get my feet wet once in a while."<br/><br/>"There\u2019s something I\u2019d like you to look into."<br/><br/>"This isn\u2019t going to be like the last time, is it?"<br/><br/>"The movie? I hope not." She sat down in front of the desk and took a cigarette out of a silver case. She waited for Jimmy to light it, took a deep puff, and then looked up at him sharply. "The thing is, this needs to be totally off books, you understand? I don\u2019t want this to be an official investigation of Wright-O\u2019Donnell Investigations. So you can\u2019t use your regular people."<br/><br/>"Well, J. J. will be upset, but it happens. What\u2019s going on?"<br/><br/>"Why don\u2019t you get some people you trust together and we\u2019ll talk at Bradley\u2019s holiday party. Just keep it hush-hush until then."<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Grey mansion was down in Orange County, surrounded by farms that were in the process of being turned into subdivisions. It sat in between a couple of low hills, with a genuine orange grove in the back, along with a nine-hole golf course, a track and stables for the Arabians Mrs. Grey bred, and a swimming pool the 7th Fleet could have done maneuvers in. <br/><br/>The house itself was brand new, although an enormous amount of money had been spent to make it look like a three or four century old manor house--the kind my Duke of Dundersly might have considered an adequate little <i>pied \xe1 terre</i> for entertaining during the summer. The Senator\u2019s wife had wanted something to remind her of her girlhood summers in England, before her feckless brother got himself killed and she\u2019d had to take charge of her parents\u2019 industrial conglomerate.<br/><br/>The Greys called it a holiday party, but nobody could quite figure out what holiday happened on January 14. The hosts always laughed it off  as a way to make sure nobody could snub them with the excuse that they had another party to attend.<br/><br/>As she did with most pursuits dear to her heart, Mrs. Erica Carlyle Grey spared no expense on preparations. An enormous Christmas tree, dragged with great difficulty from the far side of the Sierra Nevada, dominated the three-story high entrance hall, its top almost brushing the ceiling. Elegantly dressed servants buzzed around the guests, offering dainties prepared by chefs straight from the Cordon Bleu. The champagne was cold, the whiskey old enough to get drafted, and both were flowing like water. The one odd note was the large amount of teenaged girls, wearing the uniforms of various toney East Coast schools, milling around in giggling clumps. Veterans of the Greys\u2019 parties told newcomers, sometimes in a conspiratorial whisper, that the Greys were great patrons of the education of women, and that every year they brought <i>hundreds</i> of girls out to California every year over the holidays--the ones whose parents were overseas, or even <i>orphans</i>, the poor dears.<br/><br/>To this party were invited, of course, rich dilettantes and their bodyguards, famous private eyes and their investigative reporter escorts, and scientists on the Department of War\u2019s dole. That is to say, Ruby, Geronimo, Jimmy, Janet, and Julius. And, of course, Millicent, who was with her classmates.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ruby was holding court to a coterie of hangers-on and sycophants.<br/><br/>"He was a horribly deformed man," she said, "with eyes like flame! His breath smelled like a carnivore\u2019s, blood and flesh. He leapt on me, his knife flashing terribly in the sun! Fortunately Geronimo was there to rescue me. He stayed with me the entire ride to the hospital. Which was bumpy, and hurt more. James! How good to see you! I was just telling people about our little adventure on the movie."<br/><br/>"I remember that guy being only about five feet tall," said Jimmy Wright.<br/><br/>"Don\u2019t you think we should try to resurrect the project? I know we had a few difficulties..."<br/><br/>"No, thank you. My producing days are behind me."<br/><br/>"You could get Cukor to direct," offers a ravishingly handsome man hovering near Ruby, waiting for her drink to run out so he could fetch her a new one. He usually didn\u2019t have to wait long.<br/><br/>"Dr. Orange!" said Ruby, waving to the professor. "Are you doing anything important? I know you enjoyed working on that monster we built."<br/><br/>She was careful to ignore the full-body wince that convulsed the professor. "Didn\u2019t I see something in one of the science magazines about those <i>anti-molecules</i>?" she continued. "It was your idea to add them to film, wasn\u2019t it?"<br/><br/>"I need a drink," said Dr. Orange. He trailed after one of the butlers.<br/><br/>"Tell me about this dagger," said Ruby to Jimmy. "Don\u2019t keep a girl waiting."<br/><br/>"I wasn\u2019t aware I was. It...brought back bad memories to me."<br/><br/>"Well where did it come from."<br/><br/>"Egypt."<br/><br/>"Well, yes, originally, but where did you get it from? Was it slammed into a doorframe? Or left in some kind of <i>mysterious package</i>?"<br/><br/>"It was left in a mysterious package...on my desk."<br/><br/>"How macabre! Tell me more! Was there a note! Or no note, that would be even more interesting! Tell me! Jimmy, why aren\u2019t you saying anything!"<br/><br/>"There was a note, from a friend."<br/><br/>"A friend of yours sent a mysterious package? So you could identify it for him--or her--or <i>they</i>? Is there a they?"<br/><br/>"It...depends. Sort of switches around...think of it as an organization. Run by one person."<br/><br/>"A public organization or a private organization?"<br/><br/>"Private. Very private."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Millicent dragged Janet into a corner. "A friend of mine said she had a case of the flu but she\u2019s actually in a hospital. How can I find out more about her, and whether she\u2019s all right?"<br/><br/>"Well, that depends on where she is, and of course confidentiality would make it difficult...so, how soon do you need this by? I can talk to my people."<br/><br/>"I\u2019m here another week. I just heard she had nervous exhaustion..."<br/><br/>"Do you know where the hospital is?"<br/><br/>"Somewhere in Georgia."<br/><br/>"Georgia. Are you sure about that?"<br/><br/>"Yes, I think."<br/><br/>"Don\u2019t go anywhere."<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443331/#Comment_443331" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T14:54:09+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  2:54PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode 1: The Girl From Yesterday (Part 4)</b><br/><br/>Janet found Jimmy with Ruby, Geronimo and Dr. Orange.

So it occurred that I should, I don\u2019t know, hire a private investigator."<br/><br/>"Well, if she\u2019s tied in to this, she needs to be protected," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Indeed. Let\u2019s go to the library. Fetch Millicent, there\u2019s a good man, Jimmy."<br/><br/>Jimmy found Millicent banging out ragtime on one of the Grey\u2019s several pianos, providing cover for her schoolmates while they plundered a liquor cabinet. Jimmy listened to the music for a while, smiling at the girls\u2019 clumsy attempts to hid bottles of booze under their jackets. Something about Millicent\u2019s playing reminded him of something, or someone...but the memory couldn\u2019t fight its way through the heavy, smoke-filled air and the two cocktails Ruby had pressed on him.<br/><br/>Millicent hit a flourishing finish. "Come on," said Jimmy, "Janet and I would like to talk to you." They walked down a long hallway carpeted with a carpet thick enough to lose your glasses in.<br/><br/>"I\u2019m really worried about her," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Who?"<br/><br/>"Helen. Didn\u2019t Janet talk to you about her? I thought that\u2019s why you wanted to speak to me. She said she had the flu but I found out she\u2019s in a mental hospital in Georgia."<br/><br/><br/>They walked into Senator Grey\u2019s law library. Jimmy closed the doors behind them and the sound level plummeted in the room. <br/><br/>Ruby was perched on an overstuffed leather armchair. Geronimo was in a corner, mostly in the shadows, his gleaming eyes watching the doors and doing a casual sweep over Jimmy to see if he was armed. Dr. Orange was sitting at one of the reading desks, idly flipping through a popular science magazine.<br/><br/>Janet was pacing back and forth in the center of the room. One of the green-shaded ceiling lamps was almost directly above her, and she kept stepping into and out of its light, the sequins of her evening gown flashing and dying as she did. She held a drink in one hand and an unlit cigarette in a long black holder in the other. Jimmy pulled out an elegant silver lighter and lit it for her.<br/><br/>"So, Georgia," he said quietly.<br/><br/>"Yes, Georgia," said Janet, distractedly at first and then glancing sharply at Jimmy. "I must say, I\u2019m happy you chose the doctor, I would have recommended you do so if you hadn\u2019t. He might be very useful on this."<br/><br/>She put the drink down and took a long drag on her cigarette. "Have any of you ever heard of Walter Winston?"<br/><br/>"A composer, wasn\u2019t he?" said Ruby. "Did silent film scores, right? I haven\u2019t heard anything by him for a while."<br/><br/>"Well, he just died," said Janet. "He was German, you know, born Walther Wahnstein. Came over around the turn of the century. But back in the twenties he was involved in...well, I don\u2019t have a better word for it. An incident."<br/><br/>"An incident?" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"In 1926 a rather strange thing happened right here in Los Angeles. It was right around that blackout--you probably don\u2019t remember, Jimmy, I don\u2019t think you were out here back then. It seems that out on some farm in the Valley, there was a gunfight. Several people died."<br/><br/>"Bootleggers?" asked Millicent.<br/><br/>"Well, that\u2019s what everyone <i>thought</i>. The police never charged anyone with any crimes. Maybe it was covered up. Winston seems to have been involved somehow. And this seems to be why he stopped composing. He left a lot of interesting papers, but he never wrote about the incident. My research, however, uncovered some associates of his, all of whom died that night. Except one: Douglas Henslowe. He\u2019s from Savannah, Georgia, and he\u2019s currently in the Joy Grove Asylum there.<br/><br/>"But it gets more interesting. In the same hospital is another patient who was also involved with this incident: Edgar Job. He\u2019s the only person to have been charged with anything related to this shootout, but that may only be because he confessed to killing a PI named Vincent Stack. A PI hired by Walter Winston. California found him mentally incompetent to stand trial, and after a stint in the state mental hospitals he got transferred to this place in Georgia. The reason I\u2019m glad the doctor is here is that Job was an assistant professor of physics at UCLA while he finished his doctorate."<br/><br/>"I wonder what he was working on," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"I don\u2019t know, but I was hoping you could tell me if there was anything odd about it. I\u2019ll be frank, even if it were convenient for me to go to Georgia right now, this investigation may require skills I don\u2019t possess."<br/><br/>"Do not worry," said Ruby. "I will bring everything I have available to this investigation. I\u2019m very glad you chose me to lead this expedition."<br/><br/>"So you smell a story here," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"I smell a very big story," said Janet. "And Jimmy--there\u2019s a very small chance that this may intersect with some of your more...unusual investigations."<br/><br/>"That\u2019s already started."<br/><br/>Janet looked at him with curiosity. "Anyway, do you need to book a train or something--"<br/><br/>"Don\u2019t worry," said Ruby. "I\u2019ll fly all of you there. Meet me at Grand Central Air Terminal in Glendale. Drink your coffee beforehand, we\u2019re leaving at 7 in the morning sharp."<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tom_of_Bedlam" title="Tom_of_Bedlam"><img alt="Tom_of_Bedlam" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/673/nVLLPAIN82FDO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tom_of_Bedlam">Tom_of_Bedlam</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443529/#Comment_443529" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-02T00:27:20+00:00" title="March  2, 2015 12:27AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great suggestion about importing the Solace and Symbol rules, and the other ones too.<br/><br/>Could you post the fixed stability cost table you made?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443537/#Comment_443537" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-02T04:31:29+00:00" title="March  2, 2015  4:31AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode I: The Girl From Yesterday (Part 5)</b><br/><br/>The <i>Ruby Dawn</i> was a Lockheed Electra--the same kind of plane Amelia Earhart was planning to fly around the world--painted bright red with a rather risqu\xe9 portrait of Ruby herself on the nose. On the flight out, Jimmy told Millicent that a friend of his at the FBI had confirmed that her friend Helen Taylor was at Joy Grove Asylum in Georgia.<br/><br/>The tarmac shimmered as they climbed down from the plane. The air was muggy, heavy, oppressive, full of dank and mossy scents. The heat hit them like a physical blow, knocking the wind from them and causing sweat to trickle unpleasantly down their backs almost immediately.<br/><br/>They set up camp in an old hotel near the center of town--the kind with faux colonial architecture, wrought iron balconies and quaint pictures of men and women in frock coats and hoop skirts hanging on the wall. Miserable little electric fans meekly tried to stir the air around them. They had about as much luck as a guy stirring tar with a chopstick.<br/><br/>After some discussion they decided to infiltrate Joy Grove in two separate parties; Jimmy and Dr. Orange would impersonate government officials of some kind, and Ruby, Geronimo, and Millicent would pose as a family looking for a place to send a relative.<br/><br/>Dr. Orange worked the phones for a few hours and several buckets of ice, arranging an introduction for Jimmy and him as federal investigators. Eventually he placed a call with Joy Grove to set up an appointment.<br/><br/>"This is Bethany Mae Hampton, Dr. Keaton's personal assistant. How may I help you?" She had a rich Georgia drawl, sweet as honey and just as sticky.<br/><br/>"I'm calling to arrange an inspection for the State Medical Board. My name is Dr. Orange, I've cleared it with all the relevant authorities." For once, Julius reflected, his German accent would actually be an advantage, given American stereotypes about psychiatrists.<br/><br/>"We haven't had a visit from anyone like you in a long time! Well, shall we say tomorrow at 10 o'clock? I'll let Dr. Keaton know."<br/><br/>"Excellent. I need to let you know our policy to bring along a layperson, so that we can make sure that your facility is accessible to all potential patients. It\u2019s a new thing but very helpful, I wouldn't know what an American would want in such a place."<br/><br/>"Are these people from Georgia?"<br/><br/>"It's a works program, you know Federal government."<br/><br/>"Oh, one of Mr. Roosevelt's ideas. Well, he's helping the country, I suppose. I'll let the security people know to expect you."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy and Dr. Orange took a black, not very new car up to Joy Grove to make them look even more like government officials. Bethany Mae Hampton met them in the reception area, a quiet place with old carpets and dented teak furniture. <br/><br/>"Our founder is really our administrator emeritus now," Bethany confided to them as she took them into the administration wing. "Dr. Keaton is responsible for day to day operations, and I assist him closely."<br/><br/>"Thank you," said Dr. Orange, who had done most of the talking; Jimmy was trying to preserve a strong, silent image, which Dr. Orange gave out as being a result of the WPA not always assigning the best candidates to him. "I just want to know," he said, "how you can take this heat?"<br/><br/>"Your blood thins out, I suppose. You're a European gentleman, aren't you? Are you Austrian?"<br/><br/>"I'm from near there."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dr. Keaton's office was festooned with diplomas, framed commendations, and the odd trout fishing trophy. From behind his desk, Keaton looked at Julius and Jimmy over his glasses. "Gentlemen, welcome, how can I help you? I assure you our certifications are up to date."<br/><br/>"I'm not saying there's any trouble, but I was sent to inspect you," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"We have many patients here at Joy Grove. But you'll find that our facilities are very modern."<br/><br/>"I'll first run down a checklist, and then my associate and I will want to speak with some of your patients."<br/><br/>"Yes, Bethany filled me in on all that. Is there any patient in particular you wish to see?"<br/><br/>"I looked at your patient records and found myself very interested in this Job fellow."<br/><br/>"Edgar Job? He is one of our most interesting patients. I hope to write a paper on him."<br/><br/>"I would very much look forward to reading something from such a distinguished physician," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/><i>[Flattery use by the good doctor.]</i><br/><br/>"Well," said Dr. Keaton, obviously pleased to have a new audience to regale, "Mr. Job's case cannot be considered in isolation. I think what I have is a most peculiar case of <i>folie \xe1 deux</i>. It seems he and Mr. Douglas Henslowe--also one of our patients--are locked into a pattern of mutually reinforcing psychosis."<br/><br/>"That's not so unusual, when patients meet in places like this..."<br/><br/>"Ah, but their entanglement precedes their mutual incarceration here! They were both involved in some violent incident out in California. Mr. Henslowe is a native of the area and came under my care by the good graces of his family. His grandmother, Virginia, is a real Southern belle of the old school. Marvelous woman. I quickly diagnosed poor Douglas as a paranoid schizophrenic. This incident in California is the focus of his psychosis--the details are quite shocking, I assure you doctor. Through my treatment of Douglas I came to realize that Mr. Job, the only other survivor of the incident, figured prominently in his delusions. I managed to convince the State of California to turn over Job to my care and have been treating them together ever since. Their interactions are quite intriguing! The things they believe together--astounding."<br/><br/>"Can you give me an idea?"<br/><br/>"I've been utilizing a brand new therapy of my own design. I call it 'confrontational therapy'. I force the two of them together in the hopes that it will help to crumble their delusions away. Unfortunately, when I do this without medicating them first, the results are rather unpredictable. One time they came nearly to blows. Mr. Job was extremely agitated, and shouted at Mr. Henslowe, 'You tried to kill me! But I\u2019m still here!'"<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443538/#Comment_443538" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-02T04:33:30+00:00" title="March  2, 2015  4:33AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode I: The Girl From Yesterday (Part 6)</b><br/><br/>Ruby, elegantly dressed and somehow managing to barely show any signs of being affected by the heat, marched into Joy Grove, trailed by a flustered Millicent and a darkly glaring Geronimo. Various flunkies tried to get her attention but she shrugged them off with a regal demeanor and long experience in expecting people to be invisible around her. Finally, Bethany Mae Hampton appeared and blocked their way.<br/><br/>"I'd like to see Dr. Keaton," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"The doctor is currently engaged speaking with two other gentlemen, but I am his personal assistant. How can I help you?"<br/><br/>"Well, then, you may help us. First, I would like some lovely iced tea."<br/><br/>"Joan, go fetch these fine, fine Yankees something cool to drink."<br/><br/>"I have," continued Ruby without acknowledging Miss Hampton's ire, "a bit of a kerfuffle."<br/><br/>"A ker-what?"<br/><br/>"A kerfuffle."<br/><br/>"Is that some sort of...pastry?"<br/><br/>"It's a problem," said Ruby with a sigh.<br/><br/>"Well, why didn't you say so, bless your heart!"<br/><br/>"It all started about a year ago. My father's mental health has begun to deteriorate. He has these, these, backflashes, where he remembers his time in the wars. On his worst days, he becomes quite childlike."<br/><br/>"I am sorry to hear that! I'm not sure if we can help you. Is he Georgian? Or from Virginia or South Carolina or other fine places like that."<br/><br/>"We're from Tennessee."<br/><br/>"Oh, I love Memphis."<br/><br/>"Memphis is lovely, but not at this time of year.  We haven't found a proper facility for him. They tend to want to put the other patients first."<br/><br/>"My dear Miss--it is Miss?--Fitzgibbons...of the Nashville Fitzgibbons?"<br/><br/>"No, the Marysville Fitzgibbons."<br/><br/>"We have a state of the art facility here, but you should know that our fees are somewhat high...I wouldn't want you to find yourself in an embarrassing..."<br/><br/>Ruby gently primped her hair, the gold bracelet with enormous blood-red rubies on her wrist flashing in the early morning sun.<br/><br/>"...however, I can show you around the facility," continued Bethany, mollified. "You understand some portions are off limits--we are still one of the busier ports in the South, and sometimes have to take in our share of violent foreign sailors who are dumped here when they grow too unruly. Drug addicts, or poor men driven mad by separation from their families."<br/><br/>"Excellent, my man will keep notes. However, my niece has a rather delicate disposition..."<br/><br/>"She can wait in one of the day rooms, we only allow nonviolent patients there. I don't suppose," Bethany whispered, "you're thinking of admitting her as well? We do offer a discount on multiple placements..."<br/><br/>"No, she's just a wallflower."<br/><br/>"Oh, I sympathize. I was a bit of a wallflower myself once, hard as it is to imagine today."<br/><br/><br/>"Then we tried two drops of Seconal," said Dr. Keaton as he led Jimmy and Dr. Orange down a hallway to the secure wing. "But that didn't work at all."<br/><br/>Jimmy stopped for a second. Strange occult marks had been written and carved into the walls.<br/><br/>"Mr. Job and Mr. Henslowe like to write those on the walls," said Dr. Keaton, noticing Jimmy's interest. <br/><br/>"It seems a bit creepy and odd."<br/><br/>"Well, this is a segregated area, so we don't need to worry about other patients finding them. Now, would you like to meet Mr. Job and Mr. Henslowe separately or together? If it's together, I'll need to fetch some orderlies."<br/><br/>"Of course we want to see them in the most interesting way," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"Fine. Just sit down in there and I'll be along presently."<br/><br/>Jimmy trailed slowly after them. He had recognized one of the symbols--a three lobed Eye, symbol of a particularly malicious god whose cult he had tangled with. He pushed the horrible memory of a huge, three-legged form with a vicious tentacle for a head out of his mind and followed Dr. Orange through a door.<br/><br/><i>[Cthulhu Mythos buy by JP; I charged 2 Stability for recognizing the sign.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>The room Jimmy and the doctor found themselves in was one of a million rooms like it. It breathed the institutional miasma of despair, helplessness, and disinfectant. They pulled up rickety chairs next to a scarred wooden table. Heavy U-shaped bolts had been bolted into the wood.<br/><br/>After a while two very large men in plain white scrubs came in, followed by a tall, spare man. He sat down at the table, ignored by the orderlies. "Henslowe," one of them grunted to Jimmy.<br/><br/>Doug Henslowe had a close-cropped, full beard, going to grey around his lower lip, and the leather skin and squint of a man who had spent long years outdoors. He crossed his arms and looked at Julius and Jimmy with an impassive face. If he was surprised to see them, he didn't let it register.<br/><br/>From the hallway came some shouts, and two orderlies propelled a tall, disheveled man into the room. His hair was wiry and curly, and he wore filthy gold-rimmed spectacles. He hadn't shaved for several days, nor, judging from the smell, bathed either. Heavy manacles were chained to a pair of leg irons around his ankles. One of the orderlies forced him into a chair and fastened the manacles to the U-shaped bolts.<br/><br/>"You're interrupting my work!" shouted Edgar Job. "Get your hands off me! I cannot be disturbed right now." He noticed Doug Henslowe sitting across from him. "Why am I here with this clown?" he demanded.<br/><br/>"What was so important?" asked Jimmy.<br/><br/>"I was in the middle of doing conic sections. It's what it's all about. Conic sections."<br/><br/>"Conic sections?" asked Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"I was mapping complex manifolds of spacetime. It's very difficult and I cannot tolerate any interruptions! I don't have time--time, that's funny--for this. Who are you, and why am I here with Henslowe again?"<br/><br/>"Tell me more about your work."<br/><br/>"My work? You couldn't understand my work. You're a psychiatrist. You don't even understand <i>people</i>. I have made advances that you people couldn't even <i>conceive</i> of."<br/><br/>"I studied with Dr. Born."<br/><br/>"Dr. Born? Dr. Born? That's supposed to impress me? What's he, an aerodynamicist now? Give me a break. Now, maybe if you had studied with a theoretical physicist, like Einstein, who kind of sort of has the glimmerings of what might be the very most outer reaches of my ideas. Or maybe that guy Orange. He had some good ideas once. Totally wrong about everything else. Complete moron too. The most boring, uninteresting papers I've ever read."<br/><br/>"And which ideas was he right about?"<br/><br/>Job sighed. "It's far too complex to explain to you. I see you brought your muscle," he said, jerking his head at Jimmy. "Is he supposed to intimidate me? Well I'm not afraid of you! I'm not afraid of any of you!"<br/><br/>Job pulled one hand up as far as his chains would allow him and pointed at his head. "The walls here don't hold me. They can't keep me prisoner. They're just one way of looking at things. But look at it another way, I'm free. "<br/><br/>Job slammed his hand back on the table. "I can't even show you my work. It's all back in my cell. They won't give me enough paper. They won't give me enough pens. I have to write things on the walls. Last year, they painted over six months work. Six months! And then just because I kicked an intern, they gave me three months in solitary. Chained up like an animal. But they couldn't chain my mind. In my mind I am free."<br/><br/>"Maybe we can get you some more paper," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Oh I see," said Job, leering at him. "You're supposed to be the good cop."<br/><br/>"I'm not a cop."<br/><br/>"You know what I mean." Job threw his head back, sighed, and started muttering to himself, worn out after such an extended period of agitation.<br/><br/>Dr. Keaton leaned in to whisper with Dr. Orange. "Fascinating, isn't it."<br/><br/>"It is. Do you think I could maybe see his room? We should leave Mr. Job here, he's a little agitated. James and the orderlies can watch over him."<br/><br/>"I'll be happy to take you down there."<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443539/#Comment_443539" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-02T04:35:24+00:00" title="March  2, 2015  4:35AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode I: The Girl From Yesterday (Part 7)</b><br/><br/>Millicent wandered through one of the day rooms. It was a pleasant enough place--the carpet was thick, to help muffle the screams from the other wards, and the furniture heavy, plush, and lacking any sharp corners. A few hard-eyed nurses kept watch over the patients in case one of them tried to filch a spoon.<br/><br/>Most of the patients were too far gone under, either from drugs or their own illnesses, to even recognize a spoon in any case. Millicent tried to talk with the ones who looked more alert, asking if any of them had seen a new female patient.<br/><br/>"New girl?" said one of the patients, a sad, shy man in scrubs. Medication or nerves gave him a little tic on the side of his face. "I saw them bring her in, sure. They took her to the closed ward, where they test the experimental medicines."<br/><br/>"Where's that?"<br/><br/>"It's in the east wing. East wing, yup, that's where they keep it. Boy, I miss baseball. You think you could get me Dizzy Dean's autograph?"<br/><br/>"If I see him, I will," said Millicent, getting up and sneaking over to a door on the east wall. She fell into her natural, stealthy rhythm, honed by countless walks with Uncle Jack and Vanessa. None of the orderlies looked up as she slid past their locker room. The nurse in the dispensary didn't see Millicent trailing silently behind her. Neither did the interns making rounds.<br/><br/>Eventually she reached a locked door, with "Authorized Personnel Only" painted on it. She pulled a small leather case out of her purse, and went to work on the lock. After a few minutes, she heard the latch click and she pushed the door open.<br/><br/>She passed a few operating theaters, and a room full of drugs and needles. At the far end of the wing she found a long line of cells. From many of them came a low moaning.<br/><br/>It wasn't a moaning of pain.<br/><br/>She opened the judas gate on a few of the cells. In some of them she saw groups of people committing the kinds of things that would have gotten Henry Miller not just banned for writing about, but lynched. Some cells had only one patient in them, but that man or woman was trying to join the party as best they could solo. In one cell she saw a woman screaming and pounding the wall violently, trying to rip the padding off the walls.<br/><br/>In the last cell she found her friend Helen.<br/><br/>She was wearing grey institutional pajamas and lying on a cot, a blissful expression on her face. Millicent had to call her name several times before she would respond.<br/><br/>"Oh, Millicent," drawled Helen. "How good to see you!"<br/><br/>"They said you had the flu. What are you doing here?"<br/><br/>"I was tired...they said I was crazy, I don't know why."<br/><br/>"What did they give you?"<br/><br/>"Oh, the most amazing stuff! I have some! Do you want some?"<br/><br/>She languidly held out a small vial in one hand. It was filled with a honey-colored substance. Millicent uncorked it and took a cautious sniff. It smelled strange, mossy, but with some inexpressible <i>other</i> scent to it, something exotic and enticing and tempting. She sealed the vial and slipped it in her purse.<br/><br/>"What did they give it to you for?" she asked.<br/><br/>"I don't know," said Helen. "But it makes me feel soooo good. I don't even remember what I felt like before I took it. You should take it. We should take it together!"<br/><br/>"Do the doctors give this to all the patients?"<br/><br/>"No. Not all the doctors. The woman doctor. The one who looks like a doctor. You should come in and we can take it and then we can have <i>fun</i>. Or take it back to school!"<br/><br/>Just then the door at the end of the wing slammed open. Millicent slid the observation port shut and slipped into a broom closet. Through the keyhole she saw an orderly sliding bowls of soup into the cells.<br/><br/>"Come on, you animals, here's your slop," he said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"You said you're from Marysville?" said Bethany to Ruby. "You must know Ida Perkins."<br/><br/>"No, I don't. My family is from there, but I was sent away to boarding school when I was young and--well, except for my father I don't get along well with them."<br/><br/>"Well, family is the most <i>important</i> thing. Why don't we go back to the day room and pick up your little--what is she, your niece?"<br/><br/>"The ward of a friend, actually."<br/><br/>"I didn't see a ring on your finger so I knew she couldn't be your daughter. Your friend doesn't talk much, do he? Silent Latin type, is he? I can see why you keep him around, bless your heart."<br/><br/>"He's a trusted advisor, and my bodyguard. He saved my life once."<br/><br/>"Did he," said Bethany, giving Geronimo the once over. "Well bless his heart."<br/><br/><br/> <br/>Jimmy leaned back in his seat and began to whistle a phrase of one of Walter Winston's film scores. Doug looked at him intently, and uncrossed his arms. "Where you learn that song?"<br/><br/>"I watched a lot of movies."<br/><br/>"Friend of mine wrote that song."<br/><br/>"You knew Walter Winston? Shame that he stopped writing music."<br/><br/>"Walter was a very good friend of mine. He was with me on the worst night of my life. The worst night of his life. So if his music died--well, a lot of things died that night. But I'm sure you've read the case file, <i>doctor.</i>"<br/><br/>"I'm not a doctor."<br/><br/>"No kidding. You're not a doctor or a fed, are you. Why are you here? You're not here to talk to Edgar Job, that murdering psychopath."<br/><br/>"I just want to find out what happened to Winston."<br/><br/>"Lots of people want to find out about that, but they never come to visit me. Who are you? What's your angle? Why should I trust you?"<br/><br/>"I've got no angle. I'm just trying to find out more about this for a friend. She believes something horrible happened."<br/><br/>"She? So somebody's here, looking around? Spying on me?"<br/><br/>"No, just me. I'm here on her behalf."<br/><br/>"So who is this <i>her</i>?"<br/><br/>"You can understand if I\u2019m hesitant to say."<br/><br/>"And you can understand why I ain't gonna tell you shit."<br/><br/>"Look, I really am an honest man. If anything is wrong, I will put it right."<br/><br/><i>[Reassurance spend by JP.]</i><br/><br/>"I tried to tell Walter a bunch of things," said Henslowe. "He never wrote back. But he should have been able to understand everything I sent him. Just in case he didn't, though, I wrote everything down when I left here in '32. Outside world and I didn't see eye to eye, so I came back here. I left my notes in the last place you'll ever find me. But you go on up to my house, and that will give you a start. And if you're working for who I think you are, those letters will explain things."<br/><br/>Doug crossed his arms again, his lips tightly sealed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"This is Edgar's room," said Dr. Keaton, unlocking a door. Julius peered inside, then stepped into the room, pushing Dr. Keaton aside.<br/><br/>Every inch of the walls were covered in mathematical formulae. Sheaves of paper with densely scribbled notes littered Job's small desk and cot. As he looked around, Dr. Orange realized that there were symbols he had never seen used in a formula before. They looked <i>Sanskrit</i>, as if Job had run out of Greek and Latin letters and had to switch to other languages to capture all his variables.<br/><br/>He tried to follow some of the threads of Job's thought. Some he recognized, Lorentz transformations and Riemannian equations describing the curvatures of space-time manifolds. But some made no sense, or followed no mathematical rules that he understood. <br/><br/><i>[Physics and Archaeology uses to recognize the characters &amp; follow the equations.]</i><br/><br/>"We photograph it every six weeks or so for our files," said Dr. Keaton. "It changes pretty rapidly. I can let you look at the photos, if you like."<br/><br/>"That would be very helpful," Julius whispered, eyes darting around the room.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443540/#Comment_443540" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-02T04:41:13+00:00" title="March  2, 2015  4:41AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2015 4:43AM by Aviatrix.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Great suggestion about importing the Solace and Symbol rules, and the other ones too.<br/><br/>Could you post the fixed stability cost table you made?</blockquote>\nThanks!

I had some ideas about decoupling Stability loss and Stability checks by having random Stability loss with no check and allowing PCs to buy down the cost by spending Interpersonal skills, but that's just a vague notion at this point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443584/#Comment_443584" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-03T04:14:05+00:00" title="March  3, 2015  4:14AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode I: The Girl From Yesterday (Part 8)</b><br/><br/>Millicent dashed through the empty halls of the East Wing, trying to get back to the day room. Suddenly something slammed into her from behind. She crashed to the floor, and felt hands lock around her wrists, pulling her around.<br/><br/><i>[MP was out of Sense Trouble, so with no points to spend the roll came up 1.]</i><br/><br/>A man in patient's scrubs was scrambling on top of her, panting and muttering. He grinned, and Millicent saw that his teeth were filed to points, and that he had cut his cheeks horizontally to make his mouth bigger.<br/><br/>She rolled to the side to break his grip and then threw a quick elbow to his face. The man howled in pain and fell back. She scrambled up to her feet. The man rolled over, panting, and <i>howled</i>, like a coyote on a dark and evil night. "I'm Renfield!" he shouted.<br/><br/><i>[Scuffling to get out of Fred\u2019s grip.]</i><br/><br/>Millicent, who had nightmares for weeks after reading the Stoker novel, screamed. She turned and ran down the hall. Patients banged against the bars of their doors as she fled past them, with the man barking and slobbering close behind.<br/><br/><i>[Fleeing Test to get away from him.]</i><br/><br/>She banged through a set of double doors and ran into a large man in an orderlies' uniform. He threw her up against a wall. Behind him, another orderly stepped forward and cracked her pursuer over the head with a sap.<br/><br/>"Fred, what have we told you about getting out of your cell?" he growled, and smashed Pointy Teeth again.<br/><br/>"Who the hell are you?" said his partner, pushing Millicent hard against the wall. "Visitors are not allowed in this ward."<br/><br/>"How do you know she's a civilian?" asked the other orderly, giving Fred a vicious kick. "She could be an inmate."<br/><br/>"Yeah, you're right. We'll just put you into a holding cell for a while. For your own protection."<br/><br/>"I'm here with Miss Fitzgibbons," said Millicent, desperately. "She has a lot of money."<br/><br/>"Sure, sure," said the orderly. "Well get that all straightened out. Now come on, girl. You've got nothing to fear. This is a place of healing."<br/><br/>They frogmarched Millicent to a padded cell and restrained her to the wall. <br/><br/><br/><br/>"I've talked to our interns," said Bethany to Ruby as they reached the reception room. "It seems your friend took ill and had a taxi fetch her back to the hotel."<br/><br/>"That's strange. We told her not to wander off like that."<br/><br/>"Yes, well, I must return to my duties."<br/><br/>"I'd like to call the hotel," said Geronimo. <br/><br/>"Yes, yes," said Bethany. "Go right ahead. Now I have a security matter to take care of..."<br/><br/>Ruby let Geronimo dialing the phone and walked out to her car. She lit up a cigarette, and paced back and forth. An orderly watched her through the front door, while another orderly stayed near Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Hurry up," he said to the bodyguard. "We only got that one line, Mex."<br/><br/>"I am <i>not</i> Mexican."<br/><br/>"Well <i>excuse</i> me. Anyway, get your hand off the phone, [racial slur]."<br/><br/>"I will give you back your phone when I have finished my duties for my employer."<br/><br/>The orderly pressed his big thumb down on the phone's cradle. "Guess you're done."<br/><br/>"If you don't remove your thumb, sir," said Geronimo with quiet menace, "you'll be lucky to be employed. But I understand cripples can also stay in this asylum."<br/><br/>The orderly's face flushed red. "You're lucky there's so many people around," he said, backing away. Then he turned and left the reception rooms.<br/><br/>Geronimo picked up the phone and began dialing again.<br/><br/><i>[1-point Intimidation spend; the orderly was a big tough guy.]</i><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443585/#Comment_443585" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-03T04:15:41+00:00" title="March  3, 2015  4:15AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode I: The Girl From Yesterday (Part 9)</b><br/><br/>"I can take you to the other facilities, but you\u2019ve really seen our most interesting cases," said Dr. Keaton, as he led Jimmy and Dr. Orange toward the entrance. A wall phone buzzed and he picked it up. "Yes, Bethany...I see...who got out? What are you talking about--no, no, I\u2019m sure you handled it. All right."<br/><br/>He hung up. "I\u2019m sorry gentlemen, I have one or two administrative matters that require my urgent attention. If you have any further questions, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll need you to make another appointment."<br/><br/>"Does this happen often?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"No, no, but we\u2019ve had some other visitors, a family looking to make a private committal. Just between us, that is a large portion of our operating income. Do give my best to the fellows up in Washington. Thank you, gentlemen."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ruby rifled through the sheaf of forms Bethany hand handed her and tossed a few pages into the back seat of the car. Putting on her most determined face, she stormed back into the reception room and confronted one of the orderlies. "Look, I understand you\u2019re busy, and everything is a bit unsettled. But I want to complete the paperwork you people gave me, and look? It\u2019s missing these pages."<br/><br/>"Look, lady, I don\u2019t know nuttin\u2019 about dat."<br/><br/>"Well, I can\u2019t legally complete this without it." Ruby smashed the papers into his chest. <br/><br/>"I\u2019ll go get someone," said the orderly. He turned away from Ruby, who slipped the keys she had lifted from him into her purse. She walked out of reception, unlocked the doors to the ward, and started to sneak down the hall, heels clacking on the hard floor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bethany Mae Hampton stepped into Millicent\u2019s cell. "Now, just what were you doing in the east wing?" she said.<br/><br/>"Can I talk to Miss Fitzgibbons?" asked Millicent.<br/><br/>"Why, no you cannot," said Bethany in a voice like curdled honey. <br/><br/>"I was sent by Helen Taylor\u2019s family to see how she\u2019s being treated."<br/><br/>"She\u2019s being treated most well. Maybe you\u2019d like to see how she\u2019s being treated? Sugar, how old are you?"<br/><br/>"Twenty. I\u2019m older than I look."<br/><br/>"Well, if you\u2019re twenty, I guess I can do whatever I want to you," said Bethany. She took out a hypodermic. "But since you say the Taylors are expecting to hear from you. "<br/><br/>"They\u2019re worried about their little girl."<br/><br/>"Their little girl is just fine. She\u2019s not the one we\u2019re looking for. And if you\u2019re twenty, neither are you. A little pentothal and some suggestion and you won\u2019t remember a thing about this."<br/><br/><i>[Intimidation spend by MP, which avoided her getting treated with the same drug as Helen--and possibly from being dumped in the swamp.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>Ruby skulked around a corner and stopped short. Through the open door to a cell directly ahead of her, she could see Millicent, trussed up like a turkey against the padded wall of the cell. <br/><br/>Ruby walked down to the nearest fire alarm and pulled the switch. Bells began ringing as Ruby ducked around the corner again. Bethany came storming out of the cell. "It never rains but it pours. Bruno, stay here and watch over our guest."<br/><br/>As soon as Bethany had left, Ruby tried to sneaky-pete up to the guard, but the clicking of her high heels alerted him.<br/><br/><i>[Amusingly, Ruby has no Stealth.]</i><br/><br/>"Hey lady," said the orderly. "You can\u2019t be back here."<br/><br/>"She\u2019s also working for the Taylors," called out Millicent from the cell.<br/><br/>"I don\u2019t care who she\u2019s working for! I\u2019ll throw her in there with you."<br/><br/>"You should know," said Ruby, "that I have spent some time on the island of Okinawa."<br/><br/>"What?" said the guard, his face as blank as snow on a mountain.<br/><br/>"I learned the arts...of <i>karate</i>." She smashed an open hand into the guard\u2019s throat.<br/><br/><i>[Ruby has...two, two I tell you! Points of Scuffling. Which RP spent, and rolled a 6. Then I had to break the bad news about what -2 damage means in Gumshoe.]</i><br/><br/>Coughing and sputtering, the guard doubled over. "I ain\u2019t gonna slug no dame," he choked out. "But lady, you gotta stop doing that!"<br/><br/>"I can turn your nervous system <i>off</i>," said Ruby. The guard stepped forward and raised his hands.<br/><br/>Ruby pulled a small automatic pistol out of her purse.<br/><br/><i>[Preparedness roll by RP to have her little Ladies\u2019 Gun.]</i><br/><br/>"Whoa, lady, there\u2019s no need to go to the gats. I ain\u2019t gonna do nuttin\u2019."<br/><br/>"Toss me your keys. Now, into that cell over there," said Ruby, gesturing to an empty cell. She slammed the door on the gorilla, then ran to Millicent and quickly released her bonds.<br/><br/>"We\u2019ve got to get out of here and lay low for a while," she said to the girl.<br/><br/>"I want to grab some files on the way out!"<br/><br/>The records room was next to the reception area. Ruby unlocked the doors to it with her stolen keys, and Millicent quickly opened several file cabinets and started pulling out files.<br/><br/>"How do you know where everything is?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"I work in the library at school."<br/><br/>The alarm stopped ringing.<br/><br/>"Let\u2019s go!" said Ruby. Grabbing Millicent\u2019s hand, she pulled the girl with her through the reception area. Geronimo saw them coming and threw the phone down, racing with the women for the car. As they pulled into the driveway, some orderlies tried to block their way. Ruby gunned the engine and shot past them, driving as fast as she could down the long tree-lined drive to the main road.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443586/#Comment_443586" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-03T04:17:11+00:00" title="March  3, 2015  4:17AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode I: The Girl From Yesterday (Part 10)</b><br/><br/>"I do have to apologize," said Bethany Mae Hampton to Jimmy and Dr. Orange.

"It\u2019s a real...kerfuffle. I think that lady was up to no good. I think she may have been some kind of <i>investigative reporter</i>," she said, emphasizing the last part in a voice that would have given Dillinger the heebies. "But I <i>will</i> get to the bottom of this, and I fully intend to call the Georgia Bureau of Investigation."<br/><br/><i>[Technically formed in March 1937, but I get at least one anachronism per session.]</i><br/><br/>"We need to talk about this right now!" said Dr. Orange. "We have some <i>serious questions</i> about what is going on." <br/><br/>Jimmy noticed that the doctor\u2019s German accent, erratic normally, seemed to suddenly become more pronounced. He took out a small notebook and began scribbling in it, while glaring at Bethany.<br/><br/><i>[JP and OP tag-teamed here--Jimmy\u2019s Intimidation use created the circumstances that would allow Dr. Orange to use Interrogate.]</i><br/><br/>"Yes, all right, please, right this way to my office," said Bethany nervously. "I wouldn\u2019t want anything to reflect negatively on Dr. Keaton, who is a brilliant man but perhaps not the most capable administrator."<br/><br/>Bethany\u2019s office was neat and uncluttered, with hardly anything to mark at as a personal office--no family pictures, or books, or even a copy of <i>Life</i> magazine.<br/><br/>"Now, gentlemen, I\u2019m sure we can all work this out, without any need to notify the authorities in Washington," said Bethany, sitting down behind her desk. Dr. Orange sat down in front of her, while Jimmy remained standing, trying to look menacing. "I think that Miss Fitzgibbons was some kind of agitator, maybe one of those Reds."<br/><br/>"Do you have anything worth investigating here?" asked Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"Not at all. People have all these misconceptions about places like this. Everything is absolutely above-board. If you have any questions, I\u2019m happy to answer them." <br/><br/>Her desk phone buzzed. Bethany picked it up and swiveled her chair around from Jimmy and Julius. She had a brief whispered conversation, and then swung quickly around and slammed the phone in the cradle. "Gentlemen, something has come up. I trust you can see yourselves out..."<br/><br/>Jimmy locked the door behind her as she left, and they began to search her office. In the bottom of a desk drawer they found a small doctor\u2019s bag, full of pills and vials of medicine.<br/><br/>"Wasn\u2019t she just a nurse?" said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>Jimmy rifled through the paperwork on the desk. He showed some of it to Dr. Orange, who had experience with bureaucratic organizations. They quickly came to the conclusion that Bethany was really making all the day-to-day decisions at Joy Grove.<br/><br/>"I\u2019m telling you, Jimmy, she could hide anything she wanted from Keaton."<br/><br/>"Just what is going on?" muttered Jimmy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Geronimo, realizing that their hotel was completely burned as a hideout, insisted that they drive straight to the airfield. Not long after, they were in the air, headed for Chattanooga--getting out the state being the better part of valor, in Ruby\u2019s opinion.<br/><br/>"How will Jimmy and Dr. Orange find us?" asked Millicent.<br/><br/>"That\u2019s why he\u2019s a private detective, dear," said Ruby.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443587/#Comment_443587" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-03T04:18:43+00:00" title="March  3, 2015  4:18AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode I: The Girl From Yesterday (Part 11)</b><br/><br/>Bethany was still hip deep in open files when Jimmy and Dr. Orange slipped out of her office and drove away. They stopped at a drugstore for lunch, and Jimmy flipped through a phone book, and then the city directory, until he found the address for Mrs. Virginia Henslowe.<br/><br/>"Looks like it\u2019s way out of town," he told Julius.<br/><br/>Dr. Orange looked at the map. "It looks like it\u2019s in the <i>swamp</i>."<br/><br/>By late afternoon they were motoring up a narrow dirt lane that became a causeway, crossing a marshy plain full of bogs and small ponds. A brackish, decaying smell surrounded them. Looking at the high water marks, Jimmy realized that when the tide was high enough the Henslowe estate must become an island.<br/><br/>They pulled through two rotted posts that looked like they may have once been painted white. Beyond them was a classic Georgian style house in a sad state of dilapidation. The grounds around it had long ago reverted to a half-wild clearing, with high grass and saplings of scrub pine growing randomly.<br/><br/>As they came closer, however, Jimmy and Dr. Orange noticed that some renovations were underway at the house--parts of it had been whitewashed recently, and new glass was in the lower floor windows. A scaffolding obscured part of the second floor.<br/><br/>A shambling old man with a giant hound of some kind came around a corner of the building and waved them to a stop. "Who a\u2019 hell air you, wha\u2019 you wan\u2019 comin\u2019 roun\u2019 heah, we ain\u2019t got no need of any-un. Lessin\u2019 you wi\u2019 the ressoration people."<br/><br/> "Yes," said Jimmy. "I\u2019m the architect. This is my assistant."<br/><br/>"Wha\u2019 evah. I thin\u2019 you-all desroyin\u2019 t\u2019 beauty o\u2019 the house, but come on."<br/><br/>They parked in front of the porch and got out of the car. The front door opened, and three young women stepped out. They were wearing antebellum dresses complete with hoop skirts, and their hair was elaborately styled in curls and ribbons.<br/><br/>Jimmy stopped dead. <i>Have I traveled in time</i>? he thought.<br/><br/>"I think Clark Gable would be dreamy as Rhett," said one of the girls as they walked by, haughtily ignoring Jimmy and the doctor.<br/><br/>"I think Henry Fonda would be better."<br/><br/>"Go on. Miss Mitchell said she wrote the part for him..."<br/><br/><i>Thank God</i>, thought Jimmy. <i>They\u2019re re-enactors.</i><br/><br/>He and the doctor climbed the short stairs to the porch and entered the house. A young woman in modern clothes met them in the entry hall. She had a small sorority pin on her lapel. <br/><br/>"Can I help you gentlemen? We\u2019re not really open for visitors, we\u2019re still finishing the second floor renovations."<br/><br/>"I\u2019m one of the architects," said Jimmy. "Some last-minute things to look at..."<br/><br/>"Regulations and such," said the doctor.<br/><br/>The woman brightened at the sound of the doctor\u2019s accent. "Oh, you must be here about the Viennese glass. That entire fan window there was all done in Viennese glass, some of it stained in the most beautiful colors. But of course a lot of it was shot out by some damn Yankee during the war."<br/><br/>"You bought this house?" asked Jimmy.<br/><br/>"No, Mrs. Henslowe is allowing us to restore it. She\u2019s lived in it her whole life, you know. Almost ninety years! She is just a <i>living treasure</i>."<br/><br/>"Where is she now?"<br/><br/>"Just upstairs. I can announce you."<br/><br/>She gave them a tour as she led them upstairs. The parlor had been completely restored, with authentic pre-war furniture and wallpaper. The second floor was in much worse shape, however, and drop cloths littered with construction materials were scattered around the area. It looked as if one of the bedrooms had collapsed into the first floor. <br/><br/>In a dingy but habitable sitting room they met Mrs. Henslowe, who sat in a rocking chair, her legs covered in a rug. A scrawny tabby cat sat on her lap and hissed at them as they came in.<br/><br/>Mrs. Henslowe looked as broken-down as the rest of the house, but with much worse prospects of renewal. Her rheumy eyes squinted under lank strands of grey hair, and her withered hands shook with tremors as she clutched her cat to her. Jimmy was no expert on fashion, but her dress looked at least forty years out of style.<br/><br/>"That is a lovely dress, and an angelic cat," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Tom here is my friend," said Mrs. Henslowe, patting the cat\u2019s head. "Are you here about the restoration? They\u2019re putting things back the way they were when my daddy built this place. It ain\u2019t never been the same since the war. But you all\u2019s is Yankees, aint\u2019cha? We never did hold much with Yankees down here, but it\u2019s all right I suppose. One of the architects is a Yankee and he seems to care about putting this place back. Did you know my daddy built this place?"<br/><br/>"I\u2019ve heard," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"Are you a German fella? I had a German beau back in \u201963. Came in on one of the blockade runners. He was a charming man, a count or a prince or something. Had a Heidelberg dueling scar. He was so handsome! He died though. One of Sherman\u2019s bummers put a bullet in his head. Them was terrible times."<br/><br/>"Horrible," said Jimmy. "We need to make sure this house is in tip-top shape--"<br/><br/>"You know my daddy built this place?"<br/><br/>"--so we want to look at your rooms, and some of the guest rooms, and your son\u2019s room..."<br/><br/>"Oh Doug? Dougie don\u2019t live here no more, he got a little sick so they sent him to the nervous hospital. He\u2019ll get better soon and then he can come and see the house all put back the way it was."<br/><br/>"Those hospitals help us with our loved ones," said Jimmy. "And I suppose you kept his room just as he left it?"<br/><br/>"Dougie hasn\u2019t been here since \u201932. He came back but he didn\u2019t like it outside the hospital anymore, so he went back. I tried to get him to stay here, but he wouldn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t hardly spend no time in his room, though. He was in the library all the time, writing to his friend. Must have been a bad man, because he never wrote Doug back once. \u2018Ceptin I got a big packet of Doug\u2019s letters back a few months ago. Seems his friend up and died and his estate returned them to me. Did you know my daddy built this house? Are you going to help fix it?"<br/><br/>"Yes ma\u2019am," said Dr. Orange. "We have to go do that now."<br/><br/>"All right. Well, the library\u2019s mostly restored, my daddy\u2019s books, and Dougie\u2019s books, and the family bible of course. Oh, and we got the record of all the slaves. The historical society is really interested in that."<br/><br/>"Thank you for all your help, ma\u2019am," said Jimmy. "We\u2019re going to go through all the rooms and take our measurements."<br/><br/>"All right," said Mrs. Henslowe. "Wait, you all\u2019s a Yankee. I don\u2019t want no damn Yankees in my house! You all better get gone!"<br/><br/>"Yes ma\u2019am," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"And you tell that General Sherman not to come around here!"<br/><br/>"We will, ma\u2019am. The South will rise again."<br/><br/>"Wilhelm? Is that you?"<br/><br/>Jimmy and Julius exchanged glances. "<i>Ja?</i>" said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>Mrs. Henslowe\u2019s head lowered to her chest and she began to snore.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443671/#Comment_443671" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-04T17:11:04+00:00" title="March  4, 2015  5:11PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode I: The Girl From Yesterday (Part 12)</b><br/><br/>Doug\u2019s room proved to have been stripped for the restoration. The library was more interesting, if you were planning to start an apocalyptic cult or three over a weekend--it was filled with crumbling codices and the kind of things Aleister Crowley kept around to impress girls.<br/><br/>One book showed signs of having been used often--<i>Communion Rites of Victorian Death Cults</i>. "Is this important?" says Dr. Orange, holding up the book.<br/><br/><i>[Evidence Collection use turned up the book.]</i><br/><br/>"That\u2019s the 1912 edition," said Jimmy. "It\u2019s a lot more common than the 1909 edition--that\u2019s worth a lot more. They really watered it down in the second edition, which is why the first is worth more."<br/><br/><i>[Occult use by JP to know about the separate editions.]</i><br/><br/>In a drawer they found a sheaf of Doug Henslowe\u2019s letters to Walter Winston. They were unusual to say the least--rambling discourses, quotes from the Bible, hand-drawn crossword puzzles and many other scraps of articles and drawings. Some of the letters have pin-pricks, or slight marks in the margins. To Dr. Orange, trained in cryptography during his days in the Reichsbanner, the letters were an obvious attempt at steganography. Well, bad encryption at any rate.<br/><br/><i>[Cryptography use by OP.]</i><br/><br/>It seemed clear that Winston had the same idea; scratch notes and circled words in the letters show an attempt to figure out coded messages. On one letter Dr. Orange found a frustrated message scribbled by Winston in German: "I know it\u2019s a book code, and I know the book. But it never works."<br/><br/>Jimmy looked at the copy of <i>Communion Rites of the Victorian Death Cults</i>. Winston, he knew, was pretty wealthy, and interested in the occult. And it hit him.<br/><br/>"It\u2019s this book," he said. "Winston knew Doug had it, but Winston only had the earlier, more expensive version. The pagination is completely different between them. That\u2019s why it didn\u2019t work."<br/><br/>Using Doug\u2019s own encryption text, they were soon able to decipher some of the hidden messages. Most of it was pretty mundane records of Edgar Job\u2019s daily activities. But on the last letter in the series, they found Doug\u2019s final message to Winston--two words in Latin:<br/><br/><i>CUSTUDIO CUSTODES</i><br/><br/>"\u2019I watch the watchers\u2019," muttered Dr. Orange. <br/><br/>"He went back to the hospital right after that letter," said Jimmy. "But who the hell was he watching? And who were <i>they</i> watching?"<br/><br/><br/><br/>Doug\u2019s journal, however, was not among his other papers. "Doug said it would be in the last place you\u2019d ever find him," said Jimmy. "Back where it all happened in L. A.? Or...heh. I guess the grave, right?"<br/><br/>"There\u2019s a cemetery out back," said Dr. Orange, looking through a window.<br/><br/>Moments later he and Jimmy dashed out the back door of the Henslowe mansion. The cemetery was a small family graveyard, overgrown with weeds and underbrush. Which is probably why nobody had noticed the large tombstone with DOUGLAS HENSLOWE written on it.<br/><br/>"Surprising," said Jimmy. "Doug\u2019s a bit dark." He looked up at the sky. "Getting near sundown."<br/><br/>"I think we need to pick up some supplies," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>They swung by their hotel, and then a hardware store to get picks and shovels and flashlights. Jimmy grabbed a map of Georgia so they could drive up to Chattanooga when they were done on the Henslowe grounds.<br/><br/>It began to rain, lightly at first and then hard enough to beat Noah. Large drops rain pelted their car as they cautiously drove up to the Henslowe place, headlights off. They slipped through the gate and saw Carruthers the groundskeeper dragging his enormous hound along with him, holding a burning torch in the other hand. <br/><br/>"Com\u2019 on less ge\u2019 in th\u2019 hut. Cool\u2019n off n\u2019 we cain warmup a lille," he said incomprehensibly.<br/><br/>Jimmy and Dr. Orange waited for him to disappear into his shack. They raced as fast as they could through the slippery, bottomless red mud to the cemetery and began digging--well, sluicing--in Doug\u2019s grave. After a few hours, they found a small tin box, sealed along the edges with wax.<br/><br/><i>[Me: I\u2019d tell you to knock off some Athletics, but it will just refresh the next day and there\u2019s no real danger here. (In game terms, you could call this a Simple Search.)]</i><br/><br/>Something rattled inside the tin, like a rock.<br/><br/>"Let\u2019s go," said Jimmy. <br/><br/>They made their way back to the car and were soon heading north. They drove for a while and then took a brief, damp rest off the side of the road. Two days later they pulled into a hotel in Chattanooga. Down in the saloon, they heard a familiar voice:<br/><br/>"There I was, a brute coming at me, on the movie set! <i>Eyes of flame</i>--"<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443672/#Comment_443672" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-04T17:11:57+00:00" title="March  4, 2015  5:11PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode I: The Girl From Yesterday (Part 13)</b><br/><br/>They compared notes:<br/><br/>Millicent has been dutifully going through the files she liberated from Joy Grove. The first thing she found out was that the money to pay for Edgar Job\u2019s treatment at Joy Grove had run out by 1933, and he was scheduled to be sent back to California. At the last minute, however, a private individual stepped in to provide the necessary funding: Douglas Henslowe.<br/><br/>She also found the full transcript of Doug and Edgar\u2019s unmedicated confrontation therapy session. For the most part it conformed with Dr. Keaton\u2019s recounting of the story, except that he left out an interesting detail: after Job started shouting at Henslowe--"You tried to kill me but I\u2019m still here!"--Henslowe very quietly said, "If I wanted you dead, Edgar, you\u2019d be dead already."<br/><br/>Douglas Henslowe readmitted himself in 1933. His first attempt to do so resulted in an examination by Dr. Keaton that concluded there was no need for further treatment. A few months later, he was re-examined, and this time proved to be a textbook case of paranoid schizophrenia. In fact, looking over his symptoms show that they somewhat suspiciously resemble the standard diagnostic checklist.<br/><br/>There were interesting fragments of notes from Dr. Keaton showing how he became intrigued by Edgar Job\u2019s case--snatches of things Doug said in therapy, mostly, like, "He killed Vince, how could a little nobody like that kill Vince Stack? Stack killed that bastard Echevarria, blew his head off with a shotgun."<br/><br/>The prescription schedules for both Job and Henslowe were all in Bethany Mae Hampton\u2019s handwriting. Some of the notations looked like it was Bethany who was making the actual diagnostic decisions, and just getting Dr. Keaton\u2019s initials. Geronimo, who had some medical training in Spain, confirmed that the medication decisions are in keeping with ordinary practice, but a nurse/administrator making those decisions was highly unusual.<br/><br/>Helen Taylor was committed by her family on the counsel of her faculty advisor, Patricia Evans, who also seeme to have made the recommendation to use Joy Grove. Millicent was slightly acquainted with Miss Evans, who was also the faculty advisor for the Epsilon Sigma sorority; they\u2019d asked her several times to pledge them.<br/><br/>Helen\u2019s diagnostic file contained a lot of notes on her age and physical condition, including approval to begin testing to see if she was a "potential". Whatever the strange drug they were giving Helen was not recorded in the file.<br/><br/>"It\u2019s something that makes all the people there want to...you know," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"No I don\u2019t," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Well, you must have done it..."<br/><br/>"Eat? Drink? Sleep?" said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"Go to a movie?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Relax?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Yes, they\u2019re very relaxed," said Millicent, blushing.<br/><br/>"Oh, it\u2019s probably a depressant then."<br/><br/>"Not that kind of relaxed. The...other kind of relaxed. Like a person who relaxes all your tension..."<br/><br/>"Oh, a masseuse. Or a muscle relaxant?"<br/><br/>"No, the thing the psychiatrists are always talking about."<br/><br/>"Father issues?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"The brain?" said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"Freud?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"But what is the father issue everyone has?" said Millicent, blushing even more.<br/><br/>"They hit them?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Daddy doesn\u2019t like what I do for a living?" said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"They\u2019re putting more than one person in a cell...to work out their...tension..."<br/><br/>"I think the young lady is referring to coitus," said Geronimo drily.<br/><br/>"They had her in a cell alone but she wanted me to come in there and be relaxed with her and then she gave me some to take back to school to relax other people which I really don\u2019t think would be a good idea," said Millicent breathlessly.<br/><br/>"She gave you some relaxing agent?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Yeah, so maybe we could take a look at it?"<br/><br/>"Oh, I think we should take a look at it, yes," said Ruby, sitting forward.<br/><br/>"No, ma\u2019am," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Her family doesn\u2019t know because they didn\u2019t want me reporting back to them, but twenty is too old for the person they are looking for."<br/><br/>"They\u2019re looking for someone?" said Jimmy sharply.<br/><br/>"Yeah, but they\u2019re also testing it on other people. She needs to get out of there."<br/><br/>"I\u2019ll make some calls," said Jimmy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A few days later Jimmy\u2019s friend from the Bureau called him back. "We talked to the Atlanta field office and had them pull Miss Hampton\u2019s records. Everything seemed to be in order, but you were gosh-darn so insistent, I ran her prints. That ain\u2019t her name."<br/><br/>"Color me surprised."<br/>\t.<br/>"The name we got for her is Anne Robinson. Graduated Princeton in \u201928 with a M. D. She started a psychiatric residency but never finished it. Then she just drops off the books for a while, until she\u2019s at Joy Grove as Bethany Mae Hampton. Seems she\u2019s from upstate New York originally. I put a call in to Joy Grove, but they said she quit a few days ago."<br/><br/>"I guess something must have happened at the asylum."<br/><br/>"Anyway, you owe me a steak."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ruby called up some of the society reporters who haunt her steps and put a few blind items out about corruption at a Savannah country-club type mental hospital.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443673/#Comment_443673" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-04T17:13:01+00:00" title="March  4, 2015  5:13PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode I: The Girl From Yesterday (Part 14)</b><br/><br/>They gathered together to open the box. The wax peeled and flaked off as Jimmy forced open the box. Inside he found a rock fragment with symbols carved in it, most prominently a three-lobed eye.<br/><br/>Jimmy gulped.<br/><br/>"Oh, I know that symbol, it\u2019s from the Axum Empire in ancient Ethiopia. It blocks spying spells and mystical surveillance. My psychic uses it as her doormat pattern," said Ruby.<br/><br/><i>[1-pt Occult Spend by RP.]</i><br/><br/>Beneath the stone was a note from Doug to Walter Winston:\n<blockquote>I have destroyed the notes I took of our investigation, after compiling what I saw and remembered into this notebook. The stone you may recognize from the barn that night; I think it was E\u2019s. I know the Thing watches me. I think it could hurt me if it wanted to. I put our materials in a safety deposit box in the First Bank of Long Beach. The key is here. Use it wisely. I know you will.<br/><br/>Don\u2019t come for me. I don\u2019t think I have it in anymore me to do the work. I don\u2019t trust myself anymore, except to watch.<br/><br/>Custudio Custodes<br/><br/>Doug</blockquote>\nAnd beneath that they found a notebook wrapped in plastic. A small safety-deposit key was tucked inside the cover.<br/><br/>Jimmy flipped open some pages. He immediately found a horrific, lurid image of toothed tentacles tearing bodies to pieces. He slammed the book shut and put it back in the box.<br/><br/>"Nobody read that book right now," he said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Later that night, however, Millicent snuck the box into her hotel bed and read the book beneath the covers. The bizarre, at times incoherent notes--since Doug assumed Walter would read it, he left things out or made shorthanded references to events--slowly painted a picture.<br/><br/>Winston and his friends were investigating an apocalyptic cult in Los Angeles led by a man named Ramon Echevarria, a local if relatively anonymous big-shot. In late 1925 they became convinced that Echevarria was going to start a ritual that had a chance to destroy the world. They decided to put an end to the cult. Millicent noted that Doug gradually became as convinced as Winston and Dr. Kullman that the threat was real.<br/><br/>Winston and his circle attacked the cult; Vince Stack killed Echevarria, but then something terrible happened. "The Thing came out of the barn," Doug wrote. "The Thing with the Mouths, the Thing that devours. And it killed so many people. It killed Kathy, it killed the doc, and I ran and I ran and I ran. And days later I found you, Walt. But since then I can\u2019t sleep."<br/><br/>The book ended with a postscript from Doug: "I couldn\u2019t take it anymore, so I went for a rest. Now I\u2019ve found out they\u2019re moving Edgar Job here permanently, and I knew I had to watch him. So I\u2019m going back into the asylum. Because I know that he\u2019s important, and I know they\u2019re still looking for him. ALWAYS KEEP THIS ROCK NEAR THE BOOK."<br/><br/>Millicent discovered that she couldn\u2019t sleep either. It sounded like Doug\u2019s paranoid ideation, but...there\u2019s a compelling power to his illustrations, and she couldn\u2019t shake the images. And...the idea that so many intelligent people could become convinced that there was a real threat from a <i>ritual</i>, that somehow <i>magic</i> was involved and could work...<br/><br/>She shuddered with sudden pain and terror, feeling completely alone.<br/><br/><i>[+1 Cthulhu Mythos for reading the book.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>By the time her call to Vanessa Brady went through it was after midnight in Venice, California. "You know you shouldn\u2019t call me," said Vanessa over the crackling long-distance lines.<br/><br/>"I found Helen. They were doing things to her that they shouldn\u2019t. But then they said she wasn\u2019t the one they were looking for, and asked me my age. I lied and said I was twenty, and they said I was too old. So I\u2019m thinking maybe I needed to call."<br/><br/>"Is Jimmy there with you? Good. Listen to me very, very carefully. If anything goes wrong, you go to Jimmy. You don\u2019t tell him anything, but you go to him."<br/><br/>"Are you okay?"<br/><br/>"I\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll talk to Freddie, I\u2019ll talk to Bradley.

Ruby and Geronimo returned her split-level in Beverly hills. Dead leaves drifted listlessly on the surface of the swimming pool. Smog the color of cigarette smoke oppressed the entire neighborhood.<br/><br/>Dr. Orange went back to Caltech. His friend Max Born seemed more harassed than usual, although of course neither of them could talk about the projects they were working on. Julius buried himself in some cloud traces made by the grad students of his irregularly-taught seminar, to catch himself back up on his theoretical works. He got his monthly letters from Dr. Goddard--enthusiastic--and Dr. von Braun--guarded.<br/><br/>Geronimo reviewed the reports of the staff--Luz the maid, Francine the cook, William the butler. All seemed in order, but something bothered him. Long experience working against the Fascists in Spain had taught him to trust those feelings.<br/><br/>A few nights later he knocked on Ruby\u2019s door. Miss Fitzgibbons was wearing a barely-there froth of lace and satin. On the bed behind her a tanned man who probably had a side business posing for Michelangelo covered himself hastily in a sheet.<br/><br/>"Do you have a moment to talk? I have something very important to tell you," said Geronimo, unperturbed.<br/><br/>"Only a moment," said Ruby grouchily.<br/><br/>"<i>Tr\xe8s vite, ma petite chou</i>," said the man as Ruby closed the door.<br/><br/>"I don\u2019t even know what he says," sighed Ruby. "But isn\u2019t Andr\xe9 gorgeous?"<br/><br/>"I have observed the same car parked outside the house on multiple occasions, as well as suspicious passers-by. I believe the house is being watched, and not by paparazzi. This is professional, a mob most likely."<br/><br/>"We have that cabin up by Lake Arrowhead," said Ruby. "We can head up there."<br/><br/>"We\u2019ll have the groundskeeper drive away from the house, and then cut through the backyard to meet him a few blocks away. That should throw them off our trail."<br/><br/>"Let me just take a moment to pack my things."<br/><br/>"We have to leave quickly, and without your usual accoutrements. Don\u2019t tell anyone where we are going."<br/><br/>"Well, I\u2019ll let Jimmy know we\u2019re leaving on <i>knife related reasons</i>."<br/><br/>Geronimo shook his head sadly and went to make arrangements.<br/><br/>Despite Ruby\u2019s rather expansive definition of <i>traveling light</i> (two suitcases, a hatbox, and her large makeup bag), their escape went off without a hitch. However, on the long drive up, Geronimo couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that they were being followed. He could never catch their tail, but he was pretty sure one was there. Whoever it was, they were very, very good.<br/><br/><i>[Piggybacking stealthless Ruby caused GP\u2019s Stealth roll to fail, and then a Sense Trouble roll vs. the Stealth modifier of their tail also failed.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>On a brilliant sunny day--the first in a week--Janet Rogers came by Jimmy\u2019s office. She found Millicent sitting with Jimmy, doing some homework. Stacks of papers, some with official Los Angeles city seals on them, were piled on Jimmy\u2019s desk.<br/><br/>"Hello Millicent," said Janet. "Well, Jimmy, did you find out anything?"<br/><br/>"Quite a bit. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the kind of story you want to be publishing."<br/><br/>"Was this Winston fellow up to something? Did you meet Henslowe? Did you meet Job?"<br/><br/>"I met them. Have you ever met Henslowe before?"<br/><br/>"Yes," said Janet after a pause. "Once or twice."<br/><br/>"He wanted to know who was asking about him."<br/><br/>"That stands to reason..."<br/><br/>"But I said I was working for a <i>her</i>, and he came to a conclusion about who that was right away. I have this feeling that he thought it was <i>you</i>. Did you contact him about the story?"<br/><br/>"No. I haven\u2019t had any contact with Henslowe in years." <br/><br/>"Come on, Janet."<br/><br/>"No! I didn\u2019t call him about this story. I told you I wanted this all under the table, but now it looks like you\u2019ve involved me."<br/><br/>Jimmy could tell that Janet was evading him about how she knew Doug Henslowe. He reflected for a moment that she hadn\u2019t resumed her maiden name, Edelmann, after divorcing her husband.<br/><br/>"If this comes up again, you have to let me know," he said. "This could be dangerous. Very dangerous."<br/><br/>"You think there was more to it? Was Winston up to something important?"<br/><br/>"The problem is that most of what we know came from the crazy book Doug wrote," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"What crazy book?" said Janet.<br/><br/>"His journal."<br/><br/>"If Doug is crazy, maybe there\u2019s nothing to this..."<br/><br/>"He\u2019s not as crazy as people think," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"It\u2019s crazy in my sidework investigation way," said Jimmy. "Have you heard of a guy named Ramon Echevarria?" He pronounced it the Spanish way, rolling the <i>r\u2019s</i> and stressing the <i>i</i>.<br/><br/>"That was one of the people who died in that thing in the Valley," said Janet. "Along with all of Walter\u2019s friends, except Doug. Was Walter there?"<br/><br/>"Doug\u2019s book said he was," said Millicent. "He thought Echevarr'a was doing some ritual--"<br/><br/>"Careful, now," said Jimmy. <br/><br/>"Didn\u2019t I hire you to tell me what you know?" demanded Janet.<br/><br/>"I will. Gently. Not all at once. I worry," said Jimmy. "We\u2019re going to look into this Echevarria and his group."<br/><br/>"His <i>group</i>?" Janet was taken back. "I have to go think about this. I want you to keep looking into this...I haven\u2019t decided what to write about, yet, if I write about anything. But keep looking." <br/><br/>Jimmy thought he felt her trembling ever so slightly as he helped her into her coat. But that was the only sign anything had gotten to her.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443860/#Comment_443860" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-09T15:44:44+00:00" title="March  9, 2015  3:44PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2015 3:45PM by Aviatrix.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode I: The Girl From Yesterday (Part 16)</b><br/><br/>"Vince Stack. Dr. Kullman. Katherine Clark," J. J., one of Jimmy\u2019s top operatives said, slapping some photographs down on Jimmy\u2019s desk a few days after the meeting with Janet. "Boss, you picked a winner here. This guy Stack. Well-known New York PI, came out to L. A., paid his respects to the local cops. Might have been private, but not so much an investigator. More a lead pipe to the head, shotgun in the face kind of guy."<br/><br/>"So like the O\u2019Donnell part of our company."<br/><br/>"I don\u2019t wanna say nothing against Mr. Frank. Cause he\u2019d kill me. Stack\u2019s probably the one who did Echevarria, he was found near a trench-cleaner from the war. Stack was known to use a gun like that from his time overseas."<br/><br/>Jimmy grunted and picked up Katherine Clark\u2019s picture.<br/><br/>"Clark was a photographer, went to Columbia--that\u2019s how she knew Winston, he taught there," continued J. J. "Boss, that one is not so good.  She was found with her head removed. Official report is that she was found torn apart by animals. D. A.\u2019s office is giving me the bum\u2019s rush on this, nobody there wants to say nothing about it."<br/><br/>"Cold shoulder?"<br/><br/>"Ice cold, boss. This guy Kullman? Taught psychology at Columbia, that\u2019s how he knew Winston. They were good friends. They were supposed to be working on stuff together, an opera or something. Kullman had a major interest in the occult and parapsychology. Anyway, he was found near his wheelchair--he was in a chair most of his life--looks like he was trying to crawl back into the car when he died. Again, attacked by \u2018wild animals\u2019. Stack, though, he was found stabbed, some skel named Edgar Job took the rap on that. Weird case. The sheriff\u2019s pulled up to the place, way out in the valley--it\u2019s all Okies now. Found the barn on fire, bunch of dead bodies. Most were never really identified. Couple of days later, Job comes wandering onto some farm, says he killed a guy and wants to be arrested. State found him too nuts for prison, put him in an asylum. Sheriff\u2019s boys think there were other survivors, they found bloody footprints in the area." <br/><br/>"Got anything else on Echevarr\xeda?"<br/><br/>"Not really. Police file assumes he must have been some kind of preacher. Owned a house, some other family lives there now, nothing linking them back. I found one lead--he was buddies with a guy named George Ayers, an egghead from UCLA. But that guy\u2019s been missing since 1926. If it makes you feel better, that\u2019s on a account he went to Ethiopia before all this happened out in the valley and never came back. Officially he\u2019s \u2018missing\u2019. And that\u2019s all we got." <br/><br/><br/><br/>Millicent spent her last few days in Los Angeles haunting various libraries, hunting up details on Echevarria. He had been a Mexican national, a real-estate mogul with a lot of famous friends but one who somehow had managed to keep himself out of public view. She was able to fix a date for when he died: the night of January 13-14, 1926. The same night as the L. A. blackout, caused by lightening striking a power distribution substation in the Valley.<br/><br/>Coincidentally, it was near the farm that Echevarria died on.<br/><br/>Walter Winston was much better represented. He had been fairly well-known for his highbrow and avant-garde music--a concerto for orchestra, a chamber opera, a few eclectic string quartets--but had made his money writing film scores during the silent era, as well as a few popular songs that he ghosted for singers who wanted to look more musical than they were.<br/><br/>Before immigrating to America, he had studied at a conservatory in Geneva, Switzerland. During this time he had been a fairly ordinary Late Romantic composer--something like an early Arnold Sch\xf6nberg. Right before he left Geneva, however, his musical changed radically, exploring new and unusual harmonies. Many reviewers and musicologists had praised the haunting, disturbing sound his music attained during this period.<br/><br/>At his death he had still not finished the cello concerto he had been working on for almost thirty years; little about it was known, but someone who had seen the title page claimed that it was dedicated to an "Erich Z."<br/><br/><i>[I didn\u2019t make this explicit in session, but yes, this was a reference to Lovecraft\u2019s "The Music of Erich Zann."]</i><br/><br/>He had been a widower when he died, having married a woman named Karen Edelmann when he first came to America. He was survived by their only child, a daughter named Janet. Reading between the lines, Millicent concluded that Winston and his daughter weren\u2019t close.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443861/#Comment_443861" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-09T15:46:00+00:00" title="March  9, 2015  3:46PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode I: The Girl From Yesterday (Part 17)</b><br/><br/>Dr. Orange decided to look into the sample of the drug Millicent found in Joy Grove. His chemistry was a bit rusty, but certainly good enough, he thought, to get some specific gravities and maybe some stains for different chemicals. He grabbed a workstation at the end of the day from a chemist heading home.<br/><br/>"Here to do some <i>real</i> science, eh Doc?" he said good-naturedly to Julius. "Have a good night."<br/><br/>The results were fascinating. There was something <i>chaotic</i> about them--the same tests could produce different results even under identical conditions--but at the same time they pointed to some larger <i>pattern</i>, something he could vaguely discern the outlines of even if the details seemed impossibly complex. The drug itself seemed to have more characteristics than he could have expected; each test revealed some further nuance he needed to explore, and each exploration revealed more avenues of investigation.<br/><br/>He was headed to the x-ray crystallography lab when he noticed some of the chemists arriving for work. He frowned for a moment; it seemed only a few minutes ago that he had looked up at the clock and saw it was midnight. Then he shrugged. It didn\u2019t matter! This chemical might give him insight into the building blocks of <i>life itself</i>!<br/><br/><i>[I made this a Hard Driver against the doc\u2019s Thirst for Knowledge drive. The properties of the drug make that drive particularly susceptible...]</i><br/><br/>When he came back to his station, Clyde, the chemist, stared at him. "Um, doc? You okay? You haven\u2019t changed. Or shaved."<br/><br/>"It\u2019s fine, fine. It\u2019s a new look. I still need this station. Go use Henry\u2019s, he\u2019s at a grant thing at UCLA."<br/><br/>The atomic structure of the molecule was impossible, but yet he had the plates showing it in his hands. Incredible! Amazing! He could tell that he was on the verge of perhaps the most <i>exciting scientific breakthrough of the century!</i> Maybe <i>any</i> century! This would make splitting the atom look like discovering fire!<br/><br/>The next thing he knew, Clyde was shaking his arm. "Doc? You all right? You\u2019ve been there for four hours. When was the last time you ate?"<br/><br/>"This morning. I\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine."<br/><br/><i>[TN 4 Health Test for the doc to stay conscious here--he hasn\u2019t eaten in 24 hours at this point, or slept. I was also draining away Stability; by this point he had lost 2 points of Stability studying the drug.]</i><br/><br/>Rayon? Nylon? Nothing compared to this! When he was done studying this substance, Dr. Orange would be able to spin <i>silk out of air</i>, and make...transparent aluminum! Why not! This was the chemical breakthrough of an age!<br/><br/>Clyde shook him by the shoulder again. "Doc? It\u2019s closing time...I\u2019m going to need my station back tomorrow, Henry will be in then. Uh...you do know you\u2019ve used about half our monthly budget of chemical tests, right? I\u2019m going to need to bill the Applied Division..."<br/><br/>"Fine, fine. Tomorrow."<br/><br/>He was halfway through another series of <i>fascinating</i> pH tests when Dr. Born arrived, greeting him in German. "Julius, are you all right?"<br/><br/>"Fine. Who? What?"<br/><br/>"Dr. Ruthven told me you\u2019d been here since last night...you look terrible."<br/><br/>"That\u2019s not very nice! Leave me alone."<br/><br/>"You look like you did when we were sneaking out into Holland. I know what you look like when you haven\u2019t eaten for a couple of days!"<br/><br/>"I ate an hour ago."<br/><br/>"Julius, what time is it? Don\u2019t look at the clock, just tell me what you think the time is."<br/><br/>"Uh...late, but not late late? Early late?"<br/><br/>"Why don\u2019t we have a drink," said Dr. Born. "Just come over and we\u2019ll have a drink, and then you can go back to work. Just a quick snifter of brandy."<br/><br/>"Fine," said Dr. Orange. He took a last longing look at the chemistry station and went to Dr. Born\u2019s office, where he gulped down a small glass of cognac...<br/><br/>He woke up in his apartment the next morning, done in by exhaustion more than the drink. Dr. Born brought him a cup of coffee.<br/><br/>"Julius," he said, "I\u2019m very worried about you. You worked yourself to the edge of exhaustion. I looked at your notes and they don\u2019t make any sense. The first fifty or sixty pages I could mostly follow...but the next hundred pages are complete nonsense. After that your notes just trail off into an odd scrawl with dots on the page. And what looks like Sanskrit. Whatever you were looking at, I\u2019m not sure you should continue this line of research."<br/><br/>"But why! Why should I stop! It\u2019s amazing!"<br/><br/>"I\u2019ll admit I am curious to find out what you were doing. It\u2019s not completely...alien...to some of my own researches. I think you should take the rest of the day off. Is there anyone you\u2019d like to talk to? I can take the rest of the day off myself. We\u2019re doing the static testing for the...I can\u2019t really talk about it."<br/><br/>"Don\u2019t worry, everything\u2019s fine. I can\u2019t wait to get back to work."<br/><br/>"Julius, I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea."<br/><br/>"But why? Isn\u2019t this what we\u2019re here for?"<br/><br/>"Well, that\u2019s true...perhaps we should investigate it together. That way we can keep ourselves on track.

"Mr. Wright? This is a courtesy call from the Pasadena PD. We got a couple of mad scientist types down here in the drunk tank. Apparently they had to be evicted from the Caltech lab. They were there all night, looks like they broke into a supply closet and tripped an alarm. When we got there they looked kind of out of it, so we threw \u2018em in the tank until we could figure out what to do. One of them had your card, so we gave your office a ring."<br/><br/>"Is one of them named Julius?"<br/><br/>"Yeah, Julius Orange."<br/><br/>"I\u2019ll be right there."<br/><br/>Betty picked him up at his apartment building. "So when are you going to give me that job, Mr. J?" she asked as they rushed towards Pasadena.<br/><br/>"You study those books I sent you?"<br/><br/>"Yup! Well, I mean the new Black Mask magazine came out, so I\u2019m a bit behind..."<br/><br/>As soon as he got to the police station, some cops led him to the holding cells. They were nervous for cops. It struck Jimmy as strange and even a bit obscene, like a naked judge. Julius and Max were pacing back and forth, gesticulating and speaking to each other in rapid-fire bursts:<br/><br/>"So the chemical structure--"<br/><br/>"Yes, yes! On an atomic level--"<br/><br/>"The ringstrassenuntergegangenheit..."<br/><br/>"Julius!" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Not now!"<br/><br/>"Wait, was that you?" asked Dr. Born.<br/><br/>"I thought it was you!"<br/><br/>"I think that man was talking to you."<br/><br/>"Julius," said Jimmy, "you\u2019re in jail."<br/><br/>"Aren\u2019t we all in jail? It doesn\u2019t matter!" said Dr. Orange. <br/><br/>"Why did you break into a chemical lab?"<br/><br/>"We didn\u2019t have the keys, so we used a fire axe," said Julius. "It\u2019s all right, we wrote down everything we took."<br/><br/>"Wait, did you write it down?" said Max.<br/><br/>"I thought you did!"<br/><br/>"It doesn\u2019t matter! When we make our first <i>billion</i> off the chemical, we\u2019ll pay it back. We\u2019ll pay them all back!"<br/><br/>"I\u2019ll take care of them," said Jimmy to the police. With visible relief, the cops helped herd the two Germans down Jimmy\u2019s car.<br/><br/>"Are we going back to the lab?" asked Max.<br/><br/>"We must! We were so close to the breakthrough!" said Julius.<br/><br/>"I have come to a realization, Julius. This chemical, it must be <i>alive</i>. Call me crazy--"<br/><br/>"You\u2019re crazy!"<br/><br/>"Thank you! I think it\u2019s intelligent! A new form of chemical intelligence."<br/><br/>"Take us up to Ruby\u2019s cabin," said Jimmy to Betty. He opened the door and pushed Dr. Born into the back seat. Max slid over, opened the opposite door, and jumped outside. He started to run in the direction of Caltech.<br/><br/>Jimmy slid over the hood of the car and pounced on Born. "Run, Julius, run!" shouted the scientist. "Finish our work!"<br/><br/>Jimmy broke out a set of handcuffs and cuffed Born and Orange together. During the ride up to Arrowhead they both struggled against their restraints in a more and more agitated fashion.<br/><br/>"I could get back to work! If I only didn\u2019t have this useless hand!" shouted Julius, straining his wrist against the handcuff.<br/><br/>"Conic sections! Conic sections!" cried Born.<br/><br/>Fortunately, they both passed out from exhaustion long before they reached Ruby\u2019s cabin. Geronimo helped Jimmy carry the Germans into the house when they got there. Ruby provided some restraints to tie the scientists to their beds, in case they became agitated again. (Jimmy looked askance at Geronimo, who merely rolled his eyes.)<br/><br/>Geronimo told him that he was worried he and Ruby had been followed up to Lake Arrowhead, so Jimmy grabbed a flashlight and took a turn around the cabin grounds. What he found disturbed him--broken branches here and there, cigarette butts no more than a day or so old, a greasy sandwich wrapper. All the sorry detritus of long hours spent watching and waiting.<br/><br/>There were a number of locations in the woods, he noticed, where somebody would have an absolute peach of a shot at the cabin. And anyone inside it. <br/><br/><br/><br/>And let\u2019s leave them all there. I like to think of Jimmy like that--deep in thought, silhouetted against the pink sky of early dawn, that familiar worry already crawling down his stomach. What were you thinking, Jimmy? Was it, <i>it can\u2019t be</i>, or <i>not again</i>? <br/><br/>And inside the house, poor raving Doc Orange, brain reeling with revelation and trying to swim against an impossible tide, not willing to concede the fight, like a man who will drown because he won\u2019t take off his shoes. <br/><br/>Look at Geronimo, still tough, used to being hunted but weary of it all, having to deal with Ruby and a couple of mad scientists and worrying just a bit at how much this was going to take out of him. <br/><br/>And of course darling Ruby, blissfully asleep, afloat on dreams of pleasure and sailing unaffected above all the troubles.<br/><br/>She had no idea what was coming.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443983/#Comment_443983" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-12T18:30:58+00:00" title="March 12, 2015  6:30PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode II: Prisoners of Our Own Device (Part 1)</b><br/><br/>Sunlight streamed into Ruby\u2019s cabin, clean mountain sunlight unfiltered by the fog and filth of Los Angeles. Jimmy closed the curtains. He didn\u2019t want anyone shooting in. And the work they were doing was anything but clean. Nothing that you wanted out in the sunlight.<br/><br/>In a guest bedroom, Dr. Orange woke up. His arms were tied to the bedposts, leaving him trussed in an uncomfortable position that reminded him of his interrogation training classes. He began to shout.<br/><br/>"What am I doing here?" he demanded when Jimmy came into the bedroom. "Why am I here? How come I\u2019m tied the bed? Why are these restraints so seductively comfortable? Where\u2019s Max? Is he working on it? Let me go!"<br/><br/>"Relax," said Jimmy. "You need your rest."<br/><br/>A disheveled Ruby, in her peignoir, stepped into the room. She threw a glass of water in Julius\u2019 face. "You will calm down. You will not wake up anyone else. You will get back to your work later."<br/><br/>"I\u2019m wet," sputtered Julius, "and restrained, and I can\u2019t do my work."<br/><br/>"Julius," said Ruby. "Look at my necklace." She dangled her ruby necklace in the early morning light. It sparkled with the seduction of wealth. "Good\u2026good\u2026calm down."<br/><br/><i>[Hypnosis! Use by Ruby. She then tried to implant a post-hypnotic suggestion.]</i><br/><br/>Dr. Orange began to breathe easier. Ruby poked through his things and pulled out one of his fountain pens. "Julius," she whispered in his ear, "I need you to forget all about what you were working on. Whenever you feel like you need to return to it, I want you to clutch this pen. All right? Just put it all out of your mind."<br/><br/>Slowly she brought him out of the trance. "What happened?" said Julius. "Why am I here? What have I been doing? I was working on something\u2026something Max brought me. I got sucked into it, I guess."<br/><br/><i>[Oops!

I\u2019ve been saying cabin, but <i>ranch house</i> would be closer, complete with the usual dude accoutrements\u2014a saddle with no horse to ride on, brands burned into the ceiling beams that no cattle had ever worn, rawhide thongs that nobody had ever figured out a use for.<br/><br/>Two men in black suits, the sour odor of government service practically visible on them, stepped out, accompanied by a pair of MPs in Sam Brownes and puttees. Bringing up the rear was the local constable, a paunchy old-timer wearing a Stetson and a hogleg Colt pistol. He looked old enough to owe Wyatt Earp some money, and tough enough to spit in his eye when he paid it.<br/><br/>"Secret service," flashed one of the Feds when Geronimo answered the door. "We\u2019re looking for Doctors Born and Orange."<br/><br/>"<i>\xbfQuien?</i>"<br/><br/>"I don\u2019t speak Mex."<br/><br/>"Do you have a warrant? This is a private house."<br/><br/>"Listen, [racial slur], I don\u2019t need a warrant to get the docs. But we do have a warrant. A warrant for the arrest of James Wright. The constable here is going to serve it."<br/><br/>Ruby emerged, immaculately dressed in the latest sportswear. She was noticeably not wearing a brassiere. "Gentlemen, is there a problem?"<br/><br/>"No problem, ma\u2019am," said the agent not wearing a wedding ring. "We\u2019re here for Dr. Born and Orange. We\u2019re not taking them into custody, we\u2019re just taking them back to work. Hush-hush government stuff."<br/><br/>"Did they not finish their paperwork?"<br/><br/>"I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t.

Julius walked him out.<br/><br/>"Hey, doc, a word with you," said one of the agents. He put his back to the cabin as the MPs closed in to screen them from view. His fist smashed into Julius\u2019 stomach. The world seemed to whirl and sit down on Julius\u2019 chest, and he collapsed to the ground coughing. White flashes of pain sparkled in his eyes.<br/><br/>"You do <i>not</i> mess with Dr. Born, you understand? You screw up his work again, and you\u2019re going back to Germany."<br/><br/>Julius nodded his head weakly. The Feds got in the car and backed away. One waved at Julius with a smirk as they turned the cars around and drove off. He got into a crouch and was sick behind a bush.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy walked Patton, the constable, back to the car. "Good to see you again, Mr. Wright," Patton said. "Sorry about this mixup."<br/><br/>"Don\u2019t worry. And good luck with the campaign."<br/><br/>"Thank you, you\u2019ve been very generous.

Jimmy went to his office and cycled through his messages. He planned to call some of his people downtown to see if he could track down the police report from the 1926 massacre.<br/><br/>His intercom buzzed. "A Mrs. Regan to see you," said his secretary.<br/><br/>The double doors opened and a woman came in. She was tall and rangy and strong-looking. Her hair was black and wiry and parted in the middle and she had hot black eyes. She had a good mouth and a good chin. There was a sulky droop to her lips and the lower lip was full. She reminded Jimmy of Janet Rogers, somehow.<br/><br/>"Mr. Wright, I\u2019m Vivian Regan. Vivian <i>Sternwood</i> Regan, I should say."<br/><br/>"You\u2019re the daughter of General Sternwood," said Jimmy as they sat down on his office couch. "The one with the oil wells."<br/><br/>"I was hoping you could help me\u2026people have recommended you to me, because you operate in a discreet fashion. It\u2019s my sister, Carmen. She\u2019s always been a wild child, gambles a little, plays around. Nothing we can\u2019t take care of\u2014occasionally someone sends us an IOU and we pay it. She drinks a little too much, sometimes smokes marihuana, cocaine\u2026but lately she\u2019s been taking some new drug, and it scares me."<br/><br/>"What kind of drug?"<br/><br/>"I wish I knew. The butler found some empty vials in her room, and lately she\u2019s been wilder than usual\u2026she\u2019s getting herself into situations that are not good for her."<br/><br/>"Does she go to school anywhere?"<br/><br/>"She\u2019s gone to most of the finest schools in the country, but none of them for longer than a few months. We sent her to finishing school once, but they told us she was as finished as she was going to get."<br/><br/>"Harsh words."<br/><br/>"The Sternwoods are a very wild family, Mr. Wright. It helped the General win his rank and his fortune, but it does not make for a quiet home life."<br/><br/>"If it helps, I was the black sheep of my family."<br/><br/>"Then we have that in common. I know several places where Carmen might be right now. If you could talk to Eddie Mars, he might know where she is."<br/><br/>"Mars? The guy who runs gambling houses on the sly for the syndicate? Your family keeps such interesting company, Mrs. Regan. I\u2019ll look into it. I know something about this drug, I think."<br/><br/>"It makes her do things, Mr. Wright. I found her one night in an apartment in Santa Monica. There were four other people with her, and they were all naked. Doing things to each other, the men, the women\u2026they didn\u2019t care. I\u2019m worried she\u2019ll get into a place where we won\u2019t be able to help her."<br/><br/>"All right, Mr. Regan. And say hello to your husband. I enjoyed his whiskey back before Repeal\u2026and I knew some of his fellow soldiers back in Ireland."<br/><br/><i> [Chandler fans will have recognized the Sternwoods, who are characters from </i>The Big Sleep.<i> Vivian looks like Janet, of course, because I used Lauren Bacall as the portrait for Janet Rogers, and Ms. Bacall played Vivian in the movie of the book.

Eventually the derricks and cranes of the port of Long Beach came into sight.<br/><br/>Like a lot of industrial cities, the Depression had hit hard Long Beach hard. They passed boarded up shops and abandoned homes as they drove downtown. Several buildings showed damage from the 1933 earthquake.<br/><br/>One of which, naturally enough, was the First Bank of Long Beach. The ceiling of what had once been a stately neo-Georgian building had collapsed thoroughly, leaving only the wrecked shell of a building. A group of men and women who looked harder-used than the bank slouched around the cracked stone steps in front of it. <br/><br/>"Look intimidating but polite," said Ruby to Geronimo. "Be a presence, but don\u2019t instigate. I\u2019ll do the talking, and the instigating."<br/><br/>"The box may have already been looted," said Geronimo. He made sure to slip his Colt automatic into his shoulder holster.<br/><br/>They began a canvass of the people hanging around the street. Most people only knew that the bank had failed back in \u201933, along with most of the businesses in the area. Some pointed out a shabbily dressed man clutching a bottle, who was supposed to have worked for the bank once, but he angrily waved them away and scurried off. Geronimo noticed one woman looking at them. She was maybe in her forties, but had daubed rouge and powder on her face to try and look younger. Her mouth was hard and her shoulders were as slumped as the roof of the bank, but her eyes were hard and predatory, clearly used to finding the main chance. Ruby flashed a five dollar bill, and the woman ambled over. Her skirt was torn and her silk shirt stained, but she walked firmly instead of weaving like most of the men they had talked to.<br/><br/><i>[Bargain use by RP.]</i><br/><br/>"You\u2019re a pretty fancy dame to be coming around here," she said to Ruby. "Name\u2019s Delores."<br/><br/>"I\u2019d like to ask you a few questions." <br/><br/>"Hey, I didn\u2019t see nothing."<br/><br/>"No, no, it\u2019s just about the bank. What\u2019s your normal rate for an hour?"<br/><br/>"Fifty cents a dance, a buck for half an hour behind the building. I give discounts, though," she said, eyeing Geronimo.<br/><br/>"I\u2019d like to pay you your rate for an entire day. Nothing illegal," said Ruby when Delores\u2019 eyes widened. "Just to answer some questions about this area. Have anyone been in or out of this building?"<br/><br/>"When it collapsed after the earthquake in \u201933, some Feds came down. That, whaddaya call it, FDIC. That Roosevelt thing. Took all the assets up somewhere in L. A."<br/><br/>"Thanks," said Ruby, peeling off some bills. She and Geronimo drove through town until they found a drugstore with a phone book, and Ruby pulled the address of the Los Angeles Federal building.<br/><br/>"It will be after five when we get back to Los Angeles," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Have to check them out tomorrow then," said Ruby. "Let\u2019s call James first."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy called up Bernie Ohls in the D. A.\u2019s office. "Bernie. You know anything about that massacre up in the Valley in \u201926?"<br/><br/>"Not on the phone. Meet me in a couple of hours." He rang off before Jimmy could say another word. He spent the rest of the morning going through the day\u2019s paperwork and then drove down to the coffee shop near City Hall where he and Ohls sometimes met.<br/><br/>"This case is a legend in the office," said Bernie, sliding into the booth next to Jimmy. He was a medium-sized blondish man with stiff white eyebrows, calm eyes and well-kept teeth. He looked like anybody you would pass on the street. Jimmy happened to know he had killed nine men\u2014three of them when he was covered, or somebody thought he was.<br/><br/>"Everybody who comes through the office ends up looking at this case," continued Ohls. "Not the least because the D. A. never did anything about it. The only guy who had a rap hung on him was a skel named Edgar Job, and that\u2019s only because he confessed to sticking that P. I. Last guy to try and work this case over hard was Phil Marlowe\u2014it\u2019s why he got fired. Kept looking into it after the D. A. told him to lay off."<br/><br/>"I didn\u2019t know that," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Well, Phil always ranked high on the insubordination scale. That was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back, I guess. I suppose you could swing by the Cahuenga Building and talk to him about it."<br/><br/>"Think you could let me look at the files in the office?"<br/><br/>"You don\u2019t have that kind of pull, Jimmy."<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444480/#Comment_444480" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-30T17:47:35+00:00" title="March 30, 2015  5:47PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode II: Prisoners of Our Own Device (Part 3)</b><br/><br/><i>[No excuse for the long delay--the write-up for this episode has long been done. Life, amirite?]</i><br/><br/>Dr. Orange headed down to the UCLA campus. As he drove down from Pasadena, he noticed a non-descript late-model car following him. <i>Picked up a tail, </i>he thought to himself. He used his Reichsbanner training to keep his pursuer in sight until they parked at the UCLA campus. He walked quickly towards the campus library, losing his tail in the milling crowds of students.<br/><br/>"You\u2019re from Caltech," said the student librarian, putting down his copy of <i>Amazing Stories</i>. "You guys are working on rocket ships, right?"<br/><br/>"Sure are," said Dr. Orange distractedly. "Can you fetch any papers by Dr. George Ayers for me?"<br/><br/>Ayers turned out to have been interested in ancient religions, and had published some controversial papers on the witch cults of Europe, ancient Egypt\u2026and Ethiopia, where he believed that there was a cult of great antiquity in a remote area called Daillol. The abstracts were vague about the actual practice of the religion, but Dr. Ayers seemed to have believed that some form of it may have survived to the present.<br/><br/>Intrigued, Julius spent some time chasing down information about Ethiopia, and the strange stone they found in Doug Henslowe\u2019s box. He confirmed that it was from the Axum Empire\u2026and probably from the Daillol region\u2014the hottest, driest region on Earth, according to the <i>Britannica</i>. A veritable hell, in fact.<br/><br/>He went up to the Cultural Studies Department. He had pulled the number of George Ayer\u2019s off an old directory, but it was presently occupied by Dr. Miles Roman, an owlish young classics professor.<br/><br/>"Caltech? What brings you us? Need something translated from Latin?"<br/><br/>"I was actually hoping to talk about a colleague of yours\u2026"<br/><br/>"Ayers, right? You know he\u2019s still technically a professor here; they never fired him. When I got here I managed to convince the Department to let me take the office. Only took a year, so pretty fast for a university, I guess. All his stuff was dumped into storage. Go talk to Samantha, she\u2019s the Department secretary. There was a lot of strange stuff here, buddy, stuff I never recognized."<br/><br/>Samantha Burnish was one of the grey vestals of learning every well-running academic institution keeps around. She had short, curly, iron-colored hair and wore a turtleneck under her severe suit. "Dr. Ayers\u2019 belongings?" she said, lowering her reading glasses and letting them dangle at the end of the chain around her neck.  "I don\u2019t want to gossip\u2026"<br/><br/>"Of course not."<br/><br/>"He was a strange man. He hung around with a lot of <i>odd</i> people, not academics. Actors, real estate developers, some Mexican men. One time I had to take some papers to his house and they were having a really wild party. People half-clothed, running around and chanting and just carrying on. I got out of there as soon as I could, I can tell you\u2014Mr. Burnish wouldn\u2019t want me getting involved in anything like that\u2026 I made the arrangements for Dr. Ayers\u2019 trip. He went to Eritrea, I guess it\u2019s called. The Italians took it over, you know. His belongings are in storage, but if Dr. MacDunn says it\u2019s okay, I\u2019m sure you could look them over."<br/><br/>Dr. MacDunn was an avuncular white-haired man with a close-cropped beard. "It wasn\u2019t really his dig, you know. He was visiting another archaeologist\u2019s find\u2014some European professor, I can\u2019t recall the name. For a while we got some regular reports, and then they just\u2026stopped. Maybe he took sabbatical, but you\u2019d have to ask Administration about that. No objections if you want to look through his office belongings, I suppose."<br/><br/>Finally a custodian took Dr. Orange into the basement. A small storage space was crammed full of dusty boxes, more than he could hope to go through quickly.<br/><br/>He called Jimmy\u2019s office. "Mr. Wright is out on a case," the secretary told him, "but I\u2019ll give him your message."<br/><br/>Julius decided to head over to the Physics Department, where several of his colleagues greeted him warmly. He dropped into a seat in the department lounge and gratefully drank a cup of coffee. Stuart Kitchener, Edgar Job\u2019s advisor, sat with him for a while. He was paunchy and friendly, with thick horn-rimmed glasses and a hip flask he used to freshen up Julius\u2019 coffee.<br/><br/>"Heard you\u2019re doing aerodynamics now," he said. "Too bad you and Max can\u2019t continue your theoretical work\u2026Edgar Job? Smart kid, maybe not a first-class mind, but had a future. Probably would have made a good theoretical physicist, one of those guys who work down in the lab, running the cloud chamber. The kind of guy you need. That was until \u201925."<br/><br/>"What happened?"<br/><br/>"He stopped coming regularly to class, and when I did see him he seemed drunk or something. Began hanging out with a weird crowd, and his papers\u2026he was in a seminar I was teaching, and he was looking at stuff I didn\u2019t think was important. Multi-dimensional geometry of spacetime. It was a quantum mechanics seminar! Why did he bring me Riemannian manifolds? I couldn\u2019t read them. Brought them to a couple of the relativistics guys, and they said it was nonsense, too many shortcuts."<br/><br/>"Did he hang out with Dr. Ayers?"<br/><br/>"The creepy guy from Cultural Studies? Yeah, him and his oddball crowd. That was before he went to Ethiopia and got shot or went native or whatever."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444481/#Comment_444481" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-30T17:48:10+00:00" title="March 30, 2015  5:48PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode II: Prisoners of Our Own Device (Part 4)</b><br/><br/>When Geronimo and Ruby arrived home, they discovered that Luz, the cook, had quit suddenly while they were up in Arrowhead.<br/><br/>"That\u2019s what you get for hiring Mexicans, Miss Fitzgibbons," said Althea, the maid. "She said the house was hainted."<br/><br/>"Were there any prowlers?"<br/><br/>"Some men came to read the gas meter, they were our only visitors."<br/><br/>"Well. I guess there\u2019s only one thing to do. Geronimo! Get my s\xe9ance kit!"<br/><br/>Just at that moment the phone rang. "Salutations," said Ruby when Althea handed her the phone.<br/><br/>"You left a message with my office," said Jimmy. <br/><br/>"Yes. I have wonderful news, and I need two favors. The first is inconsequential. I need you to speak with the Federal Reserve Building and tell them we\u2019ll be visiting them tomorrow to see a safety deposit box from the First Bank of Long Beach. The second is, what are you doing tomorrow night, and the answer had better be that you\u2019re coming here."<br/><br/>Jimmy pressed his intercom button. "Cancel my evening appointments for tomorrow," he told his secretary.<br/><br/>"Yes, Mr. Wright. I guess the mayor will be disappointed."<br/><br/>Jimmy winced. "All right, I\u2019ll be there," he said to Ruby.<br/><br/>"Bring Herr Doktor, you know, Dr. Orange, and one other person. We must conduct a s\xe9ance."<br/><br/>"Can you reschedule those appointments?" Jimmy called out to his secretary.<br/><br/>"My cook has just left us, and I think this is connected to the more ethereal and macabre elements of the mystery we are investigating," said Ruby, unperturbed.<br/><br/>"I see no good news yet."<br/><br/>"Oh, the wonderful news you mean? My house may be haunted! That\u2019s a clue, James! Six o\u2019clock, we\u2019ll have dinner and cocktails."<br/><br/>"It was lovely talking to you," said Jimmy, and rang off. He called UCLA and eventually was connected to Dr. Orange in the Physics Department.<br/><br/>"Jimmy, I have a room full of crap I need sorting out! I\u2019m completely out of my element! Can you help me?"<br/><br/>"Tonight\u2026? Let me send Betty down to you, this is just the kind of thing she wants to do. Good chance to get her feet wet."<br/><br/><br/><br/>When she arrived, Betty turned out to be a thorough and diligent searcher. She found two small books\u2014Ayers\u2019 address book, and his appointment book.<br/><br/>"He sure seemed to spend a lot of time with this Echevarria guy," she said, looking over the books.<br/><br/>Julius flipped through the address book. "You can use that to confirm if he knew any of your suspects," said Betty helpfully. "That is, when you have any."<br/><br/>On his own, Dr. Orange turned up the source material that first attracted Dr. Ayers\u2019 attention\u2014an article about an expedition by a Dr. Bartolo Acu\xf1a, a professor at a university in Spain.<br/><br/>With Betty\u2019s help he managed to sneak several boxes of notebooks and other papers out of the storage closet. Together they went over them that night in Julius\u2019 bungalow in Pasadena.<br/><br/>Many of Dr. Ayers\u2019 notes spoke of some sort of\u2026entity involved in the dig in Ethiopia, Dr. Orange discovered. An entity he was obsessed with, some kind of ancient god named Gol-Goroth, the "Fisher From Beyond."<br/><br/>At the end of the notebook, he found a cryptic note from Ayers. "Gol-Goroth is a buffoon," it said. "How can he be the One I look for?"<br/><br/><i>[1-point Library Use spend by the Doc.]</i><br/><br/>His reverie was interrupted by Betty, who unrolled an old movie poster showing a beautiful young woman in the kind of dress Hollywood thought was ancient Egyptian. "Isn\u2019t this that Olivia Clarendon?" asked Betty. "This must be pretty old. I guess it was before she got famous."<br/><br/>The poster was signed in a flowing, feminine script: "Dear George: Thanks for everything!

It was at the far end of the town, a rambling frame mansion that had once been the summer residence of a rich man named De Cazens, and later had been a hotel. It was now a big dark outwardly shabby place in a thick grove of wind-twisted Monterey cypresses, which gave it its name. It had enormous scrolled porches, turrets all over the place, stained-glass trims around the big windows, big empty stables at the back, and a general air of nostalgic decay. Eddie Mars had left the outside much as he had found it, instead of making it over to look like an MGM set.<br/><br/>A tired Mexican band was playing waltzes as they found a booth in the corner. Jimmy handed his card to a waiter. "Tell Mr. Mars I want to talk to him," he said, and ordered drinks.<br/><br/>"I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever told me why you were interested in Winston in the first place," said Jimmy to Janet when they were alone.<br/><br/>"Well, he just died, of course, and I\u2019m doing a story on his life."<br/><br/>"An investigative report."<br/><br/>"It\u2019s clear he was into something strange."<br/><br/>"You know what is even stranger? During all my investigations your maiden name came up\u2014Edelmann, right?"<br/><br/>"I\u2019m of German descent."<br/><br/>"Winston married someone named Karen Edelmann."<br/><br/>"Yes\u2026"<br/><br/>"We\u2019ve been friends for a long time, haven\u2019t we? Long enough for me to know when you\u2019re trying to sneak one by me."<br/><br/>"What do you want me to say, Jimmy?"<br/><br/>"Just be honest."<br/><br/>"Do you want me to tell you how Dad was a bastard, and we never got on, that he treated us like strangers for years after he got back from L. A.? That he never told us anything about what had happened, but was different, hollow? He was a ghost for ten years. As for my name\u2026I didn\u2019t want anyone to know I was related to him when I started out. Walter was famous, and I wanted to prove I was a writer. So I took an alias, like your friend, Jackson Elias. Although I hope to come to a different end than her. A life cut tragically short."<br/><br/>Jimmy sputtered a bit as he took a drink. "A lot of things happened, yes," he managed to gasp out. "But I like to think I\u2019m not just anyone."<br/><br/>"If I had come to you and said I wanted you to look into my father, you would have just shrugged it off. Some kind of stupid frippery. I needed you to know there was an actual case here."<br/><br/>"I wouldn\u2019t have!"<br/><br/>"Then I misjudged you. I guess I owe you a drink."<br/><br/>"How about it cancels out? I owe you a drink for that story."<br/><br/>A man stuffed inelegantly into a tuxedo came up to the table. He looked like he could give Joe Louis a couple of tough rounds when he was out of his fancy dress. "Mr. Mars will see you now, Mr. Wright."<br/><br/>Jimmy followed the gorilla to Mars\u2019 office. This was a square room with a deep old bay window and a stone fireplace in which a fire of juniper logs burned lazily. It was wainscoted in walnut and had a frieze of faded damask above the paneling. The ceiling was high and remote. There was a smell of cold sea.<br/><br/>Eddie Mars' dark sheenless desk didn't belong in the room, but neither did anything made after 1900. His carpet had a Florida suntan. There was a bartop radio in the corner and a S\xe9vres china tea set on a copper tray beside a samovar. There was a door in the corner that had a time lock on it.<br/><br/>Eddie Mars grinned at Jimmy sociably and shook hands and moved his chin at the vault. "I'm a pushover for a heist mob here except for that thing," he said cheerfully. "The local johns drop in every morning and watch me open it. I have an arrangement with them. Now what brings a private dick down to my place? Everything that happens in this club is strictly confidential. We don\u2019t need anyone causing trouble."<br/><br/>"I\u2019m not here looking for trouble."<br/><br/>"I know you\u2019re not. I know your reputation, that\u2019s why we\u2019re talking. I know you keep things quiet when they need to be quiet, and you work with the cops but aren\u2019t in bed with them. What can I help you with? I figure if I do you a favor, maybe you can do me a favor one day."<br/><br/>"It\u2019s what makes the world go round," said Jimmy. "I had a curious visit today. One that left me curious myself. About Carmen Sternwood."<br/><br/>"Viv sent you, didn\u2019t she? Look, I let her and Carmen gamble here\u2014Rusty\u2019s a friend. But I don\u2019t have any control over that little psycho. If you want to talk to her, though, you\u2019re in luck--she\u2019s playing roulette right now."<br/><br/>"Lead the way."<br/><br/>"Just be aware," said Mars, not getting up. His expression and his voice didn\u2019t change, but there was a sudden menace in the room. "If there\u2019s any trouble, don\u2019t even bother to take it outside.

In the middle was a young woman. She was twenty or so, small and delicately put together, but she looked durable. She wore a low-cut evening gown covered in sequins, and she wore it well. She looked as if she were floating. Her hair was a fine tawny wave cut much shorter than the current fashion of pageboy tresses curled in at the bottom. Her eyes were slate-gray, and had almost no expression when they looked at him. As Jimmy got closer she smiled with her mouth and she had little sharp predatory teeth, as white as fresh orange pith and as shiny as porcelain. They glistened between her thin too taut lips. Her face lacked color and didn't look too healthy.<br/><br/>She was betting money like water, and losing a lot.<br/><br/>Janet grabbed Jimmy. "Are you here for Carmen Sternwood? Good luck, Jimmy\u2014I\u2019m going to call it an early night."<br/><br/>She kissed his cheek and sauntered off. Jimmy watched her go. She had a nice walk. Then he crowded in among the crowd around the table until he was next to Carmen. "Nice bet," he said.<br/><br/>She turned to face him, wobbling. Her eyes, the pupils huge and round and black, rolled around the room like ball bearings dropped in a bathtub. Eventually they stopped moving and locked on his face. "You\u2019re cute," she slurred.<br/><br/><i>[Me: She\u2019s at </i>least<i> drunk.]</i><br/><br/>"You\u2019re possibly the first person to ever call me that."<br/><br/>"Let\u2019s go to a playground and <i>play</i>."<br/><br/>"Sure, I know a place with great swings."<br/><br/>"I do too. Let\u2019s go to your place," she said. Jimmy pushed her back before she could crawl into his coat. A flashbulb popped nearby.<br/><br/>"Reporters," he muttered. He threw his overcoat across her shoulders and managed to guide her to his car with somewhat less struggle than it took to dig the Panama Canal.<br/><br/>As he drove up Santa Monica Boulevard, Carmen began to slip out of her dress. <br/><br/>"No!" said Jimmy, holding her down with one hand and snatching his hand off the wheel from time to time to try and fasten her dress. It wasn\u2019t too hard, no worse than juggling wineglasses in a hurricane. His car veered across lanes, but he managed to keep it on the road the majority of the time. He swung off the Boulevard and headed for Ruby\u2019s house, the closest place he could think of where it would be safe to stash Carmen.<br/><br/><i>[I gave JP a choice: make a Driving test and keep Carmen clothed, or avoid the test but have her wind up naked.]</i><br/><br/>Ruby met him at the door wearing flowing Indian silk robes and a scarlet turban. "I\u2019m trying out my s\xe9ance outfits," she said. <br/><br/>Jimmy stumbled inside, tie askew, dragging Carmen behind him. "Ruby!" she drawled.<br/><br/>"Carmen. How <i>pleasant</i> to see you again," she said, in a voice Lucrezia Borgia could have bottled and used to do in the entire College of Cardinals.<br/><br/>"I\u2019m holding," Carmen whispered in her ear.<br/><br/>"Do come in. I\u2019ll make us some drinks."<br/><br/>"Oh, I\u2019ll take care of that," said Carmen.<br/><br/>Ruby waited for Carmen to head into the parlor. "Why did you bring <i>her</i>?" she demanded.<br/><br/>"She was stripping in my car! I had nowhere else to go!"<br/><br/>"Well you\u2019re sitting next to her at the s\xe9ance!"<br/><br/>Geronimo came up the hall in a white shirt and slacks. "What\u2019s going on?" he asked crossly. "Mr. Wright, the s\xe9ance is supposed to be tomorrow. Why is there all this noise?"<br/><br/>"I had to bring Carmen Sternwood over," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Ah. The one Miss Fitzgibbons calls <i>that tramp</i>. Where is she?"<br/><br/>"In the parlor," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"You left her alone?" said Geronimo. He walked to the parlor, sweeping Jimmy and Ruby into his wake.<br/><br/>On the coffee table were three Manhattans in cut glass tumblers, elegantly finished with maraschino cherries. Next to them stood Carmen Sternwood, completely naked. It was a good look on her, although would have pulled it off better had she been able to pull off standing up without swaying. Her shredded clothes were in a messy pile on one of the sofas. There was a heavy, cloying perfume in the air, and some other odor, something mossy and exotic.<br/><br/>"Miss Carmen," said Geronimo implacably.<br/><br/>"Jerry!"<br/><br/>"Geronimo, actually."<br/><br/>"Harry, then. I\u2019ll make you a drink."<br/><br/>"Why Carmen," said Ruby, "you never told me you had your appendix out." She took the drink Carmen offered her and tossed it over her shoulder when nobody was looking.<br/><br/>Jimmy reached for a drink. Carmen smiled at him, and then shoved him in his chest. Jimmy fell back onto the carpet and Carmen swooped down on him like a condor on roadkill. She ripped open his shirt and began to kiss and lick anything she could touch, her eyes wide and her face flushed.<br/><br/>Jimmy rolled and threw Carmen off of him like she was a grenade. Geronimo reached down and pulled her up. She turned and tried to climb onto Geronimo, who caught her, staggering back with the effort. Carmen snaked her legs around his and hugged his neck with one arm. She ripped open his shirt with the other and then stuck it in the waistband of his slacks and began to reach down.<br/><br/>Ruby came up behind Carmen and pulled her off of Geronimo. Carmen spun, pulled open Ruby\u2019s robe, and began to grab and suck and bite Ruby\u2019s flailing arms. She collapsed onto Carmen and they both fell down on the floor, sprawled out. With Ruby\u2019s turban and billowing silk, they would have made a fair print for a twopenny knockoff of the <i>Kama Sutra</i>.<br/><br/>Jimmy and Geronimo closed in, circling like wrestlers and trying to do as little harm. "All of us at once!" screamed Carmen orgasmically.<br/><br/>"Fetch the chloroform," gasped Ruby. Geronimo ran out of the room and came back with a brown glass bottle. Jimmy snatched it, poured some liquid into his handkerchief, and came up behind Carmen. Ruby was still making a valiant if not altogether convincing defense as Carmen continued to press herself on top of her.  Jimmy clasped the handkerchief over Carmen\u2019s face and held it there until she collapsed, unconscious, to the floor.<br/><br/>"I\u2019d ask why you have chloroform, but\u2026" said Jimmy with a shrug.<br/><br/>"This is just like my last birthday," said Ruby, getting slowly to her feet.<br/><br/>She saw a small open vial on the sidebar.<br/><br/>She put her body between it and the rest of the room and sniffed it. The smell was mossy\u2026but intriguing. Enticing. It reminded her of new lust and old sex, of afterglow and yearning at the same time. Her fingers reached out for it without her even noticing, caressing the sides of the bottle.<br/><br/>If this was what Carmen had taken, Ruby could see that it had <i>practical</i> applications. She capped the vial and slipped it into a pocket of her robe.<br/><br/><i>[I randomly rolled who ended up nearest to the vial, and unfortunately for Ruby it was her. Ruby\u2019s drive is Adventure, and we know that she has experimented with drugs and is sexually\u2026um\u2026adventurous. So I felt that this would be a Hard Driver vs. Adventure.]</i><br/><br/>Geronimo and Jimmy took Carmen down to Luz\u2019s former room and put her to bed. A wooden crucifix looked down over Carmen from the wall, and there were still some clothes visible in the half open closet. Luz had left in a hurry.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444484/#Comment_444484" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-30T17:49:54+00:00" title="March 30, 2015  5:49PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode II: Prisoners of Our Own Device (Part 7)</b><br/><br/>An hour later, Andr\xe9 arrived at the house and was hastened up to Ruby\u2019s bedroom. "I am not to be disturbed for the night," she called out, slamming the door behind her. <i>The poison is in the dose</i>, she thought. <i>Carmen always overdid it.</i><br/><br/>"Qu\u2019est-que c\u2019est?" asked Andr\xe9 as she gave them each a drop of liquid. "C\u2019est pour l\u2019amour?"<br/><br/>"I think it\u2019s an aphrodisiac," said Ruby, not listening. She waited for something to happen.<br/><br/>For a long breath, nothing did. Then suddenly she felt  warmth spreading through her, beginning in her groin and radiating outward. Every nerve in her body grew taut as wire, and just as electric. Pleasure surged through her body, and she almost fell into an orgasm just standing there. Andre\u2019s eyes were dark and wide as he writhed in similar pleasure.<br/><br/>They came together like a thunderclap, entwining each other in their limbs. Nothing seemed able to satiate their lust and desire, and for two hours they fell into the most delirious, ecstatic lovemaking of either of their lives.<br/><br/>Some tiny part of her mind screamed in frustration. <i>It turned me on like a light switch! I have no control! What is happening to me!</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>Geronimo lay in his bed, smoking. He turned on the radio to drown out the sound of Ruby and Andre upstairs. He listened to the tail end of an evangelical program:<br/><br/>"God wants you to be happy. God wants you to have joy. Joy! The mouth of God shall speak and ye shall be healed and joyful. Come and worship God at the Temple of Joy. And send away for water blessed by God, 35 cents cash on delivery. This is the Reverend Doctor Goodman Black reminding you to be joyful, for God will drown you in his love and draw you forth again."<br/><br/>He dozed with the radio still on, the low drone of the announce blending with his dreams. In them he heard a voice, whispering words he couldn\u2019t understand, but urging him to awake, to rage, to run in the moonlight like the predator he was, to slash and tear and kill all those who had wronged him. To tear down the house. To kill everyone in it.<br/><br/>He awoke with a start. Piano music was coming from the radio, something Classical, Chopin maybe. A voice was whispering. Strange words that he could not understand, almost in time to the music, but making a harsh contrast with the melody.<br/><br/>"Soy un soldado de la Rep\xfablica Espa\xf1ola," he gasped. "My duty is to protect, not kill." He stared at the plain brown wood of the headboard, shuddering at the hissing sibilant sounds coming from behind it. Something had to be there, making that noise, but he held back for a long moment. Finally he stood up, and dragged the bed away from the wall.<br/><br/>There was a mouth.<br/><br/>It was ugly, almost lipless, a slash against the surface of the wall like a wound. Jagged, horrible teeth jutted from it, animal teeth, teeth of something terrible and unnatural. A tongue flicked in and out of the mouth, glistening with slime and far too long for the size of the mouth. It was both appalling and faintly lascivious, and for a brief incredulous second it reminded Geronimo of Carmen when she had attacked him.<br/><br/>As he stared, the mouth began to fade, seeming to slide back into the wall. He thought he saw it moving slightly up towards the corner where the wall met the ceiling. Then it was gone.<br/><br/>He sank to his knees and pulled out his rosary, praying for hours.<br/><br/><i>[So! It turns out Luz was right, the house</i> is<i> haunted. The mechanics of this were that the mouth had an ability to incite a person to animalistic urges. This called for a Stability test that Geronimo passed. Pulling back the bed was a Hard Driver against his drive of Duty, so he got back two points, but then lost three. (I\u2019m using a fixed cost Stability loss chart rather than calling for Stability tests, at least for the moment.) Finally, GP used Geronimo\u2019s Symbol, the rosary, to gain back a couple of points of Stability.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>Ruby woke up slowly, aching with both strain and remembered pleasure. The early morning sun caught the brown glass of the vial of Carmen\u2019s drug on her nightstand.<br/><br/>She seized it and tried to lick out the inside. Unfortunately there wasn\u2019t any. She had a vague memory of doing the same thing during the night.<br/><br/>When Geronimo came in he found her holding her grandmother\u2019s brooch. "She was an adventurer too, you know," said Ruby. "Always pushing back the frontiers\u2026"<br/><br/>Geronimo surveyed the literal wreckage of the room. Andre was tangled in with some sheets and the remains of a Louis XIV chair in one corner. "Anything unusual happen last night?" he asked.<br/><br/>"No\u2026nothing special." Ruby looked back down at her brooch. The need for the drug suddenly seized her again. For a moment the room seemed to go grey. <i>I could get dressed</i>, she thought. <i>But if I had some more of that drug, I could\u2026do more.</i><br/><br/>"Tea," she said. "Tea with honey, Geronimo, if you don\u2019t mind. As much honey as you can put in."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444503/#Comment_444503" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-01T20:35:28+00:00" title="April  1, 2015  8:35PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks to Simon &amp; the nice folks at Pelgrane for <a href="pelgranepress.com/site/?p=17445" rel="nofollow">giving a shout out</a> to this AP!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444504/#Comment_444504" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-01T20:36:40+00:00" title="April  1, 2015  8:36PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 1, 2015 8:38PM by Aviatrix.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode II: Prisoners of Our Own Device (Part 8)</b><br/><br/>Dr. Orange not only had his notes organized by the time Jimmy got to Pasadena, he had mercifully put on a pot of coffee. <br/><br/>"Crazy night," said Jimmy, grabbing a second cup. "I had to talk with Buchwald, my accountant on the way out. Kind of a strange guy, but good accountants can be as strange as they want in my business. Let\u2019s see what you found out." He flipped through Julius\u2019 notes. "Wait a minute. Olivia Clarendon? The movie star?"<br/><br/>"You know her?"<br/><br/>"A little bit, from around the studios. Maybe we ought to go see her."<br/><br/>"A big shot like her? What are you going to do, call the head of the studio?"<br/><br/>Jimmy smiled and used Dr. Orange\u2019s phone to call his office. "Get me Jack Warner," he told his secretary while waving to Julius to put on another pot of coffee. "Jack! How are you? You think I could have a couple of minutes of Olivia Clarendon\u2019s time today?"<br/><br/>"She\u2019s shooting that William Tell thing today. How long you need her for?"<br/><br/>"Just a few minutes, something came up in one of my investigations."<br/><br/>"All right, fine. I\u2019ll have her people call your office. By the way, I may need your help. Rumor is that I have an animation division, but I don\u2019t know anything about it!"<br/><br/>Jimmy glanced at Betty, who was reading a Porky Pig comic book. "I\u2019ll look into it."<br/><br/><i>[2-point Credit Rating spend to get to Olivia Clarendon; seemed natural that he\u2019d know Jack Warner from around Hollywood.

"Miss Clarendon can give you fifteen minutes, no more. She\u2019s on set right now and can be called back at any instant, so don\u2019t try to hold her any longer or you\u2019ll have to deal with Mr. Curtiz."<br/><br/>"No problem," said Jimmy. He knew from experience that most of making a movie was sitting around and waiting.<br/><br/><i>[It\u2019s pretty obvious from the text that Olivia Clarendon is a thinly-disguised Olivia de Havilland (I even used the fantastic and </i>still-living<i> Ms. De Havilland as the portrait for Olivia Clarendon.) So I decided to have some fun with that\u2014the big movie in 1938 for Olivia de Havilland was </i>The Adventures of Robin Hood<i>, so I figured a William Tell movie would make sense for our not-Olivia. Michael Curtiz however gets to be the director of both.]</i><br/><br/>They stepped out of the brilliant January sunshine into the darkness of the soundstage. Ahead of them they could see a set laid out like an Alpine meadow, with a half-timbered house in the foreground. The bright stage lights made everything washed out and flat looking. A couple of extras in doublets and hose walked by, carrying plywood crossbows.<br/><br/>As they came closer to the set, they saw a black-haired woman sitting in a folding chair. On the back was a star and "Miss Clarendon" in a florid script. She saw them walking towards her and stood up.<br/><br/>Close up, she was quite attractive, even with the heavy stage makeup and her ridiculous Swiss peasant costume. She had intense black eyes with just a hint of naughty good humor lurking in them. She shook hands with Jimmy\u2014a firm grip, quite American but with an air of British politeness.<br/><br/>"You\u2019re taller in the movies," said Dr. Orange, who didn\u2019t know what else to say.<br/><br/>"And even shorter without these on," said Olivia. She indicated the platform shoes she was wearing. She had an English accent that was beginning to fray into something more Trans-Atlantic. "Poor Allan quite towers over me without them. Jimmy. How nice to see you again."<br/><br/>"Good to see you too, Olivia. So you\u2019re working with Allan Swann? I hear you have to be careful around him."<br/><br/>"Well, it\u2019s best to shoot the romantic scenes early in the morning, before he can really tie one on," she said. "Nothing ruins a tender moment more than getting half a distillery in your face every time the leading man breathes. That\u2019s showbiz, I guess."<br/><br/><i>[Allan Swann is the thinly-disguised Errol Flynn character from </i>My Favorite Year<i>.]</i><br/><br/>"This is Dr. Orange. Don\u2019t worry, he\u2019s a physicist, not a medical doctor. Could we talk to you alone?"<br/><br/>"Let\u2019s go to my dressing room." They took a short walk behind the backdrops to a small private room. Various gowns designed to solve the near impossible problem of making Olivia look tall, Swiss, and from the 15th century were littered around on chairs or hung up behind the door. She sat in a rickety chair in front of a well-lit mirror and motioned them to sit down.<br/><br/>Dr. Orange quite deliberately locked the door behind him as he came in.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"What\u2019s going on?" said Olivia sharply. "I assure you that studio security will not take this sort of thing lightly. Did my sister send you?"<br/><br/><i>[Olivia de Havilland and her sister, Joan Fontaine, are the only sisters to win Best Actress.

And I was hardly the only actor trying to get ahead back then by hanging around Ramon Echevarria."<br/><br/>"How do you know George Ayers?" asked Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"That\u2019s how I met Ramon. I was doing some research for a part\u2014"<br/><br/>"<i>Research on a part</i>?"<br/><br/>"Yes. It was the Twenties. D. W. Griffith used to build Babylonian cities in the desert in those days, for goodness sake! I had just arrived in this country, I didn\u2019t know anyone, so I was looking for anything to give me an advantage. If my research could sell me with Mr. De Mille, then it would be worth it! Not that I worked with anyone so important back then. It was before the Hays Code. We did films that were racier than you can do today. I met Ayers at UCLA, and he invited me to some of Ramon\u2019s parties. I took a fellow I used to know back then, a man named Richard Spend."<br/><br/>"And what took place at these parties?" said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"They were\u2026adult entertainments of a very Continental nature."<br/><br/>Jimmy and Julius stared at her.<br/><br/>"People did\u2026things to one another. Strange things, things that\u2026aren\u2019t the ordinary way people go about that sort of\u2026thing. I don\u2019t think Ramon ever filmed it, thank God, though he may have taken pictures. Lord knows it would have made for a hell of a magazine. Nothing you could send in the mails of course."<br/><br/>She put a cigarette in her mouth but her hands shook too much to work the lighter. Jimmy lit it for her and she turned away from them, her words coming out in shaky bursts.<br/><br/>"The sex\u2026well, I was just off the boat, but not born yesterday if you understand me. When you\u2019re a woman in this business, you have to sometimes do some unsavory things. And to hear Clark talk about it, not always just the women. They were sex parties, all right? They used to drink this cocktail called Nectar. I tried it a few times; it certainly went straight to my head! Like a highball made with ether."<br/><br/>She buried her head in her hands for a moment. Jimmy waited. They always talked when they were like this, if you waited them out.<br/><br/>"Is it true," she said slowly, "that sometimes you look into cases that\u2026don\u2019t have any rational explanation?"<br/><br/>"Somebody has to," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"I\u2019ve never told anyone this, and if you tell anyone about it I\u2019ll deny it and never speak to you again. One night\u2026I could have sworn I saw a mouth form on the back of a davenport I was sitting on with some other people. And\u2026I could swear that the mouth was <i>doing</i> things with them. Well, after that, I stopped going. Ramon died not long after. And then a few years went by and I got my break."<br/><br/>"Were they all at Echevarr\xeda\u2019s house?"<br/><br/>"Yes, almost always. And that\u2019s all I can really tell you, James."<br/><br/>"Thanks. It was helpful."<br/><br/>"I just wish poor Ricky had gotten out when I did," she said wistfully.<br/><br/>"Richard Spend?"<br/><br/>"Yes. I mean, he died so horribly, with Echevarria and his people up in the Valley."<br/><br/>"Do you know much about him?"<br/><br/>"Not much. I think he was Texan originally. Had a Southern accent at least. He wasn\u2019t much of an actor, but he was very pretty. I\u2019m sure he could have gotten a break sometime."<br/><br/><br/>Jimmy drove up towards Hollywood. "This is an interesting car, Jimmy," said Dr. Orange. "The windows are so\u2026thick."<br/><br/>"Bulletproof glass."<br/><br/>"<i>Bulletproof glass</i>?"<br/><br/>"I had some incidents earlier in my career. The doors and floor are armored too."<br/><br/>"What in God\u2019s name did you used to do?"<br/><br/>"One time I tried to take out an apartment building with a car."<br/><br/>"What happened?"<br/><br/>"The building won. Got shot for my trouble too. Was just able to drive to a hospital in the 17th Arrondissment. Still send the nurses there flowers every year."<br/><br/>They pulled to a stop in front of the Cahuenga Building. It was reasonably shabby building put up around the time the all tile bathroom had become the basis of civilization. The lobby was empty except for a shoeshine stand. An automatic elevator had been put in so that the landlord didn\u2019t have to pay for an operator.<br/><br/>They rode up a few floors. The carpet in the hallway was faded and worn, and the light dim. Dust coated the corners and the doorsills of unoccupied offices. They came to one door with pebbled glass and "Phillip Marlowe, Private Investigator" painted on it in peeling letters.<br/><br/>Jimmy opened the door and a buzzer sounded. Inside was a small waiting room, with another door with a pebbled glass window opposite them. The door opened and Phil Marlowe came out.<br/><br/>He was about six foot one, strongly built, with the kind of face that could be handsome when he wanted it to be. He had a broken nose and a sarcastic twist to his lips.<br/><br/>"Jimmy Wright."<br/><br/>"Hey, Phil."<br/><br/>"Well what brings you down to my place? Am I supposed to genuflect?"<br/><br/>"Why would you?"<br/><br/>"The great James Wright comes to visit Phillip Marlowe, P. I. This about the thing in the Valley, right? Come on in."<br/><br/>Marlowe\u2019s office had the usual desk with the usual pen and blotter set. A set of mostly empty file cases were up against one wall. The window was open and the smell of frying grease came from the coffee shop across the alley.<br/><br/>Marlowe sat behind his desk, opened up a drawer, and threw a file on the desk. "Everyone who comes through the D. A.\u2019s office tries to do something with that case. They\u2019d have trouble pulling the file right now, however. I neglected to return it when I got canned."<br/><br/>Jimmy picked up the file and thumbed through the police report. The official story was that a bunch of heroin users died in an orgy out in the Valley. Jimmy carefully wrote down the lot numbers\u2014back in 1926, there hadn\u2019t been an address since the land had only recently been incorporated into Los Angeles County.<br/><br/>Reading over the file, Jimmy realized that this story should have been much bigger than it actually was, especially since it was so close to the Blackout of \u201926. He guessed that some of the victims had relatives with enough pull to bury the story.<br/><br/>The medical examiner\u2019s report showed that almost all the victims were horribly mutilated, although the cause of death is listed as "wild animals." Some investigator had added a sarcastic note to that description. Jimmy agreed; the only animal he could think of that could make wounds like that was a dinosaur.<br/><br/>Many of the bodies were found <i>in flagrante delicto</i>.<br/><br/>Echevarr\xeda\u2019s body was identified by his servants. Richard Spend\u2019s body was identified only by the wallet he had on him. In fact, most bodies were identified only by going over the street clothes, wallets and purses found scattered over the area\u2014the victims were wearing robes, or nothing.<br/><br/>The bodies of the Winston Circle were all noted in the report; they had been fully clothed. Blood trails suggested that at least a couple of people managed to escape.<br/><br/>Notations throughout the files showed that several investigators had tried to reopen the case only to be shot down by multiple district attorneys. One angry note said, "This happened five years ago out in the middle of nowhere. Everyone\u2019s dead. Nobody cares."<br/><br/>There was a notable lack of evidence of heroin found at the scene, considering that it was supposed to have been a drug-fueled orgy.<br/><br/>"You won\u2019t make anything out of this, Jimmy," said Phil. "People want this story to stay dead."<br/><br/>"Lots of people want lots of stories to stay dead. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here."<br/><br/>"Hey, you\u2019re the Pope of Private Investigation, if you say you can do it, who am I to say anything."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444514/#Comment_444514" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-02T16:15:22+00:00" title="April  2, 2015  4:15PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode II: Prisoners of Our Own Device (Part 10)</b><br/><br/>Ruby waited by the car for Geronimo to driver her down to the Federal Building. Carmen staggered out of the house and leaned on the car next to her.<br/><br/>"We have a cab coming for you," said Ruby. "They\u2019ll take you home."<br/><br/>"You know," whispered Carmen confidentially, "I know where we can find more of that stuff."<br/><br/>Inside the house, Geronimo heard a car engine start. He ran outside to see Ruby tearing down the street in her car like the Condor Legion was after her, with Carmen in the front seat.<br/><br/><i>[So! Welcome to addict land, Ruby. An obvious chance to take the drug called Nectar provokes a TN 5 Stability Test, which RP failed, causing her to take off with Carmen.]</i><br/><br/>Cursing, Geronimo jumped into Ruby\u2019s coupe and drove off after them. They drove for a while through neighborhoods that changed in character from haute bourgeois to Latino working-class.<br/><br/>"This one!" Carmen shouted to Ruby. Their car screeched to a halt in front of a shabby single-family house. A couple of men in zoot suits were standing on a lawn that was more dirt and crab grass than anything else.<br/><br/>"<i>Mira las blancas</i>," said one to the other. "You want something, girls?"<br/><br/>"We\u2019re here for the stuff," said Carmen.<br/><br/>"Go right in. Tell them El Cap\xedtan sent you."<br/><br/>Carmen practically jumped over the car door in her hurry to get in, followed closely by Ruby. Geronimo pulled up just in time to see her vanish inside the house.<br/><br/>"What are you here for?" said one of the zoot suiters in Spanish.<br/><br/>"I\u2019m with the young ladies."<br/><br/>"Oho! Looks like we have an educated man, eh Profether?" said the other zoot suiter, mocking Geronimo\u2019s Castilian accent. "You should go away. We don\u2019t need you here."<br/><br/>Geronimo opened the door very deliberately and walked around the hood of the car. He didn\u2019t look that frightening. No worse to tangle with than, say, a grizzly. "That young lady is my responsibility," he said, fixing his calm gaze on the tough.<br/><br/>"Your <i>rethponthibility</i>," said the zoot suiter, but he was clearly shaken by Geronimo\u2019s determined air of menace. "Go right in. We\u2019ll watch your car and make sure it\u2019s okay."<br/><br/>As Geronimo walked in the door, he saw one of the thugs making a beeline for a pay phone.<br/><br/><i>[Sense Trouble by GP.]</i><br/><br/>Inside, Carmen and Ruby found a card table with a man sitting behind it. He had an open crate filled with packing straw behind him, and a cigar box full of cash on the table in front of him. He seemed bored with the routine, but also had the self-satisfied smirk of any dealer. <br/><br/>"What do you need?" he said to them.<br/><br/>"Let\u2019s see," said Carmen, counting on her fingers. "Let\u2019s say\u2026ten. You want any, Ruby?"<br/><br/>Ruby pulled out a wad of cash and dropped it into the cigar box. He handed over a set of glass vials. "There\u2019s a room in the back," he said. Carmen was already walking into it.<br/><br/>Ruby held the vials with a trembling hand. She tried to stuff them in her purse...but found herself licking out the inside of one of the vials.<br/><br/>One of the zoot suiters carried her into the back room.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"You here to work for us, or are you buying?" asked the man behind the table in Spanish when Geronimo entered the house.<br/><br/>"Where did those ladies go?"<br/><br/>"They\u2019re in the playroom."<br/><br/>Geronimo started towards it. "Whoa," said the man. "If you want to go in the playroom, you got to <i>play</i>."<br/><br/>Geronimo tossed down a few bills and resumed his walk towards the room. "Hey!" shouted the man. He heard footsteps behind him as he yanked open the door.<br/><br/>The floor of the playroom was a writhing mass of limbs and naked flesh. Moans and gasped escaped from it, and it undulated like a wave with shocks of pleasure. He recognized an ankle tattoo and pulled on the leg. Ruby slid out, glistening with sweat and other fluids.<br/><br/>"Geronimo," she drawled. "Are you here too? Come join us."<br/><br/>"Miss Fitzgibbons, we have to go."<br/><br/>"But we just got here\u2026"<br/><br/>"Come. I will take you home. We will call Mr. Andr\xe9."<br/><br/>With difficulty he pulled her upright. He found the remnants of her dress near the door and pulled it over her, then draped his overcoat over her shoulders and pushed her through the door.<br/><br/>Several tough looking men were waiting for him there. "Hold on," said the man who had been behind the card table. "You just wait here. The Captain\u2019s coming down to talk to you."<br/><br/>"What does he have to do with anything?"<br/><br/>"You don\u2019t just pull our clients out."<br/><br/>"She paid, didn\u2019t she? Now I\u2019m taking her home."<br/><br/>"Look, your choice. You wait here and make this right with the Captain, or we take you down in the basement and shoot you both."<br/><br/>In response, Geronimo lit a cigarette. He held on tightly to Ruby, who was swaying next to him. After several uncomfortable minutes, the front door opened and a man came in.<br/><br/>He wasn\u2019t tall, but he managed to be intimidating all out of proportion to his size. Maybe it was his face, pock-marked and rough, with vicious, active black eyes that gleamed from under his heavy brow. He had a thin pencil moustache, and wore a zoot suit of dark color and impeccable tailoring.<br/><br/>"I\u2019m Captain Walker," he said in a gravelly voice. "Why are you taking one of my clients out of here?"<br/><br/><i>[I\u2019m using </i>El Pachuco<i> era Edward James Olmos for Walker\u2019s portrait.]</i><br/><br/>"She is my employer, and I am taking her home."<br/><br/>"You understand that your employer will now have need of our services."<br/><br/>"Yes, but she can partake of them at home."<br/><br/>"I haven\u2019t met you. I should have met you before. You\u2019re not Mexican."<br/><br/>"No."<br/><br/>"But you are Spanish. That\u2019s better than nothing."<br/><br/>"I\u2019m not robbing you of a client, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about."<br/><br/>"That is not in your power in any case. She is now our client--forever. But you understand my problem. You came to my house, you pulled her out of the place, you showed me no respect. I don\u2019t need someone screwing up our relationships with the cops, or with the nice people who do business with us."<br/><br/>"No disrespect meant. But I will protect my employer. And your client. There is nothing else to say."<br/><br/>Walker took a drag on his cigarette. "Very well, Se\xf1or. We know many things about you, Mr. Cuevas. Understand that you are being watched, you have been watched, and you will continue to be watched."<br/><br/>Geronimo managed to keep Ruby from assaulting him or the controls of the car long enough to get back to their house. He secured her to the bed with her restraints, and sat downstairs smoking while Ruby shrieked in frustration.<br/><br/>After a couple of hours she fell unconscious.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444638/#Comment_444638" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-08T02:26:49+00:00" title="April  8, 2015  2:26AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode II: Prisoners of Our Own Device (Part 11)</b><br/><br/>Jimmy pulled up to Ruby\u2019s house along with Dr. Orange. "Shouldn\u2019t take long," he said to Julius over his shoulder. "Just need to talk to Carmen for a minute."<br/><br/>Althea met him at the door. "Mr. Jimmy, we are having a horrible day here today. Miss Ruby is out of her mind again. She was just like this last night too. I don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do!"<br/><br/>"What was she like?"<br/><br/>"Not my place to talk, Mr. Wright! I just think I should find a new situation for myself. You need a cleaning lady, Mr. Wright?"<br/><br/>"Was she acting like that lady I brought over last night?"<br/><br/>"Miss Carmen? Oh, yes. I saw her talking to Miss Ruby earlier today, and they both drove away in a hurry. Mr. Cuevas had to go chase after them. When he brought her back she was out of her mind."<br/><br/>They found Geronimo inside, sitting on the stairs in the hall, taking out the last cigarette in his pack.  "She drank the vial, didn\u2019t she?" Jimmy said.<br/><br/>"Yes," said Geronimo, lighting his cigarette. "She is lost to us now."<br/><br/>"I brought Herr Doktor with me, so we should keep him away from the vial."<br/><br/>"Miss Fitzgibbons purchased several more this afternoon."<br/><br/>Jimmy sighed. "Let me guess, Carmen is gone too."<br/><br/>"Yes. Also, we are being watched by the drug gang."<br/><br/><br/><br/>While Jimmy and Geronimo were talking, Ruby slowly came back to her senses. Once again, the world seemed strangely grey. There was a roaring in her head like the ocean. She could almost make out words in the rush of white noise. Her body ached and she arched her back in frustration.<br/><br/>There were more vials in her purse, she realized.<br/><br/>"Althea," she croaked.<br/><br/>"Oh my!" said Althea, coming into the bedroom. "You okay, Miss Ruby?"<br/><br/>"Could I have some water? Oh, and hand me my purse."<br/><br/>Althea brought Ruby a glass of water and her purse. She helped undo Ruby\u2019s restraints.<br/><br/>"Thank you, that will be all," said Ruby with a beatific smile.<br/><br/>Sixty-one seconds later she came bounding down the stairs. She slid into Jimmy and wrapped her legs around him gently, like a giant squid embracing a sperm whale. "Oh, <i>James</i>," she said.<br/><br/>"Not again!"<br/> <br/>"Who let her get this stuff!" shouted Geronimo, trying to pry Ruby off of Jimmy. Ruby managed to twist free and began crawling toward Dr. Orange. "Oh come on," she said to Julius as Geronimo grabbed her ankle. "I know you\u2019re not a monk of science!"<br/><br/>Jimmy grabbed Ruby and wrapped an arm around her neck in the way Francis O\u2019Donnell had once showed him. He pulled back and let his joints compress her carotid artery until Ruby slumped forward, unconscious.<br/><br/><i>[I let JP make a 2-point Scuffling spend to apply a sleeper hold.]</i><br/><br/>"Help me get her upstairs!" Jimmy grunted.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy almost sent an associate to check out the house in East L. A., but then thought better of sending people around to a place where the most addictive drug he had ever heard of was being sold.<br/><br/>Ruby woke up after an hour. "I think I\u2019ve had a very bad day," she said to Geronimo when he came into the room. She knew what would make the day better, but her purse was nowhere to be seen.<br/><br/>"Carmen always overdoes things," she said to Jimmy when he came upstairs. "I figured that I would know how to handle it."<br/><br/>Jimmy sat by the bed trying to console Ruby, but she was much too agitated to listen to him.<br/><br/><i>[JP wanted to do Psychological Triage, but had to make the roll naked because Jimmy only has a couple of Psychoanalysis points.

"There\u2019s only one man who can lift her spirits when she\u2019s like this."<br/><br/>"Who\u2019s that?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Captain Murphy," said Geronimo, making it sound like being sent to a firing squad. Althea shook her head as she picked up the room and muttered something evil-sounding under her breath.<br/><br/>"I don\u2019t get it," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Wait a while. You\u2019ll find out," said Geronimo.

Dr. Orange was making notes.<br/><br/>"You know, I could probably synthesize a compound like this Nectar," he mused. "I would need to study it some more\u2026"<br/><br/>"Let\u2019s not worry about that now," said Jimmy quickly.<br/><br/><i>[Me: You want to make a Nectar methadone?

He was tall and dark, with slicked back black hair and a pencil moustache. He was wearing a khaki shirt with a silk scarf folded around his neck and tucked into the collar, duck slacks and boat shoes.<br/><br/>"Where\u2019s Ruby?" he said, tossing a yacht captain\u2019s hat onto a chair. "She said she needed to talk to me, and I have tonight free. We don\u2019t sail to Borneo until tomorrow morning. Jerry, how are you doing?"<br/><br/>"I am fine. Miss Fitzgibbons is in her bedchamber. I must warn you, she is very ill."<br/><br/>"What\u2019s she got? The D. T.s? The flu?"<br/><br/>"No, she has been addicted to a new drug."<br/><br/>"Well, Ruby\u2019s a great gal but she\u2019s got a frail constitution, you know, and a weak mind. But other than that she\u2019s a capital lady. Who the hell are you guys?"<br/><br/>"Jimmy Wright."<br/><br/>"Dr. Orange."<br/><br/>"Oh, a Kraut? Well that\u2019s okay. They\u2019re really turning things around there now, I hear."<br/><br/>Julius punched him in the nose. <br/><br/>It wasn\u2019t a hard punch\u2014street brawling wasn\u2019t in his Reichsbanner portfolio\u2014but it caught Murphy by surprise.<br/><br/>"Better men than you have tried that!" shouted Murphy. "Why don\u2019t you step outside with me, you damn Kraut! Come on, put up your dukes and fight like a man!"<br/><br/>Jimmy stepped in between them. "I think you should be helping Ruby," he said.<br/><br/>"How can we trust this guy? He\u2019s one of them Huns! He cold-cocked me!"<br/><br/>"I\u2019m pretty sure that if he cold-cocked you, it\u2019s because you insulted him."<br/><br/>"You talk pretty tough, <i>Jimmy</i>."<br/><br/>"I apologize for the doctor," said Geronimo smoothly. "But we need you to see Ruby."<br/><br/>"All right Jerry," sighed Murphy. "We\u2019re all here to help Ruby. Just make sure you get rid of that Kraut!" He stormed upstairs as Jimmy and Geronimo took a still-fuming Dr. Orange into the kitchen for some coffee.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Few things could give Captain Murphy pause, but the sight of Ruby tied to the bedposts apparently was one of them. "Well Ruby, I didn\u2019t know it was going to be one those housecalls," he said.<br/><br/>"Oh Murphy, you bastard," said Ruby, smiling.<br/><br/>"That\u2019s magnificent bastard to you."<br/><br/>"You are a magnificent bastard. Now shut up and kiss me. Use your lips right for once!"<br/><br/>"So what\u2019s your poison, Ruby? What happened to you?"<br/><br/>"Carmen Sternwood. She hooked me. She hooked me bad."<br/><br/>"So what are you chasing? The China dragon? Brazilian marching powder? That Mary-juwanna?"<br/><br/>"You know I don\u2019t do the hard stuff anymore!"<br/><br/><br/><br/>The evening concluded with the ceremonial pitching out of Murphy by Geronimo, who used a new throwing motion to put an extra twist on the Captain as he sailed out over the porch steps. He came back to the kitchen. Jimmy shoved a container of fried rice at him\u2014he\u2019d made a quick run for some Chinese food.<br/><br/>A large map of Los Angeles County was spread out on the table. Jimmy pointed to a spot in the San Fernando Valley with a chopstick. "That\u2019s the place where it happened," he said.<br/><br/>"How do you use those things?" asked Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"Learned how when I was in Shanghai. The lot\u2019s off a county highway now, but back in \u201926 it was just a dirt road."<br/><br/>"Do you know anything about this entity Gol-Goroth that Ayers was interested in?"<br/><br/>Jimmy shivered. "I hope it\u2019s not the same one I\u2019ve read about. Gol-Goroth is an ancient god. A really bad one. Pretty evil. His worshipers used to do human sacrifice to him. They call him the \u2018Fisher from the Outside\u2019  and he\u2019s supposed to live on the moon. The theosophists say he was worshipped in Mu and Lemuria, but they\u2019re full of it. There\u2019s not a great description of him, but usually the words <i>toad like</i> and <i>hooved</i> come up."<br/><br/>"And that scares you?"<br/><br/>"No. What scares me is that Ayers wasn\u2019t sure it was him. Which means it could be something much, much worse." He got up from the table.<br/><br/>"Where are you going to?" asked Geronimo.<br/><br/>"I\u2019ve had a long day. I\u2019m going home. Just let me call the office."<br/><br/>From the extension in the entry hall he dialed up Janet Rogers.<br/><br/>"Yes, Jimmy?"<br/><br/>"You busy tonight?"<br/><br/>"No, Jimmy."<br/><br/>"I\u2019ll be over in fifteen minutes."

The cup of tea Althea brought her had more than enough honey but no Nectar. She understood vaguely that there would probably never be enough Nectar for her.<br/><br/>"We destroyed the other vials," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Good," said Ruby with all the cheer of a condemned man ordering his last meal.<br/><br/>"Mr. Wright called. He said he talked to the people in the Federal building. Going there would have been a waste of time\u2014the safety deposit boxes are all in a warehouse in Long Beach."<br/><br/>"I think a day trip would be very healthy for me."<br/><br/>"Good. Jimmy will be here in a few minutes."<br/><br/>All four of them rode down in Jimmy\u2019s large sedan. Jimmy kept up a light and bright patter, paying close attention to Ruby during the trip. She seemed much better without the temptation of nearby Nectar.<br/><br/><i>[JP succeeded in Psychological Triage and restored some points of Stability to Ruby.]</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>They spent the middle part of the day waiting for the bowels of the Federal bureaucracy to digest their request for the safety deposit box, but eventually a bored clerk brought it out to them. They drove down the coast a little bit and got rooms at a pleasant seaside motel.<br/><br/>Inside the box, they found a great deal of photographs of people having sex, maddened, raving, passionate, insane sex. It was obvious that they were under the influence of Nectar. The photos were mostly taken in opulently decorated houses, and judging by the jewelry the women wore (they wore nothing else), the people involved were all well to do.<br/><br/>One man recurred in most of the photographs\u2014a darkly handsome, well-built Latino man, almost certainly Ramon Echevarr\xeda.<br/><br/>One blurry photo was of a man, still clothed, with a chubby, handsome face and curly blond hair. A note on the back indicated that it was of Richard Spend.<br/><br/>"So that\u2019s what he looked like," said Jimmy. "All his movies were destroyed when the studios went out of business."<br/><br/>Under the photos was a ledger book covering the years 1919-1926. It was clear they were accounts of some kind, but the entries are in code. On the inside of the cover is a nameplate indicating that they were prepared by an Abram Buchwald.<br/><br/>"Isn\u2019t that your accountant?" Dr. Orange asked Jimmy, who shook his head in disbelief.<br/><br/>They gave Ruby the account book to decode, to keep her mind busy. By evening she had gotten far enough to give them the name of another cult member: Samson Trammel. Jimmy called his office and put some of his operatives on tracking the distribution of Nectar. "Just don\u2019t take it. Don\u2019t look at it. Don\u2019t even smell it."<br/><br/>"What is it, like heroin?" asked Eccleston, one of his better operatives.<br/><br/>"Much worse. Take J. J. and Walsh with you."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Betty drove Jimmy back to his apartment after dropping off Dr. Orange at Ruby\u2019s house. "Late night, Mr. J," she said. "Almost midnight."<br/><br/>They pulled into the underground garage and Betty parked the car near the elevator bank. As Jimmy stepped out, he heard a shot go off, very nearby.<br/><br/>From the shadows stepped Bethany Mae Hampton, holding a small but deadly-looking automatic pistol.<br/><br/>"Why, hello Jimmy!" she said brightly. "How are tricks?"<br/><br/>"Fine on my end. You?"<br/><br/>"Just fine. But you need to stop what you\u2019re doing. It\u2019s not going to help anything. And just so that message comes through clear\u2014"<br/><br/>She waved at the shadows with the hand not holding the gun. Three tough-looking men came running out. They had shaved heads and angry expressions. They looked like they were from Southeast Asia. They ran towards Jimmy almost on all fours.<br/><br/>"Get down, Boss!" shouted Betty, bracing a shotgun on the roof of the car. She fired off both barrels as Jimmy flattened himself onto the pavement. Bethany screamed, and the toughs pulled up short.<br/><br/>Jimmy rolled up to his feet clutching a crowbar he had snatched from the ground. He swung hard at the closest thug and connected solidly with the side of his head. The other two men threw open-hand strikes at him. <i>These guys know what they\u2019re doing</i>, he thought as they struck him. <i>Probably know some kind of kung fu</i>. He noticed an odd tattoo on the neck of the man he had clubbed.<br/><br/>"Get in the car," he screamed at Betty. He swung his crowbar in a wide arc to create some distance between him and the men, and then jumped up on the running board. Betty peeled out, slamming the driver\u2019s door shut as they crested the ramp to the street.<br/><br/>At a stoplight Jimmy pulled open the front door and slid into the passenger seat. "Did I do good, boss?" asked Betty. "It\u2019s in the handbook, the part Mr. O\u2019Donnell wrote: when transporting Firm executives, drivers will always keep a loaded shotgun in the car."<br/><br/>"Glad you read all those books," said Jimmy. "Better head back to the office."<br/><br/>Once he was back at his desk, he made a drink and looked through some of the books he kept in a locked cabinet. Finally he found the symbol he had seen tattooed on the man\u2019s neck. It was associated with an esoteric branch of Siamese Buddhism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444710/#Comment_444710" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-09T13:52:25+00:00" title="April  9, 2015  1:52PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode II: Prisoners of Our Own Device (Part 14)</b><br/><br/>"Let\u2019s take stock," said Ruby the next morning. Jimmy poured himself a cup of coffee as he sat down next to Dr. Orange. Geronimo pulled the curtains shut and quietly told Althea to leave them alone for a few hours.<br/><br/>"What are our leads?" Ruby asked.<br/><br/>"Samson Trammell," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"The Valley," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"We should go to the scene of the crime," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"I should contact Doug," said Jimmy. "And find out more about Anne Robinson." He rubbed his jaw where one of the thugs had hit him.<br/><br/>"Then let\u2019s head out to the Valley today," said Ruby. She left to change into her visiting-a-farm outfit.<br/><br/>Jimmy put in a long-distance call to Joy Grove. "You need to talk to <i>who</i>?" said Dr. Keaton.<br/><br/>"Doug Henslowe."<br/><br/>"Well, all right, if you boys up in Washington need us to help you\u2026"<br/><br/>After a long wait, Doug came on. "You find it?"<br/><br/>"Found it, and more."<br/><br/>"It\u2019s still going on, isn\u2019t it."<br/><br/>"Sure looks like it."<br/><br/>"You going out to the Valley?"<br/><br/>"Our next stop. I think I ticked Bethany off last night."<br/><br/>"It\u2019s much easier to watch Edgar with her gone. You talk to Janet?"<br/><br/>"I did. We had a nice conversation about her family."<br/><br/>"Listen. We only dealt with the L. A. part. We had suspicions that they were into much bigger things."<br/><br/>"Ethiopia?"<br/><br/>"Maybe. Maybe the Far East as well. Be careful. And let me know what\u2019s going on."<br/><br/><br/><br/>"It\u2019s a beautiful day," said Ruby as they drove out to the San Fernando Valley. "You know what would make it better?"<br/><br/>"Forget it, Miss Fitzgibbons," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>Jimmy handed a pistol to Dr. Orange and, after a moment, another one to Ruby. "Just in case," he said.<br/><br/>He and Geronimo checked their own sidearms. "My office got back to me before we left," said Jimmy. "Richard Spend had a sister, she works as cleaning lady. Maybe we should check her out."<br/><br/>They drove through some orange groves and pulled up onto the abandoned farm that had been the site of the 1926 massacre. They walked for a while until they came upon the burnt-out ruin of the farmhouse.<br/><br/>"Anyone else notice that?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Something\u2019s off," said Dr. Orange. "It\u2019s\u2026eerie. I don\u2019t like the way things <i>feel</i> here."<br/><br/>Nearby they could see a construction crew digging foundations on the next door lot. A man ambled over and waved his hand in greeting.<br/><br/>"Can I help you?" he said in a broad Ozark accent. "You supposed to be on this property?"<br/><br/>"Excuse me," said Ruby regally, "I just bought this property yesterday."<br/><br/>"Well, you bought a hell of a property. I think it\u2019s kind of a pig in a poke, myself."<br/><br/>"What are you guys doing?" asked Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Putting in a new subdivision. Seems folks want to live all the way out here. Even fixing up the old power distribution station over there."<br/><br/>"You know about this lot?"<br/><br/>"Yeah, I know about this lot," said the man, rubbing his forehead and looking away.<br/><br/>"You seem to know a lot about it," said Ruby. "I love a macabre story."<br/><br/><i>[Assess Honesty use by RP indicated the worker was holding back.]</i><br/><br/>"Well\u2026there\u2019s something wrong with this place. A couple of workers got bit by things\u2014snakes, a rabid dog. I have stay out here some nights. Pitched my tent here one night. I ain\u2019t Daniel, don\u2019t put much stock in dreams, but I ain\u2019t never want to have dreams like those again. And I haven\u2019t, cause I don\u2019t pitch my tent here no more."<br/><br/>"I\u2019ve heard sometimes land can become <i>cursed</i>," said Ruby.<br/><br/>A big man with a heavy potbelly rolled over to them. It cost him a lot of effort. He was wheezing like a steam tractor by the time he arrived. "All right, break it up you lazy bastard. Get back to work. And you! You got a reason to be out here? We got all our permits. It ain\u2019t safe for you to be out here."<br/><br/>Jimmy noticed the foreman casing his car, almost as if he was trying to memorize his license plate number.<br/><br/>"Let\u2019s take a walk," said Jimmy, leading the foreman away from the rest of them. "See that man?" he said, pointing at Geronimo. "I can barely keep him on his leash. Maybe it\u2019s time to take him off the leash, understand?"<br/><br/><i>[Intimidate use by JP.]</i><br/><br/>"Hey, now wait a minute. I\u2019m an honest man, I got kids.

Gave me a sawback, told me to call him if anyone came out to look at the place, and if I did, there\u2019d be more money in it. Times are tough, mister. I could use the dough."<br/><br/>"What did he look like?"<br/><br/>"Tall, curly hair. Kinda tough, but not tough tough. Read Jewish to me somehow."<br/><br/>"Give me his number," said Jimmy, slipping the guy a twenty.

Dr. Orange took some samples of ash from the farmhouse. Suddenly Ruby screamed in pain.<br/><br/>"That cat bit me!" she wailed.<br/><br/>"We need to grab it for a rabies test," said Geronimo, chasing after the cat. He cornered it under a bush. The cat hissed at him. Its teeth were odd, jagged and longer than they should have been. He swept it up in his coat and carried it back to the others.<br/><br/><i>[1-point Outdoorsman spend to catch the cat.]</i><br/><br/>"Look at the mouth!" said Ruby. "It must be rabies! It\u2019s mutating!"<br/><br/>"I heard a story about a mouth like that," said Jimmy. "Something about a mouth like that appearing during one of Echevarr\xeda\u2019s orgies." <br/><br/>"Did it move? Did it speak?" said Geronimo, in a strained voice.<br/><br/>"No. It appeared on the couch. And\u2026they said that the mouth was joining in the, uh, activities. It had a long tongue."<br/><br/>"The couch joined in the orgy," said Ruby skeptically. "James, I thought I was the one with the problem."<br/><br/>"Story I heard," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Why are you interested, Geronimo?" asked Ruby.<br/><br/>"Nothing. Just a ridiculous story."<br/><br/>Jimmy pointed towards the ground. "Looks like some kind of cabling got run out here, a long time ago," he said. "From the power distributor they\u2019re fixing."<br/><br/>The rabies test on the cat was negative. But everyone who saw the cat at the hospital was disturbed by its horrid, ragged teeth, and its sticky, far too long tongue.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The next day Ruby called the number Jimmy had gotten from the foreman. The rest of them watched her from the living room couch. The phone rang once, and then a voice came on. <br/><br/>"Trinity 6661," it said. <br/><br/>"Yes, I\u2019m looking for a private investigator by the name of Jack," said Ruby, snuffling.<br/><br/>"Who gave you this number?"<br/><br/>"A man I met at a bar last night said I could find a good P. I. at this number."<br/><br/>"Okay, lady, calm down."<br/><br/>"I think he\u2019s cheating on me!"<br/><br/>"Fine, lady. Tell you what. Meet me at the Santa Monica Pier. 5:30 tonight. Come alone. I see you with a tail, you ain\u2019t gonna find anyone. What\u2019s your name?"<br/><br/>"Norma Jean."<br/><br/>The phone rang off.<br/><br/>"We\u2019re not letting you make the meet alone," said Jimmy after Ruby explained everything.<br/><br/>"He\u2019ll never meet us if he sees a tail."<br/><br/>"Leave it to us," said Geronimo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ruby reached the Santa Monica pier at 5:30 pm exactly. As she made her way to the end of the pier, she had to fight back the urge to just run away and find some Nectar. <br/><br/>"Steady old girl," she muttered, stopping near the railing by the side of the pier. "Keep it together."<br/><br/>The sunset was especially beautiful that night. She watched the clouds and the sea for a long time, waiting. A young Mexican boy walked up to her and handed her a note.<br/><br/>"What\u2014" she said, but the boy had already run off. Ruby studied it. It indicated a path behind some of the sheds and buildings at the very end of the pier. She flourished the note in the air and walked out to make her rendezvous.<br/><br/>She squeezed through a narrow alley between two fish fry shacks and down a set of narrow stairs. She was on a landing a little below the level of the rest of the pier. Another flight of rickety stairs led down to a boat tie-up below. The tide was in, and waves crashed and foamed around the pilings of the pier.<br/><br/>"Hold it right there," said a rough voice from behind her. "Don\u2019t move. Don\u2019t turn around. I\u2019m going to frisk you."<br/><br/>She was patted down quickly and professionally. Whoever was behind her grabbed her handbag and rummaged through it. He laughed. "Hi, Ruby," he said. "Turn around."<br/><br/>Ruby turned and saw a man standing in the shadows. He stepped forward slightly and the last light of sunset caught him in the face. He was tall, with curly hair, and a hang-dog face. He needed a shave. His heavy-lidded eyes were fixed on her. He had a mouth that was twisted by long habit into a smirk. He held a small snub-nosed revolver in his hand. At the moment it wasn\u2019t pointed at anything important to her, but she stayed very still.<br/><br/>"How\u2019d you get that number?" he said.<br/><br/>"That foreman you paid off gave it to me."<br/><br/>"You can\u2019t keep anybody bought in this town. Ten bucks used to get you something." He put the pistol in his belt and lit a cigarette, never taking his eyes off of her. "Listen, you need to lay off this. You don\u2019t need to find out anything more about this. Keep this up, and you\u2019ll call the forces of hell down on you. I ain\u2019t working alone."<br/><br/>"Look, I\u2019m not trying to start too much trouble, but some of our friends have been hurt by what\u2019s going on. We\u2019re just trying to make sure they\u2019re all right."<br/><br/>"Lay off it already. You ever hear of Jimmy Wright?"<br/><br/>Ruby boggled. "The name sounds familiar."<br/><br/>"You screw with us, you\u2019re screwing with Jimmy Wright. You just keep that in mind. Now turn around."<br/><br/><br/><br/>From his perch on top of the Hippodrome, Dr. Orange watched Ruby with binoculars. He saw her turn away from his line of sight. A tall man in an ill-fitting suit climbed up to the Pier and walked briskly towards the main drag. The man pulled his hat down and did his best to fit into the crowd.<br/><br/>"Hello, my little friend," whispered Julius. "So you\u2019re the one who followed me to UCLA."<br/><br/>He waved a handkerchief as the man passed a couple of fishermen standing next to the railing. Jimmy nodded, knowing Dr. Orange had him in sight, and started packing up the fishing rods while Geronimo slipped after the man. <br/><br/>After a short walk, Geronimo\u2019s quarry got into a small black car and drove away from the pier. Geronimo jumped into Ruby\u2019s coupe and swung out after him, quickly catching up to him. He faded back, keeping a few cars ahead of him as he tailed the other man.<br/><br/>They drove into the deepening twilight. The bright lights of Santa Monica faded behind them. The car pulled off into El Segundo. He followed it through an industrial neighborhood of rundown, almost identical warehouses.<br/><br/>The other car parked in front of one of the warehouses. The driver got out, walked to a door in the side of the building and pressed a button next to it. He waited a moment, and then pulled the door open and stepped inside.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"I have questions, Mr. Wright," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"It\u2019s not <i>James</i> anymore?"<br/><br/>"No. We need to have a conversation. A man held a gun to my face and told me I shouldn\u2019t get involved in this case because you would come down on me for it. That messing with him was messing with Jimmy Wright."<br/><br/>"I have absolutely no idea what that means."<br/><br/>"James, who are you working for?"<br/><br/>"A dear friend of mine."<br/><br/>"A man held a gun to my face. I\u2019m a little uneasy and out of Nectar. So I may not be responsible for my actions."<br/><br/>"Tell me what he looked like." He waited for Ruby to finish embellishing the story of her encounter with him. "Sounds like I guy I looked into hiring once, a P. I. named Jack Pizner. I ended up deciding he was too rough for my crew. Why he\u2019s peddling my name around town I don\u2019t know."<br/><br/>Ruby was about to say something cutting when Geronimo pulled up in her car. "Follow me," he said. "I found out where he works."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444785/#Comment_444785" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-13T16:22:39+00:00" title="April 13, 2015  4:22PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode II: Prisoners of Our Own Device (Part 16)</b><br/><br/>Night had fallen by the time Jimmy, Ruby, Geronimo and Dr. Orange arrived at the warehouse. Jimmy raised his hand to the buzzer, paused for a long moment, and then stabbed at the button.<br/><br/>There was a buzzing sound, and he heard the door unlatch.<br/><br/>Inside was a dirty staircase ascending to another door, painted dull grey and with no sign on it. Jimmy pulled it open and saw a small entry way a beat-up steel desk was beside it, facing the door he had come through. Behind the desk was a man in a security guard\u2019s uniform, and behind him was a pair of double doors.<br/><br/>"I\u2019m here to see Jack," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"He know you\u2019re coming?"<br/><br/>"Just tell him Jimmy Wright is here."<br/><br/>"Oh! I\u2019m sorry Mr. Wright, I didn\u2019t recognize you. Sure, come on in!" The guard got up and unlocked the doors and held them open as they passed through them.<br/><br/>Jimmy blinked.<br/><br/>Behind the door was an office reception area. The furniture was new and modern, all glass surfaces and chrome tubing. Sunken lights in the ceiling gave the area a warm glow. Behind a receptionist\u2019s desk sat a pretty young woman in rimless glasses. In back of her he saw an open space with several rows of desks, and doors that probably led to small offices ringing the area. There didn\u2019t seem to be any windows.<br/><br/>Painted on the wall over the receptionist\u2019s desk was "Wright-O\u2019Donnell Investigations" in the curling script of his own logo. Beneath it, in small capitals, was printed "SPECIAL BRANCH".<br/><br/>"We\u2019re here to see Jack," said Jimmy. The receptionist pointed him toward an office in the back. "Excuse me," she said as Ruby, Geronimo, and Dr. Orange walked past her. "Who are you people?"<br/><br/>"We\u2019re with him," said Ruby imperiously.<br/><br/>"What\u2019s going on?" Geronimo asked Jimmy.<br/><br/>"I don\u2019t know\u2026unless it was Francis. My partner," he said. "The O\u2019Donnell part of the firm."<br/><br/>Jimmy knocked on Pizner\u2019s door, and then strode in. The office was small and had no window. The carpet was new but dirty. A sweat-soaked shirt was tossed over a file cabinet, and papers were piled up on the straight-backed chair near the wall. <br/><br/>"Whaddaya want?" barked Pizner. His feet were up on his desk and a bottle of whisky was parked near his phone. He practically folded in half when he recognized Jimmy. "Mr. Wright! I never thought I\u2019d have the honor of\u2026hey\u2026wait a minute! Ruby! What gives?"<br/><br/>"He\u2019s escorting me," said Ruby, unable to suppress a smirk.<br/><br/>"Well, I\u2019m confused," said Pizner, reflexively reaching for his bottle.<br/><br/>"You\u2019re not the only one," said Jimmy, snatching it away. "What is this place?"<br/><br/>"Huh? It\u2019s your office, Mr. Wright. We all work for you. This is Special Branch. We handle the tough cases, the stuff that needs to be hush-hush."<br/><br/>"Did O\u2019Donnell hire you?"<br/><br/>"I\u2019ve never met Mr. O\u2019Donnell."<br/><br/>"Did <i>I</i> hire you?"<br/><br/>"No, no you did not. You met with me, said that you\u2019d think about hiring me. Then I got a call. Some lady told me to come down to this place. They gave me a bunch of tests, and then they hired me."<br/><br/>"What lady?"<br/><br/>"Didn\u2019t get her name. Thought she was one of the receptionists."<br/><br/>"The <i>receptionists</i>?"<br/><br/>"I don\u2019t know any more than that!"<br/><br/>"How come you know Ruby?"<br/><br/>"I got orders to follow her, to follow the doc, and to stay away from the big guy because he was tough."<br/><br/>"Who gave you the orders?"<br/><br/>"I thought you did. I got them the normal way\u2014memo in my inbox, subject Ruby Fitzgibbons, subject Julius Orange. Standard operating. I\u2026I need to go make a phone call." He hopped out of his chair and tried to push his way to the door. Ruby stuck out her leg and tripped him.<br/><br/>"Okay, okay," said Pizner after Jimmy pulled him off the floor. "I know why you\u2019re here, Mr. Wright. You have to understand, it started with me just doing favors for the guy. But then it got serious, and I had no way out! I had to keep giving him information."<br/><br/>"Who are you working for!"<br/><br/>"You! And, well, I work with a rough crowd. You need to have contacts when you do that. Feelers in the criminal network, like you wrote about in the FBI newsletter last month! I made contact with this guy in East L. A., up and coming gangster type."<br/><br/>"Was his name Captain Walker?" asked Ruby.<br/><br/>Pizner went pale. "You\u2019re sent by him," he said, eyes wild. "Tell him I didn\u2019t do anything wrong!"<br/><br/>"What exactly did you do?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"I would tell him what I was working on, and he\u2019d slip me some dough. If I had to bring in some skel, he\u2019d help out. He had a standing order that I should tell him if anyone looked into that farm or the police report about the massacre. Couple of days ago I got put on Ruby, so I told him. He seemed interested."<br/><br/>"Mr. Wright," Geronimo whispered in Jimmy\u2019s ear, "I saw the receptionist call someone as soon as we left her desk. You should be alert."<br/><br/>"Why are you using the name of Wright and O\u2019Donnell?" demand Jimmy.<br/><br/>"I\u2014we work for you!"<br/><br/>"You work for me by tailing my own friends?"<br/><br/>"I didn\u2019t know they were with you! It\u2019s probably some kind of bureaucratic cockup," said Pizner, sweating. <br/><br/>"I want a written report from you by tomorrow. On my desk," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Your desk here, or in the other office?"<br/><br/>"The other office\u2014I have a desk here?" <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445001/#Comment_445001" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-29T17:08:29+00:00" title="April 29, 2015  5:08PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode II: Prisoners of Our Own Device (Part 17)</b><br/><br/>Dr. Orange had spent the time watching the door to Pizner\u2019s office. He noticed that a steady stream of receptionists and typists were heading toward the back of the bullpen. He ducked his head out. The only people left on the floor were male Special Branch investigators.<br/><br/>"Trouble," he said to his friends. "We should check the back door."<br/><br/>Past the bullpen they found a narrow corridor that led to a locked door labeled "Maintenance". Ruby put her ear to it. "Betty, you destroy the last batch of files," said someone behind the door. She had a commanding tone. "Last one out, pull the fire alarm. We\u2019ll all meet downtown."<br/><br/>"They\u2019re destroying files!" shouted Ruby.<br/><br/>Jimmy and Geronimo kicked the door open. A bunch of women were tossing bundles of files into the incinerator chute. They took off as soon as they saw the men burst into the room.<br/><br/>Ruby tackled one of the women, but the rest fled down the back stairs and scattered into the dark streets.<br/><br/>"They had everything prepared for destruction," said Dr. Orange. "That\u2019s the kind of things we did in the Reichsbanner. That\u2019s real tradecraft! Counter-espionage protocols!"<br/><br/>They dragged their prisoner with them to an office labeled "James Wright, Esq." The interior was extremely comfortable\u2014a clean, walnut desk, positioned beneath a skylight, with an elegant leather chair behind it.<br/><br/>There was a sideboard and small bar. Jimmy noticed it was stocked with his favorite brand of whiskey.<br/><br/>"Give me the room," said Dr. Orange grimly. He locked the door behind them, leaving him alone with the woman.<br/><br/>"Who are you?"<br/><br/>"My name is Lucy Miller. I work for James Wright. My social security number is\u2014"<br/><br/>"Wrong answer!" said Julius. He slapped her across her face.<br/><br/>"My name is Lucy Miller\u2014"<br/><br/>"Try again!" He slapped her a second time.<br/><br/>"My name is\u2014don\u2019t hit me! I\u2019ll tell you what I know. I work here. It\u2019s a branch of Mr. Wright\u2019s agency, completely top secret. I was hired right out of college. One of my sorority sisters, Penny, recruited me. We were all Epsilon Sigmas here. I just did what they told me. I was told not to ask questions, and I didn\u2019t."<br/><br/>Julius poured her a glass of water. "Wait here," he said. He stepped outside.<br/><br/><i>[Interrogation use by OP.]</i><br/><br/>"You know anything about some sorority called Epsilon Sigma? It seems they recruited all the receptionists here."<br/><br/>"Wasn\u2019t that the one that was trying to recruit Millicent?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"James," said Ruby, "I accept your apology. Though it is strange that one of the world\u2019s greatest private detectives didn\u2019t know about an entire branch of his own agency."<br/><br/>"It\u2019s not impossible," said Dr. Orange. "After all, I rely on my girl to keep my schedule straight, and the department has its own accounting office\u2014"<br/><br/>"Buchwald," said Jimmy. "We need to go talk to him."<br/><br/>One of the Special Branch investigators stuck his head in the door and pointed at Ruby. "Hey, sweetheart, you new here? I need something typed and my girl isn\u2019t\u2014holy Toledo, Mr. Wright!" Soon the office was flooded with colleagues, all of whom wanted to shake Jimmy\u2019s hand, and ask him for a raise.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445002/#Comment_445002" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-29T17:08:58+00:00" title="April 29, 2015  5:08PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode II: Prisoners of Our Own Device (Part 18)</b><br/><br/>"They didn\u2019t know too much about you," said Ruby to Jimmy as they drove to Buchwald\u2019s apartment. "When have you ever been in Russia?"<br/><br/>"Never. I\u2019m more interested in how they got hired. Somebody\u2019s been very thorough at recruiting these guys. Mailing out letters to guys who passed the FBI test, or ones I interviewed."<br/><br/>"I liked their work arrangements," said Dr. Orange. "Just get a memo, type up the report when you\u2019re done. Very efficient, and they have so much freedom to follow their own cases."<br/><br/>"I liked the commendations you wrote for them," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"I didn\u2019t write any of them!" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>They pulled up to the apartment building just in time to spare Jimmy more ribbing. It was six stories tall, in a nice middle-class Jewish neighborhood. Whatever his other flaws, embezzlement didn\u2019t seem to be one of Buchwald\u2019s sins.<br/><br/>A woman on the far side of middle-age opened the door to the Buchwald\u2019s apartment. "Can I help you gentlemen, and lady?" She had a faint Yiddish accent.<br/><br/>"I need to speak with Mr. Buchwald," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"And you are?"<br/><br/>"His boss."<br/><br/>"Mr. Wright! Please come in, come in. Abram has told me all about how much he enjoys working for you. Come, sit down. Do you want some tea? I\u2019m making dinner. It\u2019s nothing, it\u2019s a little brisket. I\u2019ll get you some matzoh ball soup. It\u2019s not good, but if you would have some for me, it would be nice\u2026"<br/><br/>Mr. Buchwald came out in his undershirt. "Mr. Wright!" he said. "What do I owe the pleasure?"<br/><br/>"I\u2019d like to go over some details of the books with you."<br/><br/>"Couldn\u2019t it wait until morning?"<br/><br/>"Let\u2019s do it after dinner," said Jimmy, glaring at him.<br/><br/><i>[Intimidation use by JP.]</i><br/><br/>They spent a pleasant and extremely filling meal with the Buchwalds. Mrs. Buchwald started to put away the dishes, but Mr. Buchwald told her to go to bed. "I\u2019ll take care of that, Esther," he said. "I need to talk a little business."<br/><br/>After she left he got up and poured brandy for all of them. "What can I help you with, Mr. Wright?"<br/><br/>"In the course of my recent investigation, I came across a P. I. who was investigating me."<br/><br/>"It\u2019s the Pinkertons, yes?"<br/><br/>"No. From Wright-O\u2019Donnell."<br/><br/>"But that doesn\u2019t make any sense, Mr. Wright."<br/><br/>"No. It doesn\u2019t. But it\u2019s a bit rich coming from the man who does my books."<br/><br/>"This is about Special Branch, isn\u2019t it?" Buchwald paused. "Mr. Wright," he said, "I think we both understand that I was hired because I know about\u2026standard practices in this industry. The thing is, Mr. Wright, it\u2019s like this: if you were in a sub-legal profession, you wouldn\u2019t want to hire a criminal attorney\u2014you\u2019d want an attorney who was a criminal. The same applies to the business I am in, and the business you are in. And I come very highly recommended in that line."<br/><br/>"Indeed. You worked for Mr. Echevarr\xeda, didn\u2019t you?"<br/><br/>"That was a dark time. I don\u2019t like to talk about it."<br/><br/>"We\u2019re going to talk about it! Because I\u2019m investigating Echevarr\xeda, and you\u2019ve been hiding an entire branch of my company from me!"<br/><br/>"It was set up\u2026well, I saw memos. They all seemed to be from you. Over time I noticed that you never asked me about it, never wanted to see the books\u2014but it wasn\u2019t my place to say anything. I thought maybe it was Mr. Francis\u2026but I don\u2019t think so any more. Anyway, they make you a lot of money."<br/><br/>"Let\u2019s talk about Echevarr\xeda."<br/><br/>"Thank God I met Ethel. She made an honest man of me again," Buchwald said, shaking his head. "I was Mr. Echevarr\xeda\u2019s accountant from 1919 to 1926, when he died horribly, God rest his soul. I hope God rests his soul. He was not a very godly man. I wasn\u2019t either back then. Now I go to synagogue every week, I always have the best seats on the high holy days\u2014I know the best rabbi in Los Angeles, if you ever need anything like that."<br/><br/>"Thanks, I guess."<br/><br/>"Mr. Echevarr\xeda was into sex orgies. He had this drug, Nectar\u2014"<br/><br/>"Do you have any?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"I never knew where it came from, and I don\u2019t have any now. I don\u2019t know where Ramon came from, how he made his money\u2014back in Mexico, I guess. One day at the end of 1925 I came to him. Told him I had the books done, but he didn\u2019t care. Abram, he says, in a few weeks we won\u2019t need to ever pay taxes again. I thought maybe we\u2019re going to move offshore. No, he tells me. Abram, you know I worship this god, Gol-Goroth. He\u2019s not really a god, but an intelligence from outer space beyond our puny capabilities."<br/><br/>"He said that?" asked Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"He used to talk like that. There were all these people in the cult. God forgive me, I used to do what they did. I even took Nectar."<br/><br/>"How did you get over it?" asked Jimmy.<br/><br/>"It\u2019s not easy. Every day, I have to force myself not to go look for it. But I know that if I do, Esther will leave me. I\u2019ll never see my girls again, and since I\u2019m paying enough for their college I should be able to see them, yes? And my grandchildren, when I have them God willing\u2014"<br/><br/>"Geronimo," said Ruby, "I think I need to marry a Jewish girl."<br/><br/>"Anyway," said Buchwald, giving Ruby a disapproving look, "one day some men came around. Said they were cops, but me, I was not too sure. They acted more like\u2014well, more like how you act, Mr. Wright. There was a tall guy. German. You can always tell. And some big macher from New York, talked all tough. Ricky told me at a party, he saw them too. Echevarr\xeda didn\u2019t care. He told me that by the middle of January none of it would matter. Abram, he told me, those who follow me in the way of Gol-Goroth are deceived. None of them understand my real work. Prepare yourself. Prepare yourself for the end."<br/><br/>"What do you think he meant?" asked Jimmy.<br/><br/>"I didn\u2019t know. But I wrote him a nice letter of resignation, and never saw him again. And of course he died a few days later, in the middle of January. Such a shande."<br/><br/>Silence fell heavily on all of them.<br/><br/>"Do you have children, Mr. Wright?" Buchwald asked finally.<br/><br/>"No. But I have a niece and nephew."<br/><br/>"Watch over them well. Whatever Ramon was up to, it\u2019s not over yet. I know that at least one person from the old cult is up to something, that meshuggah Samson Trammell.  Real estate guy, bought up a lot of land after Ramon died. Except. I did not know him well in those days, met him once or twice. One of my businesses is in the real estate line. At a closing, I met Samson Trammell. But it was not the man I knew as Samson Trammell."<br/><br/>"Who was it?"<br/><br/>"I don\u2019t know. He had all the paperwork to say he was Samson Trammell. What do I care, a name is as good as another. That\u2019s not what scares me. What scared me was later. I put on the radio, and I hear the voice of the man who said he was Samson Trammell, that same stupid Texas accent. Except he called himself Goodman Black."<br/><br/>"I\u2019ve heard that name," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Yes, Mr. Wright, I bet you have. He has his own radio program. A religious program. And from what I hear, he has a lot of people who worship with him now."<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445280/#Comment_445280" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-20T14:45:20+00:00" title="May 20, 2015  2:45PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So!

(Prologue)</b><br/><br/>Scientists tell me that most human emotions are caused by various chemicals. "It\u2019s all hormones," they\u2019ll say, or neurological feedback mechanisms, or imprinting. Corner a Freudian and they\u2019ll blubber something about dreams and mothers and maybe even make you think they actually believe all that. But bottom line, it\u2019s all a biological process. Things click when they come in range, or they don\u2019t.<br/><br/>But you just try telling people about that. I mean, they just won\u2019t believe you. Sure, I can see the ones who have something at stake\u2014it would about put half of Hollywood out of business, not to mention all those dime store novels you can pick up. Somebody\u2019s writing and printing those, though it\u2019s my guess that they\u2019re a lot more clear-headed about the whole operation than those who watch or read that stuff. But most people? They\u2019ll either babble on about free will, or about having been fated to meet someone (who just happened to live in the same town, and come from a pretty similar family, and know a lot of the same people; honey, I know about fate, and that\u2019s not what it looks like.) That those two positions are really incompatible doesn\u2019t faze them at all. But that\u2019s human beings for you; never let the pesky details get in the way of a good story.<br/><br/>Maybe that\u2019s why Ruby and company were so scared of Nectar. I mean, when you get down to it, what harm was it doing? It just made you want to do the thing everybody says they enjoy doing more than anything else. Everyone\u2019s happy while you\u2019re on it. You have a good time. And if you feel bad after, well, just take some more. And it\u2019s the exact same excuses about how love can\u2019t be chemicals\u2014free will, fate, blah blah blah.

It was the first day of the new term, and several of her friends were buzzing excitedly about taking Archaeology that morning.<br/><br/>"What\u2019s so great about that class?" she asked. It was her first class that day.<br/><br/>"You\u2019ll see," said an upperclassman with a smirk.<br/><br/>And she did, a half hour later, when the door to the lecture hall opened and a handsome man in his mid-forties stepped in front of the blackboard. He was tall, black-haired except for a distinguished touch of grey at his temples. "Good morning," he said in a French accent that probably revved the engines of most of the girls like a race car. "My name is Dr. Luc Fauche. Now, who here knows anything about ancient Ethiopia?"<br/><br/>Millicent shot her hand up. "There was something called the Axum Empire there."<br/><br/>"Very good! Excellent!" Dr. Fauche looked quite impressed.<br/><br/>After class, he beckoned her over. "Every year I take a student as an assistant. I would like you to be my aide this year, if you can."<br/><br/>"Thank you, yes!"<br/><br/>"<i>Bon</i>. This is Marie Forgeron, my graduate assistant," he said, indicating a young woman in her mid-twenties.<br/><br/>"<i>Bon jour</i>," she said diffidently. Millicent thought her accent sounded colonial\u2014maybe R\xe9union or one of the African colonies.<br/><br/><i>[1-point Languages spend by MP to recognize the accent. Forgeron is a little allusion to the last campaign\u2014she\u2019s the daughter of Francis O\u2019Donnell\u2019s friend, Guy.]</i><br/><br/>"Ah, and Miss Lowell? We\u2019re doing a little exhibition of Egyptian artifacts at the library. Perhaps you could assist?"<br/><br/>"It would be my pleasure," said Millicent. She had to fight herself to keep from floating out the door.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>"Miss, I need you to turn around carefully," said a man behind Millicent.<br/><br/>She turned slowly. She was wearing her nightgown. Behind her, a concerned security guard was holding a flashlight on her.<br/><br/>She was standing in the middle of the ancient Egyptian exhibit in the school library.<br/><br/>Her hands were bloody.<br/><br/>"What am I doing in the library?" she said.<br/><br/>"You tell me," said the guard. "But looks like you smashed open a pane in the door with your hands there."<br/><br/>The room spun and went black.<br/><br/>She came to in a bed in the school infirmary. Her advisor was sitting by the bed. "Millicent, why did you break into the library?" she said.<br/><br/>"I don't know!"<br/><br/>"Is there a history of somnambulism in your family?"<br/><br/>"I...don't know."<br/><br/>"Well, under the circumstances, maybe it would be better if you went back to Los Angeles for a while."<br/><br/>"But what about Dr. Fauche! I promised to be his assistant!"<br/><br/>"I'm sure he'll understand."<br/><br/>"Maybe I can have Senator Grey write him for me."<br/><br/>The older woman stiffened.

In his office he found Ruby reading one of the recruitment pamphlets he liked to hand out to detectives who looked like they wanted some extra work. <br/><br/>"James," she said, "How long does it take to become a private eye? Can I do it in an afternoon? I already have a hat, does that help? Also\u2026it might keep my mind off of certain other obsessions of mine."<br/><br/>Jimmy tossed her one of the Junior Detective badges he kept around to hand out to schoolkids. "Here you go. You\u2019re an honorary PI."<br/><br/>Jack Pizner slouched into the room, looking as guilty as a hanged man and about as lively. "I got that report you asked me to write," he told Jimmy.<br/><br/>"I shouldn\u2019t have asked you to come here," said Jimmy. "Now you\u2019re blown. Let me see what you\u2019ve got."<br/><br/>The list was interesting. It seemed that his clandestine branch had solved several cases that he hadn\u2019t been able to crack. It also was obvious that Pizner had been giving Walker information for several years.<br/><br/>"None of the receptionists showed up at the other office today," said Pizner. "Weird, yeah?"<br/><br/>"Yeah. Keep in touch, okay?"\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>Dr. Orange went down to the Los Angeles FBI office. The agents tried to give him the bum\u2019s rush, but  Top Secret clearances go a long way with the Feds. He played his into a long look at everything the Bureau had on Goodman Black/Samson Trammell. It wasn\u2019t much, mostly adding up to "harmless crackpot," although there was some poking around in his real estate affairs. The connection with Captain Walker was noted, along with the belief that Walker was fleecing Black\u2019s richer clientele for security payments.<br/><br/>One thing that stuck out was the large building Black owned in Echo Park called the "Temple of Joy." He was able to pull some architectural plans for the Temple building, and made copies of whatever Hoover\u2019s boys left unattended.<br/><br/><i>[2-point Bureaucracy spend by OP; I ended up giving him a pool of points to use vs. Samson Trammell.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>"Boss, we trailed those skels you put us on out to Echo Park, believe it or not," said J.J.\u2019s voice over the phone. "Ecclestone's gonna check out some addresses and Walsh and I will tail them further."<br/><br/>"Remember keep your distance," said Jimmy. "Oh, and when you get back, I need you to check into a sorority for me."<br/><br/>"Sure...though boss, why don't you put one of the girls on it?"<br/><br/>"They're busy," said Jimmy quickly, and rang off.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>Dr. Orange arrived at Jimmy's office to find the familiar feeling of a siege. <i>Amateurs</i>, he thought, remembering his days running from the Nazis. He quickly briefed the others on what he had found out from the FBI.<br/><br/>"Wait, did you say Echo Park?" said Jimmy. "I've got my guys tracking nectar shipments to there."<br/><br/>"I may not be a private investigator--" said Julius.<br/><br/>"I am," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"--but I think there's a connection there."<br/><br/>As if on cue, the phone rang.<br/><br/>"Boss, boss!" shouted Walsh on the other end. "Boss, they got J.J.!"<br/><br/>"Where are you?"<br/><br/>"I...oh God, they're here!"<br/><br/>Jimmy heard the phone drop and dangle against the side of the phone booth. From somewhere near the receiver came the sound of a shot. He heard slow footsteps approach the phone, and then it was quietly hung up.<br/><br/>"Let's go," said Jimmy. He led them on the run to the garage. Betty was leaning against the car, reading a Porky Pig comic.<br/><br/>"Boss?" she said.<br/><br/>Jimmy popped open the trunk of the car and took out a couple of shotguns. He handed them to Geronimo and Dr. Orange. "Echo Park," he said, jumping into the back seat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445289/#Comment_445289" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-21T15:24:18+00:00" title="May 21, 2015  3:24PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode III: What Kind Of Love Have You Got?

He pointed at the bloody body slumped over the steering wheel. "That was J.J."<br/><br/>A cop was directing traffic away from the crash site. Geronimo spoke quickly with him.<br/><br/>"Probably a gang hit," said the cop. "Somebody blasted him as he was going along the street. There's reports of gunshots a couple of blocks over, in the park."<br/><br/>Geronimo slipped him a fiver. "I'm going to take a look. Guy was a colleague."<br/><br/>Inside the car he found a scribbled map, covered in blood, at J.J.'s feet. He gave it to Jimmy, and then they headed out toward the park.<br/><br/>"Blood," muttered Jimmy as they entered the park, pointing at streaks of red near the path.<br/><br/>There was a gang of zoot-suited men a couple of hundred feet inside the park. Ruby strode up to them, her best getting-to-know-you grin plastered on her face. "Oh dear, did you hear the shots?" she said to them.<br/><br/>"We heard the shots," said one of the men. "This is a dangerous place for you to be, lady. Not safe."<br/><br/>"Oh, my goodness. Well, I'm glad <i>you're</i> here to watch out for trouble," she said as disingenuously as possible.<br/><br/>"Yeah, you should stay here. Or maybe go to a cafe. You like cerveza? we could get a beer..."<br/><br/><i>[Flattery use by RP.]</i><br/><br/>Dr. Orange skulked around the crowd and managed to scramble up onto a bench. He saw a body at the center of the crowd. As he watched, one of its hands moved a little. <br/>Captain Walker and large men generously wrapped in gabardine arrived and stopped in front of Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Mr. Wright," said Walker.<br/><br/>"I want my man," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"And what should induce me to do you this favor, considering that we have already taken care of one of your investigators."<br/><br/>"You mess with one of mine, and I'll mess with you."<br/><br/>"I am messing with you, Mr. Wright. But I can understand wanting your man back. I will be happy to give him back. But you will stop your investigation of me, or there will be consequences. And I don't make threats, sir. I make promises. <i>Vamanos</i>," said Walker, gathering his troops around him.<br/><br/>As soon as they left, Jimmy and Dr. Orange rushed in and carried the badly wounded Walsh back to the car.

Geronimo lounged nearby, smoking.<br/><br/>"Hello?" said Ruby into the phone, waving Millicent towards the couch. "No, we can't do that. Well, he's probably cheating on you, that's why. Honey, go down to the salon, get yourself made up, and find a man to make the same mistake <i>he</i> did. Oh, and tell your husband I voted for him."<br/><br/>"You're manning the office, Miss Fitzgibbons?" asked Millicent.<br/><br/>"James and I are now partners."<br/><br/>"Oh, that's good news, isn't it?"<br/><br/>"Yes. He made that noise he makes when he's pleased."<br/><br/>"The one he made around the studio?"<br/><br/>"That's the one. What are you doing back in LA, dear?"<br/><br/>"I seemed to have sleepwalked...sleptwalked...in any case, I broke into the library. But before that I was trying to find out about that sorority. Oh, and I'm working for a really dreamy Frenchman, he's our archaeology teacher. I'm his assistant..."<br/><br/><i>Professor--French--Dreamy</i>, wrote Ruby on a pad. "There's something very strange afoot. Did you do anything unusual? Take any drugs? Read anything with strange writing on it?"<br/>"Just hieroglyphics." <br/><br/>"There's a web, Geronimo," said Ruby. "A <i>web</i>."<br/><br/>"I haven't heard anything inexplicable," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"I know! I'll hypnotize her! Then we can find out what happened!"\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>At the hospital, a surgeon found Jimmy. "I'm sorry, Mr. Wright, the damage was too severe. We've made him comfortable."<br/><br/>"I understand," said Jimmy.<br/><br/><i>[OP: He got shot in the plot!]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy sat down next to Walsh's bed.<br/><br/>"I'm sorry," croaked Walsh. "It's the temple, Boss. That's where the drugs are coming from."<br/><br/>"I saw the files," said Jimmy. "We're going to get them where it hurts."<br/><br/>Walsh nodded, and closed his eyes. After a moment longer, he stopped breathing.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>As he stepped off the elevator, several of Jimmy's receptionists mobbed him, shoving phone messages at him:<br/><br/><i>WHO'S ANSWERING THE PHONE FOR YOU?</i><br/><br/><i>WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?</i><br/><br/><i>WHO'S </i>RUBY<i>?</i><br/><br/>Jimmy hurried into his office. The blinds were drawn and the room was dim. He saw Ruby waving a watch in front of Millicent's eyes. "You are getting sleepy...sleepy..." said Ruby. "You will recall all the events of the night you broke into the library."<br/><br/>Slowly, haltingly, Millicent described waking up suddenly and feeling like something was moving her limbs...something compelling her, almost against her will, forcing her to walk out of her dormitory and break into the library.<br/><br/>As the full horror of what had happened hit her, she screamed, jolting out of the trance.<br/><br/><i>[4 point Stability loss for remembering what happened. And at this point, I charged Jimmy a point of Stability and Doc Orange and Geronimo a point each, to cover Walsh's death.]</i><br/><br/>Ruby poured Millicent a drink. Jimmy shrugged and poured himself one. He sat staring glassy-eyed as Millicent explained about her research on the Epsilon Sigma and why she had been sent back early from school.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445307/#Comment_445307" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-22T20:27:28+00:00" title="May 22, 2015  8:27PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode III: What Kind Of Love Have You Got?

She picked up the phone and quickly dialed a number. "Max? Ruby."<br/><br/>"Haven't heard from you in forever! You having one of those charming garden parties? With the bowl of cocaine?"<br/><br/>"Not until the weather gets better. Listen, darling, I've found myself lately quite taken with radio. Do you think I could drop by the station and see how things are done?"<br/><br/>"Of course. When were you thinking?"<br/><br/>"I have a late lunch, so...around six PM."<br/><br/>"Uh...that might not work that well. Why don't you come the day after--"<br/><br/>"Max, I understand, and for you--anything. I'll move my lunch and come a little earlier."<br/><br/>"Actually, it's really not such--"<br/><br/>"What? Geronimo? Sorry, I have to go, Max."<br/><br/><i>[Credit Rating spend by RP to create a useful contact.]</i><br/><br/>Geronimo looked up from his crossword puzzle long enough to shake his head sadly. As soon as Ruby put the phone back in its cradle it rang again. Jimmy scooped it up. "I answer the phones in this office, all right?" he said, glaring at Ruby. "Jimmy Wright."<br/><br/>"Mr. Wright, this is Lt. Lou Escobar of the LAPD. I just found a dead man on Route 1. Had your card in his wallet. Fellow by the name of Pizner. Maybe we should talk about it."<br/><br/>"Howabout lunch?"<br/><br/>"Howabout you meet me at the station."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>An hour later Jimmy found himself sitting in an interrogation room faced by Escobar. He was a tough cop; Jimmy recognized the type immediately, the kind that had gotten his start in the back alleys and tough streets of East LA and Chinatown. He had the sadness honest cops get when they\u2019ve been on those beats for too long, the resignation of a man who is corrupt and can no longer even want to be something other than he is, but still remembers the kind of man he wanted to be. Sitting on a stool in the corner was a big uniformed cop named O'Malley. He had a pleasant, open face, and hands that had been broken in fist fights many times.<br/><br/><i>[Escobar is the same character from </i>Chinatown<i>.]</i><br/><br/>"So tell me what this guy was doing for you," said Escobar.<br/><br/>"What do private eyes do?"<br/><br/>"Tell me what he was doing today."<br/><br/>"He was helping me investigate the relative of a client."<br/><br/>"And that got him killed?"<br/><br/>"Sometimes things go deeper than we expect."<br/><br/>"Seems a lot of people are dying around you lately, Mr. Wright. A couple of your guys got shot up in Echo Park yesterday. Scared a lot of nice people." Escobar slammed a fist on the table. "Tell me what they were working on! I want names!"<br/><br/>"There's a new drug in town. It's horrible. One try and you're hooked. I had them looking into it."<br/><br/>"I didn't notice you getting posted to the Vice Squad. What was this skel Pizner looking into, and what were Walsh and Jackson up to?"<br/><br/>"Walsh and Jackson were following leads, nothing else."<br/><br/>"I'm sorry," said Escobar. "I have to turn my back now."<br/><br/>O'Malley stepped up to the table. "Sorry about this, Jimmy." He smashed a meaty fist into Jimmy's face, knocking him out of his chair.<br/><br/>Jimmy struggled back into his seat. His jaw slowly moved back into its normal place. It hurt a little less than falling off a cliff. "The drug is what did it. Following it got them hurt."<br/><br/>"That's not your concern. You know you're supposed to bring this to us."<br/><br/>"How much do you know about these zoot suiters," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Oh, them. I better go clear this with my Captain." Escobar opened the door, paused for a moment, and then nodded at O'Malley as he left.<br/><br/>"I have a lot of respect for you, Mr. Wright," said O'Malley, rolling up his sleeves. "But now I gotta hurt you."<br/><br/>It was a professional beating; Jimmy never blacked out. After twenty minutes they tossed him into a holding cell to think things over. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Eternal Lies: Masks of the Liar [Trail of Cthulhu] - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20049/eternal-lies-masks-of-the-liar-trail-of-cthulhu/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Eternal Lies: Masks of the Liar [Trail of Cthulhu] - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20049/eternal-lies-masks-of-the-liar-trail-of-cthulhu/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Episode III: What Kind Of Love Have You Got?

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode III: What Kind Of Love Have You Got? (Part 6)</b><br/><br/>Ruby, Dr. Orange, and Geronimo pulled up to the studios of KLAX. A large bus was parked out front, slathered with images of the <i>Reverend</i> Doctor Goodman Black. Max met them in the green room.<br/><br/>"This is really not a good time, Ruby," he said. "Dr. Black doesn't like to be disturbed during broadcasts." He nodded at the door to the studio. Two large men stood by it, looking uncomfortable because their jackets only reached their thighs. They were clearly Walker\u2019s men.<br/><br/>"Is that a <i>chorus</i> I hear?" said Ruby, cocking an ear at the monitor speaker.<br/><br/>"Yeah, the Doctor likes to bring them down as backing," said Max.<br/><br/>Dr. Orange listened to the hymn. He was reasonably familiar with most Christian hymns. This song, with its repeated references to "The Mouth of God" didn't sound like any hymn he knew.<br/><br/><i>[Theology use by OP.]</i><br/><br/>"Excuse me," he said. "I need to get some coffee."<br/><br/>After another fifteen minutes, the door to the studio  opened and a tall, gaunt man in a black suit, surrounded by a coterie of secretaries and what Ruby guessed were lay ministers, emerged.<br/><br/>"All right, all right, all right," Dr. Black said. "Good show tonight, everyone."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>Dr. Orange made his way downstairs to a coffee shop next door to KLAX. He ordered a cup of coffee, picked up the sugar shaker, and then dropped it in his coat pocket when the waitress turned around.<br/><br/>He slipped outside and nonchalantly leaned against the side of the bus. He unscrewed the gas cap and poured the entire contents of the shaker into the gas tank.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>"Here you go, my dear," said Goodman Black, passing an autographed flyer to Ruby. She glanced at it:<br/><br/><i>REVIVAL MEETING! THIS SATURDAY AT THE TEMPLE OF JOY!</i><br/><br/>They followed Black and his disciples downstairs and watched them board the bus. It drove slowly up the avenue. After several blocks it slowed down and stopped by the curb. The driver stepped out and opened the hood of the bus. He rubbed his head with a puzzled expression on his face.<br/><br/><i>Right on time</i>, thought Dr. Orange, stepping off the curb and holding his paper cup of coffee. "Can I be of assistance?"<br/><br/>"You know anything about engines, Mac?"<br/><br/>"Of course! You can't be an engineer without knowing engines! Although I mostly deal with <i> quantum</i> mechanics."<br/><br/>The driver looked at him, puzzled.<br/><br/>"I make a little joke. Let me have a look."<br/><br/>"Can you do anything? The boss wants to get out of here as soon as possible."<br/><br/>Dr. Orange poked around for a few minutes. "Looks like you got some bad gas," he said.<br/><br/>Goodman Black and two of his security guards were waiting by the door of the bus. "Any chance we can get this thing moving? I need to get back to the temple."<br/><br/>"The <i>temple</i>?"<br/><br/>"Yes. I'm a reverend. Dr. Goodman Black."<br/><br/>"Ah! I'm Dr. Orange!"<br/><br/>"How providential. Well, I have many talents, but I guess I can't resurrect this vehicle if you can't. My people can take public transport...I guess I'll have to hire a car."<br/><br/>"My friends are coming along, they can drive you back."<br/><br/>"If it's not any trouble. And I'd have to bring my men..."<br/><br/>"Oh, it's a big car."<br/><br/>They walked back to the studio and found Ruby and Geronimo leaning against their car. "Y'all were up in the studio," said Black.<br/><br/>"I was visiting my friend Max," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Ah, he's a good man. I just wish he'd hear the call. Still, he lets me get out the good word."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/> <br/>Escobar dropped in on Jimmy's holding cell. He stood watching him for a long moment, smoking down a cigarette. "You know, you make a big deal out of how you're Jimmy Wright, an honest man. But the first little sign of trouble and what do you do? Lean on your friends. I don't need this kind of trouble. They don't pay me enough."<br/><br/>He unlocked the cell. "Go home, Mr. Wright."<br/><br/>"No handshake?"<br/><br/>"Get the hell out of my station."<br/><br/>Jimmy sauntered out of the front door of the police station and walked briskly for a few blocks before almost collapsing against the wall of an apartment building. He hailed a cab, wincing as he raised his arm, and took it back to the office.<br/><br/>He found Millicent asleep on a couch. He was pulling up a blanket over her when she opened her eyes. "Mr. Wright! You're safe!"<br/><br/>"Yeah. I think maybe because of you."<br/><br/>"So I was right to call the station and tell them Senator Grey was expecting you tomorrow?"<br/><br/>"It got me out. Where's Ruby and Geronimo?"<br/><br/>"They went with Dr. Orange to the radio station."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>Geronimo drove into Echo Park. The Temple of Joy was on a hill, with several acres of grounds hidden behind a brick wall. Two tough-looking men were standing next to the front gate.<br/><br/>They drove up to the Temple itself. It was a large building with a silver-plated dome on top. Dr. Black stepped out of the car. "Well, thank you for the drive--"<br/><br/>"Oh, couldn't we stop in for a drink of water?" asked Ruby, smiling her most seductive grin.<br/><br/>"I...of course. We'll go in the servant's entrance," said Black, non-plussed. He opened a door on one wing of the building and led them into a large lounge. A bar took up most of one wall. Fresco paintings of saints and biblical scenes dominated the walls. For some reason, Ruby was unnerved by them--there was something wrong about their <i>mouths</i>, though she couldn't quite figure out what. There was also a faint--not <i>odor</i>, but <i>presence</i> of Nectar.<br/><br/>A great empty space loomed to one side--the sanctuary, dimly lit.<br/><br/>"Dr. Black," said Geronimo. "I admire your work here. As a man of God myself, I appreciate your difficulties. Our friend Dr. Orange is very interested in learning about your denomination. Do you think he might join your congregation?"<br/><br/>"Well, we recommend that people listen to the radio program or attend some services."<br/><br/>"He was hoping to come to the revival meeting."<br/><br/>"That's really supposed to be for our more...dedicated members."<br/><br/>"Dr. Black," said Ruby, "every year my family makes a donation to a charity. Perhaps your church could be the beneficiary this year?"<br/><br/>"I see. Let me get you our recommendation donation list," said Goodman Black.<br/><br/>Ruby paled slightly as she looked over the sheet Black handed her. "Well. A good thing I brought my checkbook."<br/><br/><i>[Two point Credit Rating spend by RP.]</i><br/><br/>When she had finished filling out the check and handed it--with some reluctance--to Black, he turned and put a hand on Dr. Orange's shoulder. "Now, I can't fully initiate you into our church in one night. This is a process that takes a great deal of time; one must make a vigil for an entire night, and it all must be approached in a spirit of absolute dedication and faith. But perhaps, if you wished to stay, I could perform a baptism on you tonight, and instruct you in a few of our rites."<br/><br/>"Yes," said Julius, nervously. "I'm sure my faith will carry me through."<br/><br/>"I'm sure it will," said Dr. Black, not at all ominously. "You can pick up your friend in the morning."<br/><br/><i>[I kinda botched this sequence a bit--and I've since notified everyone that I will be using the "Getting captured nets you information and a refresh" rules from </i>Night's Black Agents<i>. However, I was painted a bit in a corner here--the obvious thing to do would be to either shoot Dr. Orange and toss him in the basement, or give him Nectar and hook him on the drug. I did charge OP a point of Flattery to keep the first option off the table.</i><br/><br/><i>Still, it would have been better to go a bit more with the flow here than I did.]</i><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445338/#Comment_445338" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-25T15:51:37+00:00" title="May 25, 2015  3:51PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode III: What Kind Of Love Have You Got? (Part 7)</b><br/><br/>"So I think the plan is to lay in ambush near the Temple of Joy and then bust out the doctor," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Do you think that's necessary?" said Geronimo. "Maybe we should just find a hotel to lay low in."<br/><br/>"Let's call James," said Ruby, pulling over in front of a coffee shop. She ran inside, sat down in the phone booth, composed herself, and then dialed the number.<br/><br/>"Mr. Wright's office," said Millicent on the other end.<br/><br/>"I need to speak to James."<br/><br/>"He's a bit under the weather after his conversation with the LAPD."<br/><br/>"He's definitely going to want to hear this. We left Dr. Orange with possibly a cult."<br/><br/>Millicent repeated it back slowly. There was a spluttering noise in the back ground, and the sound of the receiver being snatched up.<br/><br/>"James, are you well?" asked Ruby.<br/><br/>"No. Yes. No. Where are you?"<br/><br/>"Near Echo Park. We met with Dr. Black and created a plan on the fly to have the professor stay overnight to be baptized."<br/><br/>"By himself?"<br/><br/>"Yes, and it cost me a great deal to get even that. We can talk about my expense account later."<br/><br/>"You are not breaking in there," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Well, that <i>was</i> my suggestion. But why don't you meet us here, we can have a little bit of dinner, and decide what to do."<br/><br/>"You left him without a weapon--tools--any way of calling for help...don't move. I'll be there in ten minutes."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>"Follow me, doc," said Goodman Black. He took Julius across the vast, shadowy vault of the sanctuary.<br/><br/>"Where are your Bibles?" asked Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"We don't leave them out. It's a neatness thing." Black led them into a vestibule, and beyond that into a large office. Bookcases full of old books dominated an entire wall. There was an expensive teak desk at the far end of the room, and beyond that a glass door leading into a conservatory area. There didn't seem to be many plants in it.<br/><br/>"This is my office," said Black. "We'll do the baptism here. I need you to put on this white robe--but you need to be wearing only this robe. Can't have any contamination from the outside world. It's symbolic of your transformation into a new being."<br/><br/>Black seemed to be without modesty; he quickly stripped off all his clothes and threw on a robe identical to the one he had given Julius except for a red oval-shaped symbol over the chest.<br/><br/>"Where's the water?" asked Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"We use the holy water of God. I don't need much for this. You might say I'm a bit of a fundamentalist like that." He ducked around a bookshelf and came back with two small vials of a honey-colored liquid. A strong mossy smell came from them, something that reminded Julius of something that he couldn't quite place.<br/><br/>"You might say this is a variation on the Eucharist and baptism in the same rite," said Black. "We will both drink of the holy water of God, and then be together in God."<br/><br/>"This all seems very Catholic!" said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"I assure you, this has nothing to do with Rome. Now, are you in or out? They said you were a man of God."<br/><br/>Julius looked down, abashed.<br/><br/>"Do you feel you're not ready to make this choice yet?" said Dr. Black. He threw an arm compassionately over Julius' shoulders.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445339/#Comment_445339" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-25T15:52:13+00:00" title="May 25, 2015  3:52PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode III: What Kind Of Love Have You Got? (Part 8)</b><br/><br/>"I don't see why we couldn't finish dinner," said Ruby as Jimmy's armored sedan sped toward the Temple of Joy.<br/><br/>"We have to get the doctor. Take that turn, Betty."<br/><br/>The car sped up a slight ridge and stopped. From this vantage point they could see the entire Temple grounds--and the flashlights of the patrols walking along the walls.<br/><br/>"Damnit," said Jimmy, fishing around for binoculars. "Wish I could see what they were armed with."<br/><br/>They sat for a long time, watching the house. "James," said Ruby, "I've been paying attention to the pattern here and I think I know when the best time to try and make our way to the Temple."<br/><br/>"Really?"<br/><br/>"Observation is part of this job, isn't it?"<br/><br/><i>[Shadowing test by RP.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>"I think I need some time to mull this over," said Julius. "I know your rite says that private meditation in the Sanctuary helps bring you closer to God."<br/><br/>Black took a long look at the vials, and then capped them. "I suppose we can give God fifteen minutes."<br/><br/>As they walked back into the Sanctuary, Dr. Orange could hear the faint sounds of people moving around in the floor above Black's office.<br/><br/><i>[OP made a spend from his 3-point "Stuff about the Temple of Joy" pool he got with his earlier Bureaucracy spend.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>Jimmy, Ruby, Millicent, and Geronimo ran up the hill towards the Temple. "Down!" hissed Jimmy, and the flashlight beams of a patrol swept just over their heads as they crouched on the ground.<br/><br/>"They're watching the gate more than anything else. Let's head for the conservatory," said Jimmy.<br/><br/><i>[Sense Trouble test by JP to find the best route. They made a Stealth test to get up the hill, rolled by GP with MP helping out--Jimmy and Ruby don't have any Stealth.]</i><br/><br/>They quickly forced the conservatory door and made their way into Black's office. Ruby's nose crinkled as the smell of Nectar hit her.<br/><br/>Jimmy looked around. "Oh boy. It's never good when they have this many books."<br/><br/>"I wonder what they're about?" whispered Millicent.<br/><br/>"You are not reading those, young lady."<br/><br/>Ruby gulped as Geronimo capped the vials and put them in the desk. "No, Miss Fitzgibbons."<br/><br/><i>[So, TN 5 Stability test to resist Nectar for RP, but then I kicked back a point of Stability because Ruby is clearly following her Adventure drive. At this point I hit Dr. Orange with a Soft Driver to try and get a better look at the books, but OP paid that off quickly.]</i><br/><br/>"Aren't those Dr. Orange's clothes?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"I think Dr. Black was wearing that suit," said Millicent, pointing at a different pile of clothes.<br/><br/>"We better get him," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Could I just grab something to read--" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"No!" hissed Jimmy and Geronimo at the same time.<br/><br/>They made their way to edge of the Sanctuary. Geronimo and Millicent crept into the shadows, slinking against opposite walls of the large room. Jimmy and Ruby stepped out into the middle of the room.<br/><br/>Goodman Black looked up. "What are you doing here?" He began edging towards one wall. Millicent could see a small handle on it, like a fire alarm.<br/><br/>Ruby jumped in his way. There was a flurry of hands, and then she had Black in an arm lock.<br/><br/>"Aaagh! Help, help!" shouted Black. Jimmy tried to clap a hand over his face, but the Reverend bit him.<br/><br/>Dr. Orange could hear the pounding of feet on stairs, coming up from some hidden basement. He sprinted toward the office.<br/><br/>Black punched Jimmy in the face and snapped out of Ruby's armlock. He and Jimmy spun around as two men in zoot suits carrying Thompsons burst out of doors on either side of the choir platform.<br/><br/>Millicent slid away from the wall, came up behind Black, and cracked him over the back of the head with her tennis racket. He stumbled but darted for a door on the side of the Sanctuary, disappearing from view.<br/><br/>Jimmy heard the distinctive sound of a Thompson being cocked. He and Ruby dropped to the ground as bullets smashed into the floor around them.<br/><br/>Geronimo stepped away from the wall, his big Russian 9mm barking as he shot at one of the thugs, who fell back behind the a pillar. Jimmy fired off a burst from his Army Colt, but the zoot suiter was too well-covered.<br/><br/>Ruby pulled her little pistol from her bag and fired some desperate shots off to try and cover Jimmy and Geronimo. Behind her the front doors opened. She cast a nervous glance back there to see Captain Walker and two of his guards step inside the Temple.<br/><br/>Walker calmly considered the scene in front of him. "<i>Matalos</i>," he said. His men leveled their Thompsons and fired several bursts into the room. Jimmy and Millicent found cover near the vestibule door, but were pinned down by the crossfire.<br/><br/><i>[Jimmy and Millicent both took some damage here, but not enough to go negative.]</i><br/><br/>Geronimo pulled something out of his pocket and skimmed it across the floor. "<i>Viva la Revolucion</i>," he said, running across the room, as the grenade rolled to a stop near Walker's feet.<br/><br/><i>[Preparedness roll by GP to have a grenade; the roll was a 6, which wasn't the TN, but then I realized it would be pretty cool for Geronimo to be carrying around a dud--after all, nobody else knows it doesn't work!]</i><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445359/#Comment_445359" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-26T19:20:32+00:00" title="May 26, 2015  7:20PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode III: What Kind Of Love Have You Got?

Geronimo fired a snapshot over his shoulder at one of the remaining zoot suiters. He slammed the door behind him just as one of them said, "It's a dud!"<br/><br/>After a moment there was a roar of automatic fire, and bullets ripped through the door to the office. "Up!" said Jimmy, pointing at a small circular wrought-iron staircase. Ruby, Millicent, and Geronimo clattered up it. <br/><br/>"Aren't you coming?" asked Geronimo.<br/><br/>"I'm getting our escape route!" said Jimmy, dashing out the conservatory door followed by Millicent. There were some bursts of gunfire from outside.<br/><br/>The remaining three found themselves in a sitting room. It had expensive but ill-treated furniture, mostly armchairs. On the floor were three or four couples, writhing in sexual heat.<br/><br/>"Strip!" said Ruby. "We have to blend in!"<br/><br/>They tore off their clothes. Ruby pulled Dr. Orange and Geronimo to her. "Make out with me!" she whispered to Geronimo.<br/><br/>Two gunmen and Walker came up the staircase. "We have the boss," said Walker in Spanish. "The intruders must have gone around. Find them!" <br/><br/>He turned to go. "These people disgust me. One of you stay here. I have to take care of the boss. He's hysterical."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>"Holy shit, Mr. J!" said Betty as Jimmy and Millicent limped up to the car. Jimmy pulled open the door and shoved Betty over while Millicent slipped into the back. Without a word, Jimmy yanked the car into gear and drove down the ridge.<br/><br/>"What are we doing, boss?" whispered Betty as he pulled the car in front of the gates to the Temple and stopped. One of the guards began to move toward the car, fishing into his coat.<br/><br/>Jimmy threw the car into reverse and backed down the street quickly. He jabbed at the clutch and the car burned rubber as it shot squealing toward the gates.<br/><br/>He was doing 40 when the car hit the gates, smashing them open. He hit 50 on the driveway as bullets rained down on the car, starring the windows. He grimaced as he pulled the emergency brake and fishtailed to a stop in front of the Temple.<br/><br/><i>[3 points of damage to Jimmy on the way up, which put him negative, but JP spent a point of health to, as I put it, make a Humphrey Bogart grimace while staying conscious.]</i><br/><br/>"That's our ride!" said Dr. Orange. As the man guarding them ran to the window to see what was happening outside, Geronimo stood up and gave him a sharp push through the open window.<br/><br/>Dr. Orange picked up their clothes. Ruby slipped up to a closed door on one side of the sitting room and opened it a crack. Inside was some kind of bedroom. The floor was undulating.<br/><br/>She looked closer. It was carpeted with writhing human bodies, engaged in every form of sexual congress imaginable. The heady scent of Nectar hit her like a physical blow.<br/><br/>"Come on!" hissed Geronimo. With a shudder, she slammed the door shut and dashed down the stairs.<br/><br/>As soon as Ruby and company were in the car, Betty clambered over Jimmy and sped down the driveway. Bullets rained down on all sides, but the armor held. They burst through the wrecked gates and quickly disappeared into the California night.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445360/#Comment_445360" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-26T19:21:05+00:00" title="May 26, 2015  7:21PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode III: What Kind Of Love Have You Got?

"Mr. Wright! What happened to you...oh, my God! My baby, what you do to her?"<br/><br/>"On the plus side, she performed beautifully," said Jimmy. "I'm going to need another car."<br/><br/>Arturo tossed him a set of keys. "Take the white one. I said it would be ready on Thursday, so bring it back by Thursday."<br/><br/>They drove down to Malibu. "I know a place where folks go to dry out," said Jimmy from the back seat. "One of those <i>rest homes</i>."<br/><br/>"Palm Cove?" asked Ruby.<br/><br/>"Yeah."<br/><br/>"That's one of the better ones. I've always enjoyed my stays there."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>Palm Cove was a rather anonymous little place near the beach. The paint was fading, and the furniture in the rooms was at least ten years out of fashion. It had an air not of lost hope, but <i>exhausted</i> hope; the desperation of the soon-to-be-relapsed. Still, they had an examining room that was clean enough for Geronimo to cut the bullet out of Jimmy's shoulder, and the place was out of the way enough for them to lay low and heal up.<br/><br/>Dr. Orange, who had managed to escape the mansion unscathed, spent most of his days sitting and watching the waves roll in, trying to make sense of his experiences in the Temple, the strangely familiar and enticing odor of Nectar that he couldn\u2019t seem to get out of his nose. He watched the waves roll in and thought of oscillation patterns, of the subtle gravitic ballet between the Moon, the Earth, and the water. <br/><br/>Ruby called Captain Murphy.<br/><br/>"I hear this place doesn't have any booze," he said when he arrived. "So have some pills."<br/><br/>"What are they?" asked Ruby.<br/><br/>"Damned if I know!"<br/><br/>Millicent spent some time going through the books they had rescued from the Temple of Joy. She'd already read the <i>Malleus Maleficorum</i>, of course, but the <i>Pnakoptic Manuscripts</i> was very interesting. And then she found a diagram of the Los Angeles County water system.

Jimmy wasted no time calling him.<br/><br/>"You want to speak to me?" he said when Black picked up.<br/><br/>"I do. Shall we say neutral ground? Union Station."<br/><br/>"Tomorrow. Two o'clock." Jimmy hung up and rang Senator Grey's office. <br/><br/>"What can I do for you, Jimmy? Another schoolgirl in a hospital?"<br/><br/>"I may have found a plot to contaminate the city water supply with an extremely powerful drug."<br/><br/>"What is this, a dime novel?"<br/><br/>"Just giving you a heads up."<br/><br/>"Do you have any evidence?"<br/><br/>"When have I ever worked with evidence?"<br/><br/>"Bring me something solid, and I'll talk to the governor. But not before. And thanks for making my day more complicated--I've never regretted that first time I hired you," said Grey right before hanging up.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>"Lot of cops," said Jimmy as he, Dr. Orange, and Geronimo arrived at Union Station. The police had cordoned off a section with Goodman Black standing in the middle of it.<br/><br/>"I have to say," said Black as they came up, "it was a little rude, coming to my place under false pretenses and planting your little monkey there."<br/><br/>"The doctor wasn't my idea," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"I've been completely honest with <i>you</i>," said Black. "All I want to do is bring the love of God to the world."<br/><br/>"The wrong god, I think."<br/><br/>"Oh no, this is the right god. I am absolutely sure. I've talked to him. You can too."<br/><br/>"I decided a while ago I don't want to talk to a god who talks back."<br/><br/>"But he's real, Jimmy! He wants to talk to you. Especially you. But I want to invite all of you to come speak to him."<br/><br/>"Does he have a name?"<br/><br/>"He does, but I'm not sure I should say it in public. As you know, my real name is Samson Trammel," said Black smoothly. <br/><br/>Jimmy grunted.<br/><br/>"I took this name when I became a preacher.  Because I work for the good Black Man."<br/><br/>"Funny. I still have his card."<br/><br/>"You should call him then. Now, I want you to know that I don't have any hard feelings about what you did, although it was unkind. And I will leave you alone, if you let me alone. But come at me again--well, where I'm from? Texas? We can forgive a mistake like this once. The second time we gotta put you in the ground."<br/><br/>"Your boss can talk to me whether I want to or not."<br/><br/>"He's good at talking."<br/><br/>"Hasn't he always been?"<br/><br/>"I don't know what he was like before," said Black philosophically. "I only know what he's like now. Doc, the offer still is open to come get baptized."<br/><br/>"I saw what that means," said Dr. Orange. <br/><br/>"I can show you <i>incontrovertible</i> proof of intelligences greater than our own."<br/><br/>"I...can't trust you."<br/><br/>"Shame. That's the kind of thing you get Nobels for. Mr. Cuevas, it was a brother, wasn't it? It's trivial for my Lord to bring him back to you. You could talk to him again."<br/><br/>"I talk to my brother whenever I want to," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Yes, but this time he could talk back."<br/><br/>"I know what he would say, especially about this."<br/><br/>"It's so sad.

Or could it be Echevarria, brought back to life?"<br/><br/>She picked up the picture of Richard Spend and stared at it for a long time. "He was from Texas..." she said. <br/><br/>She looked at the picture of Goodman Black she'd gotten at KLAX.<br/><br/>"No...oh, of course. He lost a lot of weight...but it's him.

"Now I'm going to have to hurt you all. That's the path you chose. We all have the choice between the path of God and the path of perdition."<br/><br/>He turned to go, but paused. "Oh, how's your friend Janet?" he called over his shoulder. "I'll see you soon, Jimmy."<br/><br/>Jimmy waited until the cops had left with Dr. Black and then raced for the car. They drove to Janet's building.<br/><br/>The door to her apartment had been kicked in, and the rooms thoroughly searched. There was no sign of Janet anywhere.<br/><br/>Without a word Jimmy stepped out of the house, hailed a cab, and vanished.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>Millicent took Vanessa for a walk under the boardwalk at Santa Monica.

She was working as a maid in an expensive house in Beverly Hills.<br/><br/>Her room was simple--a cross nailed to one wall, a calendar, and a very expensive cabinet radio.<br/><br/>"Who are you all?" she asked as Ruby, Geronimo and Dr. Orange came in the door. Her voice had a heavy Texas accent.<br/><br/>"We're private investigators," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"I already told the police that I didn't steal those spoons at my last job. It was a miscarriage of justice."<br/><br/>"What are you listening to?" asked Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"Music, and during the day when I can I listen to my stories."<br/><br/>"We're looking into an old case," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Oh, like those fellas who came looking for Ricky all them years ago? They said they was cops but they were PIs. I don't like PIs."<br/><br/>"Well, that's just it. We're looking in to them, and we were hoping you could shed some light on what they were asking about, and maybe why they were interested in your brother."<br/><br/>"Ricky's dead," Laura said quickly. "And you're as nosy as they were! Especially that Georgian son of a bitch."<br/><br/><i>Doug</i>, thought Ruby. Laura described the other man who had visited her ten years ago, and Ruby recognized the description of Vince Stack.<br/><br/>"Ricky," said Laura, shaking her head. "He was always getting in trouble. We came from nothing out in West Texas. Ricky did a bunch of things, roughnecking, worked a Gulf fishing boat. He was always pretty, though. Everyone always said he got all the looks in the family."<br/><br/>"We both know that's not true," purred Ruby.<br/><br/><i>[Flattery use by RP.]</i><br/><br/>"Sugar just won't melt in your mouth," said Laura. "Come about 1920 we were in California picking fruit. Ricky met one of them producer fellas and he got hired to be an actor. Of course, a lot of them weren't hardly Christian pictures--Ricky had a face for that kind of work. That's probably what got him into that other crowd and that damn Mexican. Looked high-class but he was slimy inside. Ricky tried to bring me to those parties but I wouldn't go, they used drugs like mary-juwanna."<br/><br/>"Anyone try to contact you since your brother died?"<br/><br/>"Just the cops."<br/><br/>"Did he leave you anything? Books?"<br/><br/>"Nope. He didn't even have no money, and no friends left."<br/><br/>"This is an excellent radio," said Dr. Orange, fiddling with the console.<br/><br/>"Don't mess that up," said Laura. "I listen to a Gospel program at six. Probably not your religion, I'm sure you wouldn't be interested."<br/><br/>"Oh, that must be that Goodman Black," said Ruby. "I happened to meet him a month ago."<br/><br/>"I ain't had the pleasure. Though I sure would like to."<br/><br/>"Oh, I have his picture here. He signed it."<br/><br/>Laura took the picture with trembling hands. A look of tenderness crept briefly over her face. "Sure is a handsome man," she whispered.<br/><br/>"You know," said Ruby deliberately, "I find myself with a vacancy on my staff. Would you be interested in a position? I could make it worth your while." She whispered a number in Laura's ear.<br/><br/>"That much?

"Then we can negotiate passage on an ocean-going freighter."<br/><br/>"But I've got a job in Pasadena, working for Dr. Orange," said Millicent, struggling to keep up.<br/><br/>"You can't go back to a job! Or school!"<br/><br/>"But Professor Fauche is expecting me to be his assistant--"<br/><br/>"Well, you can forget about that!"<br/><br/>They hailed a cab. "Let's go to Orange County," suggested Millicent.<br/><br/>"Good idea! We can work our way down to Mexico! People vanish for <i>years</i> in Mexico."<br/><br/>They stopped for the night in Huntington Beach, at a fleabag hotel near the beach. The sound of oil derricks droned through the night, and noxious oil fumes rolled in with the fog. Millicent waited for Vanessa to fall asleep (it didn't take long--she was clearly in a state of nervous exhaustion) and then called Erica Carlyle Grey.<br/><br/>"Wait, why are you with Vanessa?" she said over the phone.<br/><br/>"She decided the thing to do was to run to Mexico--"<br/><br/>"Oh, Christ, not again. I'll call some of Bradley's men."<br/><br/>"She's fine, she's just had a shock."<br/><br/>Not long after, a car pulled up with a couple of burly orderlies and a psychiatric nurse. By the time they dragged Vanessa out of the room, she was screaming, but they quickly sedated her.<br/><br/>"For your trip back," said one of the orderlies, handing Millicent a sawback. "And you didn't see nothing."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>"Home sweet home," said Ruby as they pulled up to her Beverly Hills house.<br/><br/>It was evening, and smog was roiling through the heavy air. Dr. Orange felt nervous. There was a foreboding feeling looming over the house. "Something's not right," he said, remembering ambushes in Berlin. "It feels like nobody's here."<br/><br/>They took a walk around the grounds. The guest cottage was empty, as they expected. But they found a basement window that had been smashed in.<br/><br/>"This is my house," snarled Ruby, pulling her gun out of her purse. "Let's find out what's going on."<br/><br/>They came in through the front door and began searching the house. Nobody was home, not even Althea the maid. They swept the first floor and then went into the basement.<br/><br/>It was clear that somebody had come in through the broken window. They checked each of the servant's rooms. Luz's room contained only the stench of Carmen's perfume. Althea's room showed signs that her belongings had been hastily packed.<br/><br/>In Geronimo's room they found a man, unconscious and curled up on the bed. <br/><br/>"Why do bums always chose my room?" grumbled Geronimo.<br/><br/>Ruby prodded him awake with her gun.<br/><br/>"Ah! Whaddaya doing, lady?" the man said, rolling over.<br/><br/>"Excuse me, you're in my home!"<br/><br/>"I'm sorry, lady, I didn't know. I just came her for the stuff."<br/><br/>"The what?"<br/><br/>"You know, the stuff."<br/><br/>"Do you mean the Renoir? You can have that beastly thing."<br/><br/>"What's a Renoir?"<br/><br/>Suddenly Ruby became aware of a familiar mossy smell. She slowly turned around.<br/><br/>Mouths erupted all along the walls. Horrible, lipless mouths with lolling tongues and jagged teeth. And from each dripped thick, gooey, disgusting, enticing, tempting Nectar.<br/><br/>Ruby shuddered and then emptied her clip a the mouths.<br/><br/>Geronimo rushed Ruby and pushed her out of the room. Dr. Orange grabbed the stranger and pulled him out of the room. Geronimo kicked the door shut.<br/><br/>"I'm having a bad day," said Ruby, slumping against the wall.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>The interrogated the bum in the guest cottage.<br/><br/>"Not as good as the real stuff," sighed the man.<br/><br/>"Do you know how this happened to my wall?" asked Ruby.<br/><br/>"Nope, just glad it did. Anyway, posh neighborhood like this you're bound to find somebody with Nectar. Just lucky I found your place. But it's not like the Bangkok Nectar. What a kick! You took it and felt so <i>alive</i>. You just had to go in there and tear somebody's head off! Hand to hand. Nothing like it."<br/><br/>Ruby noticed for the first time that the man's hands were knobby and calloused. His nose looked like it had been broken several times, and he limped when he walked.<br/><br/>"Lee Dempson," the man said, holding out his hand.<br/><br/>"Ruby."<br/><br/>"Right, this is your place. Sorry about your window."<br/><br/>"Charmed," said Ruby. "How long have you been scavenging like this?"<br/><br/>"I buy it when I have money, from those zoot suit guys. And...the parties up at the Temple. They're only supposed to allow in a fancy crowd. But truth is, if you look like you don't have any place to go, his men might bring you up there. And if you're lucky, they give you the stuff. Of course, you gotta do some pretty crazy things, but while you're on Nectar you don't care any."<br/><br/>"Where'd you go in Bangkok?"<br/><br/>"There's a honey store. The Fragrant Honey Store.

(Part 15)</b><br/><br/>Millicent took a car back to Jimmy's office. She set herself to the job of reorganizing the files Ruby had misplaced. If she decided to also look up some of Jimmy's files on Egypt, well, nobody would need to know, and they weren't locked in any <i>serious</i> way. Well, the safe was kind of hard,  but she\u2019d broken more difficult setups before.<br/><br/>About Egypt, she only found some summaries--Jimmy had never been there. But she found references, mostly from a Freddie Blakely, to Omar Shakhti--some sort of sorcerer--and a woman named Hypatia.<br/><br/>There was also a box labeled Jack Brady. With trembling hands she opened it and began to flip through the contents.<br/><br/>There was a letter, with the name <i>Mirabelle</i> written on it. Millicent opened it and a single sheet of paper and a photograph fell out.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><i>To my Darling Mirabelle on her 16th Birthday</i><br/><br/><i>Dearest, nothing I can write here can possibly make up for all the years I missed. I wish I could explain to you why I had to leave you like this. I guess it's just that I made a lot of mistakes in my life and I had to take any chance I could get to put some of them right.</i><br/><br/><i>I wish I could see the beautiful woman you've grown up to be. I know you've been taking good care of your mom, and Jimmy and Freddie promised to help her out.</i><br/><br/><i>I don't have anything to give you as a present except my necklace. It's saved my life many times even thought I never really understood it. My mother gave it to me a long time ago. Maybe if we ever knew how to use it, our family forgot over time. Still, it's why they used to call me "Brass" -- well, one reason at least.</i><br/><br/><i>I will warn you about the necklace. It has a terrible and dreadful purpose, and using it can make you empty. Perhaps there's a safe way to use it. Or maybe you have to be the right kind of person. I don't know.</i><br/><br/><i>But somehow I know you'll master it.</i><br/><br/><i>I'm enclosing my favorite photo of us, from your birthday when I gave you that doll carriage. I hope you took it with you.</i><br/><br/><i>It looks like we're going to start now. Francis wants me in the boat with him and we have a long way to go into darkness.

It showed a picture of a skinny, wiry man in a peaked cap and a pudgy girl in pigtails standing next to a doll carriage.<br/><br/>She remembered the doll carriage. She even, vaguely, remembered that day in Singapore, one of the few times Uncle Jack had stayed with them all night.<br/><br/>That is not what made her cry, what caused the room to spin until mercifully she fell back to the floor and into darkness.<br/><br/>The face of the little girl was not her face. <i>Not her face</i>.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445397/#Comment_445397" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-29T03:02:05+00:00" title="May 29, 2015  3:02AM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that was creepy.<br/><br/>I'd note that the bit in the school infirmary was Millicent having NO points of reassurance, first making folks feel bad at forgetting she was an orphan and than scaring them by mentioning her connection with the senator, all while trying to be reassuring.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445452/#Comment_445452" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-01T14:32:32+00:00" title="June  1, 2015  2:32PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm way behind on writeups, I know--we just put Session 7 in the books, although I should have the Episode IV writeup ready shortly.

(Part 16)</b><br/><br/>Sitting around the kitchen table in the guest cottage, Ruby, Dr. Orange, and Geronimo began to formulate a plan.<br/><br/>"We should blow up the temple," said Julius. "I can rig up a bomb. Unless you have a general who owes you a favor."<br/><br/>"I know some people wouldn't mind a bombing run on Echo Park," mused Ruby.<br/><br/>"I can get myself inside," said Geronimo. "I'll pretend to be a vagrant, and make trouble."<br/><br/>"They have a groundskeeping crew," said Dr. Orange. "My research with at the FBI office must have their name. A little pressure and I can get in on their crew and I can bring a bomb in that way. A big bomb. It's amazing what's legal in America, in Germany..."<br/><br/>"Yes, yes," said Ruby. "And I have a plane. Not the Lockheed. My biplane."<br/><br/>"Are you joking?" said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"No. And I know a guy with some fireworks. I guess Julius had the right idea."<br/><br/>They made plans for the next day. Geronimo decided to go and have another Mass said in his brother's memory. Dr. Orange called up Dr. Born for a round of golf. Ruby spent a long time staring at her grandmother's cameo.<br/><br/><i>[More Stability refresh scenes!]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>Ruby dropped by Jimmy's office the next afternoon. She found Millicent sitting on the floor, surrounded by open folders and sheets of paper. An open safe behind her had the distinct appearance of something that should be closed.<br/><br/>"My brain hurts," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"What--" said Ruby, stunned.<br/><br/>"I was looking for clues," said Millicent miserably.<br/><br/>"There there, dear," said Ruby, guiding Millicent to the couch. "Have a drink. What's the matter?"<br/><br/>"I don't know!" said Millicent, sobbing into Ruby's blouse. She cried for a long time but somehow found Ruby's presence comforting.<br/><br/><i>[Psychological triage by RP!]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/> <br/>Geronimo went to a corner Lee had recommended. After a long wait, a panel truck pulled up and a man in a zoot suit jumped out the back.<br/><br/>"I need five," he said. "You. You two. You. And...you."<br/><br/>Geronimo shuffled up into the back of the truck. "You got a sandwich?" he said to the main in the zoot suit.<br/><br/>"You'll get everything you need when we get to the place," said the man with smirk as he slammed the rear doors shut.<br/><br/>One rather forlorn man slumped down in a corner and shook his head. "You boys are really in for a bad time," he said. "and a good time too. I guess you can see I have mixed feelings about this. Man, I wish my university hadn't gone under in the Crash."<br/><br/>"What will happen when we get there?" asked Geronimo.<br/><br/>"They'll pen us up for a while, waiting for the party to really get started. Then they'll give us this drug. After that, you'll probably do some debauchery with some rich white ladies. Ladies if you're lucky, that is. Or they'll take you down to the basement."<br/><br/>"What's there?"<br/><br/>"There's one room for recreation, so they like to keep people there. But there's another room. I ain't never gone in there. Lucky. Nobody who goes in there comes back out. At least, not sane."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>They reached the Temple of Joy. At least, Geronimo thought it was the Temple--they herded everyone quickly across the lawn and down into the basement. Some of Walker's men made them strip and then hosed them down with frigid water. They gave them soup and bread to eat.<br/><br/>"They don't want you to be hungry," said the talkative man. "You might try and eat an ear or something. Don't worry, this isn't <i>that</i> room in the basement. We're next to the wine cellar. Guys come down sometimes to fetch bottles."<br/><br/>They settle down to wait. Geronimo fell into a relaxed tension. Right before he sensed the basement door open, he sprinted for the wine cellar, jimmied the door, and slipped inside.<br/><br/>Through the door he heard the angry barks of Walker's men as they herded the vagrants upstairs. He sighed and relaxed for a moment.<br/><br/>The door to the wine closet opened and a waiter came in. "God, who drinks so much merlot?" he muttered, before stopping dead in his tracks. He stared at the angry, naked, heavily scarred man in front of him.<br/><br/>Geronimo grabbed a bottle of wine and began to swing.<br/><br/>"Not the Lafitte!" said the man.<br/><br/>Geronimo shrugged, grabbed another bottle, and decked the waiter.<br/><br/>As he was shrugging into the other man's clothes, Geronimo heard a faint sound of music coming from behind one of the wine racks. He poked around until he found a small latch.<br/><br/>The rack swung away from the wall. There was a room beyond it.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445455/#Comment_445455" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-01T14:35:08+00:00" title="June  1, 2015  2:35PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode III: What Kind Of Love Have You Got?

He hefted his large truck spanner--the same one he had used to disable the groundskeeper's truck--and made his way silently into Goodman Black's office.<br/><br/>He sighed as he walked past the bookshelves full of exotic volumes. And then he flattened himself against the wall.<br/><br/>Somebody was standing near the doorway.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>The music was louder now that the wine rack had opened. It was strange. It sounded vaguely Mexican, but with Indian themes worked in, combined with harsh atonal dissonances. A low backing track that sounded like it could be played by a mariachi combo added it's own discordant tones. Over it was a low chanting, a woman's voice.<br/><br/>The smell of Nectar hit him like a physical blow and he almost staggered from it. As his gaze dropped, he saw a writhing mass of human bodies, more debauched than anything he had ever seen Nectar addicts doing. They almost <i>pulsed</i>, in some alien motion. As he watched, a gigantic <i>tongue</i> rose from the center of the floor. It was longer than an elephant's trunk and thicker than a man's leg. It arced over and began licking the bodies close to it. Hands reached for it. Arms embraced it. Mouths closed on it in horrid kisses.<br/><br/>And from it dripped vast amounts of orange, gooey Nectar.<br/><br/><i>[Bang! That was a 6-point Stability loss for Geronimo. That's worse than coming across a battlefield.]</i><br/><br/>Geronimo tossed the naked waiter into the room, and slammed shut the wine rack.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>There was an enormous crowd of the faithful gathered in the Sanctuary. In his waiter disguise, Geronimo had no problem making his way across the floor and into the vestibule outside Goodman Black's office.<br/><br/>Behind him, in the Sanctuary, he heard Black's voice rising. "Tonight is the <i>night</i>, brothers and sisters!"<br/><br/>Geronimo took out a pocket knife he'd found in the waiter's pocket and jimmied the door. Behind it was a zoot suited guard with a Thompson.<br/><br/>"What the hell?" said the guard.<br/><br/>"Oh, Joe the cook sent me--"<br/><br/>"The cook's name isn't Joe! I have to call this in--"<br/><br/>Geronimo swung his tray at the guard's face.<br/><br/>The man stumbled back. He cocked his gun--<br/><br/>Dr. Orange smacked him the back of the head with his spanner.<br/><br/><i>[OP: I want to hit him from behind.<br/>Me: Okay, sure, you can attack.<br/>OP: Do I need to even roll?

He swung the tray again, edge first, into the guard's throat. Something cracked and the guard dropped to the ground.<br/><br/>"Come on, Doctor.

The crowd had fallen eerily silent, and a procession of young boys and girls were filing into the middle of the room. The boys wore handsome white suits, and the girls pretty white pinafores. Both had crowns of flowers on their heads.<br/><br/>Geronimo looked at the floor in the center of the Sanctuary. He thought for a moment. The pit in the basement was directly beneath it.<br/><br/>There were hinges mounted in the floor.<br/><br/>He raised the Thompson he had taken from the guard. With an angry growl, he pulled the trigger and hosed fire at Samson Trammel. People shrieked and fell to the floor, crawling away from the noise. Bullets smacked into Trammel's chest. He jerked back and fell to the floor, bleeding heavily, and crawled towards the back of the room.<br/><br/><i>[This was a hard driver against Geronimo's Duty drive.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>Suddenly there were bursts of white light from outside. Firework starburst shells were raining down onto the lawn.<br/><br/>Dr. Orange paused in his search of Trammel's desk. "Ruby's here!" he said. He jammed a crowbar in a drawer and pulled it open.<br/><br/>At the bottom of it, wrapped in a dirty white rag, he found a roughly bound book, caked and stained with organic fluids. He opened the cover and found a handwritten title page:<br/><br/><i>The Testament of Dripping Mouthes Emanates</i><br/><br/><i>by Samson Trammel, DD, Savior of Mankind</i><br/><i>and chosen one of the True God</i><br/><br/>Inside the book were bizarre and cryptic notes, poems, fragments of musical notation, and sketches. There were several full-color paintings done in different styles, depicting various female figures. Dr. Orange suspected they were intended as allegories of goddesses.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>"Drop another one!" said Ruby to Millicent as she circled the plane around for another pass.<br/><br/>As she swung over the gate, she saw a panel truck smash into the gate. "Murphy's here!" shouted Millicent.<br/><br/>"Ten minutes late," said Ruby. "That's practically on time for him!"<br/><br/>As the truck roared up the drive, Millicent could see Captain Walker and several of his men rushing towards the front door of the Temple. She flung another fireworks shell out of the plane, aiming for the center of the group of men. It hit the ground with a shriek and a shower of stars, and two of the men fell down.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445479/#Comment_445479" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-02T16:52:31+00:00" title="June  2, 2015  4:52PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode III: What Kind Of Love Have You Got?

He felt a stinging pain in his leg and then something slammed into his back, knocking him down. For a moment the room dimmed, but he was able to crawl forward towards the vestibule. He left a trail of blood behind him.<br/><br/>"This ends tonight," shouted Walker. "I'm not going to let you kill all these kids! This has gone too far!"<br/><br/>He turned to his men. "Get the kids out of here. Kill the rest."<br/><br/>Dr. Orange pulled Geronimo into the office, and slung him over his shoulders in an awkward fireman's carry. He stumbled out onto the lawn just as a panel truck pulled up to the house. Captain Murphy and several of his crewmembers jumped out of the truck.<br/><br/>"Ruby sent us to grab the books!" barked Murphy. "Looks like it's going to be a fight! Charlie, Raekwon, get in there with your rifles! The rest of you start fetching books."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>Inside the sanctuary, there was a terrific rattle of gunfire as Walker's men began gunning down the congregation. Charlie, a gigantic man with a Maori tattoo covering half his face, was gently rounding up the children and herding them through Trammel's office and outside. Murphy helped lift them up into the back of the truck.<br/><br/>"Getting a bit hot here, doc!" he said to Julius. "Should we stay or go? You got any business left?"<br/><br/>"Damnit, there's a woman! Janet might be there!"<br/><br/>"I respect that, Doc!"<br/><br/>Dr. Orange ran inside the office, holding Geronimo's Thompson gun. He heard a grinding noise from the Sanctuary, and hazarded a look into it for a second. The floor was collapsing, and congregants and Walker's men alike were sliding into a pit.<br/><br/>He ran up the iron staircase and into Trammel's sitting room. "Janet! Janet!" he shouted. He tried to push around some of the bodies, but he didn't see her anywhere. The building began to shake.<br/><br/>He half-ran, half-slid down the staircase into the office. The interior walls between the office and the Sanctuary were beginning to collapse. <br/><br/>He saw a gigantic tongue rise up out of the pit in the center of the room. He shrieked and fired off the rest of the clip from his gun before running in utter terror to Murphy's truck.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>Millicent lobbed a starburst shell into the cupola on top of the dome.

"They seem to be all out of there."<br/><br/>"How can you know that for sure! I'm not throwing anymore of these things!"<br/><br/>Ruby shrugged and put the plane into an aileron roll.

Or a vet?"<br/><br/>Geronimo groaned.<br/><br/>"Just take us back to that clinic," said Dr. Orange, slumping down next to a crate.

(Part 20)</b><br/><br/>They managed to wake up the doctor who signed all the prescriptions at Palm Cove. Somehow he managed to pull the bullets out of Geronimo's chest and leg without killing the Spaniard. They found an out of the way bungalow to hide him in while he recuperated. <br/><br/>Ruby began the long process of sorting through the captured books. She spent several days going over the <i>Testament</i> in particular.<br/><br/> And then she spent several days trying to shake off the effects. Eventually she was recovered enough to report back to the others.<br/><br/><i>[Even with clawing back some Stability for following her drive--dropping bombs from a plane and reading this book are both Adventurous--Ruby still got blasted by the 5 points of Stability she lost reading the book and so her Sanity went down by one.]</i><br/><br/>The book was filled with Kabbalistic imagery, especially of the Tree of Life--the arrangement of the ten Sephiroth familiar to most occultists. Disturbingly, however, most of the references were <i>Qliphothic</i>--the inverses of the Sephiroth, the dark demons of matter and fear.<br/><br/>One painting in the book was called <i>The Allegorical Marriage of Sophia</i> and was filled with references to the Sephiroth and the Tree of Life. It showed a man and a beautiful woman kissing, but Ruby couldn't puzzle much more out.<br/><br/>"The Cult back in 1926 thought that they were worshiping Gol-Goroth. Echevarria, however, didn't," said Ruby in between sips of a massive tropical cocktail. "Our friend Richard Spend wasn't in the inner circle back then, but he's pieced a lot together, mostly by buying Echevarria's library."<br/><br/>"And now we have it," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"Precisely. Trammel, as it turns out, thinks that the creature that Echevarria worshiped is called Nyarlathotep. Also known as the Black Pharoah. Some say he was identified with the vulture-headed god Thoth. Supposedly he gave the evil queen Nitocris her dark power. Also, he may be the Black Man that the witch cults of Europe made compacts with."<br/><br/>Everyone stared at Ruby.<br/><br/>"I didn't recognize the name, so I looked it up in some of the other books we got. Very interesting stuff."<br/><br/><i>[The Testament, strangely enough, doesn't grant any points in Cthulhu Mythos. (As MP put it, it's basically a giant core clue.) I offered RP a point of CM provided Ruby spent time correlating material in the other books.]</i><br/><br/>"Anyway, they say he's the God With a Thousand Masks. All sorts of forms and traditions of worship--there are African forms, Chinese forms...and others."<br/><br/>Millicent gulped. That reminded her of some of the files she had found in Jimmy's safe, including a few that were barely coherent and seemed to involve something he had <i>personally witnessed</i>.<br/><br/>"There's also several letters to an 'SS' who were debating the nature of the being they worshiped. She--it seems likely she's female, and her writing reminds me of some of the things Andre said in English, so she probably knows French. But given that the letters are from Bangkok, she's probably not French. She's invited 'Goodman Black' to come and visit her to 'fight in our rites in Bangkok.' It matches what that bum told us about the fights."<br/><br/>Ruby showed some copies of the other letters she'd found. "This is from 'Montgomery Donovan' in Malta, about <i>increasing the yield of the Mouth</i>. Black tried all sorts of different things, but Donovan said that a proper sacrifice could do the trick. Black was skeptical...but then he was going to kill all those kids. Donovan said that his production went waaay up a couple of months ago."<br/><br/>"That can't work. Ridiculous. No basis," said Dr. Orange. "It's not science. Magic."<br/><br/>"There's something from Luz Discos in Mexico City, talking about ways to use the 'song of the Mouth.' Some stuff from a 'JB' about <i>our next recording and the results it will obtain</i>. For what it's worth, Trammel doesn't seem to think much of him. JB is also interested in figuring out who they're worshiping. He tends to talk about <i>your god</i> and <i>our god</i> when he writes Trammel. So, we've got three people and two of them think Trammel is wrong."<br/><br/>"It doesn't matter," said Millicent. "It's not real. They've got some kind of chemical lab. Right, doctor?"<br/><br/>"<i>Ja</i>, labs," said Julius, staring into space.<br/><br/>"Anything in the papers about our little events?" asked Ruby.<br/><br/>"Just that there was a fire, probably caused by a fireworks show that was interrupted by a a gangland attack," said Gernoimo. "Hundreds dead. But not the Reverand Doctor, it seems. He's recovering nicely at Mt. Sinai Hospital.<br/><br/>"We should pay him a visit," said Dr. Orange.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445618/#Comment_445618" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-11T16:12:40+00:00" title="June 11, 2015  4:12PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode IV: Why Do We Give Our Love to the Past (Part 1)</b><br/><br/><i>[Editorial note: this will be a bit shorter than other episodes, mostly because we started the Mexico City section at the end of the session; I'm moving that part to the Episode V writeup, where it will be more logical.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy wasted no time trying to pick up Janet\u2019s trail. Her friends at the <i>Mirror</i> told him that she had been tipped off about Senator Clark, one of LA's fine representatives to the state legislature, being on the take. She'd headed up to Sacramento, and then out to Monterey where the Senator kept a beach home.<br/><br/>The sleepy streets of Monterey, bathed in fog at dawn and dusk, were a sharp contrast to the shadows and filth of LA, but they contained their own secrets. Jimmy slammed into the local underworld, paying when he could, cracking heads when he couldn't. He found out that Mrs. Senator Clark was a Nectar addict, currently drying out in Nevada. It didn't take too much deduction to figure out that the Senator was probably on the honey train himself--and that maybe Janet had been sent into a trap by Walker.<br/><br/>One night, while he was polishing off the rest of a bottle of rye in his dive of a hotel, he got a call from a woman with a thick Southern accent.<br/><br/>"Hello, Bethany," he said.<br/><br/>"You want to go to Sausalito. 23 Half Moon Street."<br/><br/>"Why are you telling me this?"<br/><br/>"Because we look after women like her. And because our goals are not directly opposed in this instance."<br/><br/>"Here's to staying on the same track as long as possible."<br/><br/>He drove up to Sausalito the next morning, taking the ferry over to the town. The almost-finished Golden Gate Bridge loomed above him in the fog as the ferry passed by the channel. 23 Half Moon Street turned out to be a run-down two story clapboard house badly in need of paint. Two tough looking Mexicans were sitting on the porch, eyeing everyone who came down the road.<br/><br/>That night he put in a call to Geronimo, while he settled in to watch the house.<br/><br/><i>[JP made a Shadowing check here to get a 2-point "messing up their stuff" pool.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Back in LA, Millicent sent Samson Trammel some flowers "from Senator Grey." She got a nice note back inviting the Senator to show up whenever he wanted. <i>Or his personal secretary</i>, she thought, and picked out her least-threatening outfit.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>"Let's try to sneak up on them and knock them out," said Jimmy. He, Dr. Orange, and Geronimo were watching the two Mexican guards, who were standing near the gate of the picket fence that surrounded the house.<br/><br/>"This will be easy," said Dr. Orange. "Even if we screw up we'll still murder them."<br/><br/>"Let's try to avoid that," sighed Jimmy.<br/><br/>Dr. Orange shrugged into the beat up overcoat he had bought from a bum that morning, and swung out into Half Moon Street. He lurched up to the two guards.<br/><br/>"Yeeegutta annythin' tdrnk?" he slurred. One of the guards burst out laughing, but stopped when his companion glared at him. Out of the corner of his eye, Dr. Orange could see Jimmy and Geronimo creeping up from opposite directions.<br/><br/>The laughing guard turned around just in time to see Geronimo raise his blackjack. He stepped back, slipping on brass knuckles, and threw a punch at Geronimo. The Spaniard blocked the blow at the last second and smashed a knee into the other man's stomach.<br/><br/>The other guard spun around and saw Jimmy swinging a cop's nightstick at his head. The blow connected hard and the guard went down like Joe Louis against Max Schmeling. <br/><br/>Dr. Orange swung at the man fighting Geronimo, but he dodged out of the way at the last minute--right into the butt of Geronimo's gun. There was a cracking noise and blood spurted from his nose as he fell to the ground, stunned.<br/><br/>Jimmy rushed up the porch and kicked the door open, followed by Dr. Orange, guns out. Geronimo swung around the back of the house to force the kitchen door.<br/><br/>From the back of the house came a man in a zoot suit, pushing Janet Rogers in front of him. He had an ugly looking .45 pressed to her head. "All right, se\xf1ores, nobody move and the pretty lady doesn't have to die."<br/><br/>Dr. Orange shot him in the head.<br/><br/>"Goddamnit!" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"It wasn't like he'd get a shot off," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>Janet, her face covered with blood and brains, fainted and began to fall back--into the arms of Geronimo, who was coming in from the kitchen.<br/><br/>"Don't do that ever again!" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"We should make our departure," said Geronimo. "The police will soon be here."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Millicent arrived at Mt. Sinai Hospital. There were a couple of uniformed policemen standing at the door of Trammel's room that everyone was supposed to notice, and several men in suits that she pegged as plainclothes detectives. She showed the note Trammel had sent her and was ushered in.<br/><br/>Trammel was braced up in his bed, tubes attached to several parts of his body. He looked even more emaciated than the last time she'd seen him. "Mr. Trammel?"<br/><br/>"You from the Greys? What can I do for you, Miss?"<br/><br/>"I just wanted to pass on their hope that you get better."<br/><br/>"I'm trying, with God's help."<br/><br/>"I heard your radio program last week. I've been going through some tough times and kind of needed it."<br/><br/>"God loves all of us, although sometimes in different ways. I'm alive because of God's graciousness."<br/><br/>"You really think that? God kept you alive?"<br/><br/>"That's what He told me."<br/><br/>"You mean that literally?"<br/><br/>"Like I said, that's what he told me."<br/><br/>"What...what does he say to you?"<br/><br/>"He tells me the future, and the past, what people are doing."<br/><br/>"You could make a fortune on races or the stock market."<br/><br/>"He doesn't care about things like that."<br/><br/>"What does he want?"<br/><br/>"When he speaks to me through the Mouths of God, He wants everyone to be happy."<br/><br/>"Some people aren't happy unless bad things are happening to other people."<br/><br/>"No, it doesn't have to be that way. We can all be happy and share God's great love."<br/><br/>"I won't lie, I don't have your strong faith. But I respect it."<br/><br/>"You have it, I'm sure. I'm sorry, Miss. I'm very tired. Is there anything else?"<br/><br/>"Just get better, Mr. Trammel."<br/><br/>"It's strange," said Trammel as Millicent opened the door, "It's almost as if I can't see you sometimes."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>They stashed Janet in a bungalow Jimmy had on file. He brought in some nurses to help her recover. She told them that she had been snatched--the story she'd been following was clearly a plant--and then interrogated for a few days, mostly about Jimmy and what he was up to.<br/><br/>"We have to assume they know everything I told Janet," said Jimmy. "She didn't mean to, but everybody talks with enough time."<br/><br/>Dr. Orange and Geronimo agreed silently. <br/><br/>"Why do they want to know so much about you, Jimmy?" asked Geronimo.<br/><br/>"I know the mayor. I'm famous. I have a reputation for working against people like this."<br/><br/>"That's the only reason?"<br/><br/>"Only one I want to discuss."<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445638/#Comment_445638" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-12T16:04:13+00:00" title="June 12, 2015  4:04PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode IV: Why Do We Give Our Love to the Past (Part 2)</b><br/><br/>Geronimo knelt, running his fingers over his rosary again. <i>Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum</i>... he silently intoned. It was his favorite time to be in a church: just after the Mass was over, when the superficially devout had already shuffled outside into the empty pleasures of a California afternoon. The smell of incense lingered, rich, calling up memories of the dusty mountain village in Aragon he had grown up in.<br/><br/>He sat back on the pew, nodding as someone sat down next to him. Then he shot the man a sharp glance.<br/><br/>It was Captain Walker.<br/><br/>"I want to talk to you," he said. "Perhaps not here. Someplace away from a house of God."<br/><br/>"Anything you want to say to me you can say in front of God," said Geronimo gruffly.<br/><br/>"I assure you, God has nothing to do with what I have done."<br/><br/>"God has everything to do with it. It is all His will."<br/><br/>"Trammel is a very sick man. I wanted to stop his madness but preserve his way of making money. For as you know, in America, money is everything. I started out in the barrio. I had nothing, nothing but the respect of the people around me because they knew I could fight. And I knew even then that I must have money, that money was the only way to make your way in this country. Especially if you don't speak English so well, or you aren't the right color. Trammel's business is an ugly business, but they are all ugly businesses. The drug business is taking money from the weak. That is how Wall Street works, that is how this business works."<br/><br/>"You profit from the failings of others."<br/><br/>"So do you. You profit from Ruby's weakness. If she could protect herself, she would not need you."<br/><br/>"I assure you my employment is more than just monetary compensation."<br/><br/>"That is neither here nor there. I have made a terrible mistake."<br/><br/>"Yes, you involved yourself with a man like Trammel."<br/><br/>"Trammel is inconsequential. He is a stupid, fast-talking white man. There are many of those in Los Angeles. They can be useful. Whatever it was he was worshiping, it is not a god. I think it is the Devil. It will destroy us. It will destroy you. It will destroy everything in the world."<br/><br/>"I believe you."<br/><br/>"Se\xf1or, you must stop this. As for me, I am lost. I desire only death."<br/><br/>For the first time Geronimo heard a faint noise, like a whisper...or mastication. It was coming from somewhere on Walker's arm.<br/><br/>"If you wish to be saved," said Geronimo, "I advise you to talk to Father. Your salvation may be at risk."<br/><br/>"I am damned."<br/><br/>"Why do you say so?"<br/><br/>"Satan has placed his mark on me."<br/><br/>"Then God shall wash it clean."<br/><br/>"God has nothing to do with this, senor."<br/><br/><i>[Me: I'm just going to pull out the Stability chart, no reason...]</i><br/><br/>"Tell me what I can do to help you."<br/><br/>"You must destroy the thing that makes this Nectar. This is not the only place in the world it comes from. I only know this one, though. The followers have gone mad...its power is growing. It will destroy us all. Drown the world in this substance until we are all slaves."<br/><br/>Geronimo nodded, and got up. He had just passed the doors in the back of the sanctuary when he heard the gunshot, and the screams of the other people praying.<br/><i>[1-point Stability loss for Geronimo here.]</i><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445665/#Comment_445665" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-15T15:08:38+00:00" title="June 15, 2015  3:08PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode IV: Why Do We Give Our Love to the Past (Part 3)</b><br/><br/>"We have no need of worrying about Walker anymore," said Geronimo when he reached the bungalow. Quite calmly, he told them the story of his encounter at the church. "I suggest we try to find the ultimate source," he said, "since Walker spoke of many of these things."<br/><br/>"Do we want to get rid of the one here?" asked Dr. Orange. "Because we can do it, but it's a big thing to do."<br/><br/>"We must," said Geronimo flatly.<br/><br/><i>[This was a Hard Driver on Geronimo's Duty drive.]</i><br/><br/>"Do we know it would even hurt it?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"If I blow off your arm, even if it doesn't kill you it would hurt it," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"Do you know anything, Jimmy? Any better way?" asked Geronimo.<br/><br/>"I don't know any one way. You just have to survive for as long as you can."<br/><br/>"Are we all going to die?" said Millicent.<br/><br/><i>[Me: Casualties were actually pretty light the last time Jimmy tried this!]</i><br/><br/>"These things...we can't kill it. We can banish it. We can delay its influence on the world. Hopefully until after our time. But they will come back, eventually. Stomping out the little pieces will help...but we need to find the big one."<br/><br/>"Can't we stomp this one on our way out?" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"We can stomp this on our way out," sighed Jimmy.<br/><br/>They went over the architectural plans that Dr. Orange had borrowed from the FBI, marking the hidden basement over it. Dr. Orange proposed crop dusting it with thermite, but was convinced by Jimmy's look of exasperation to table that plan. They decided to build a carefully calibrated demolition charge to take out the building--or at least the thing in the basement.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>"Bernie? Jimmy here. You left a bunch of messages with me."<br/><br/>"Where the hell have you been?"<br/><br/>"Oh..."<br/><br/>"Yeah. I don't care. Look, I got one that's pretty hot, and I don't know what's going on. I mean...I went to church the other day. Can you meet me at the morgue?"<br/><br/>"I'm on my way."<br/><br/>Jimmy pressed down the receiver button on the phone and then dialed Senator Grey to catch up. "So, Jimmy, what's going on now?" asked Grey when he came on. "The Germans going to bomb LA?"<br/><br/>Jimmy paused. "No. And if that did happen, I'd have nothing to do with it. Oh, stay away from Trammel."<br/><br/>"I never wanted to see him in the first place, although I seem to have sent him flowers. Anyway, I got to go make a speech attacking the President."<br/><br/>"Good luck with that."<br/><br/>"It's not always easy being in the opposition party."<br/><br/>Jimmy and Dr. Orange motored down to the City Morgue. Pale-haired Bernie Ohls met them. He looked ashen. "I guess you heard that skel Walker offed himself. In a church, class act. Anyway, we got him down here...and we found something on the body."<br/><br/>"It's really the most fascinating parasite I've ever seen," said the morgue attendant. He flipped back the sheet over Walker's body. On the corpse's upper right arm was an ugly, lipless mouth, with jagged, snaggled teeth. As they watched, a long sticky tongue flicked out of the mouth.<br/><br/>"Don't get too close," said the attendant. "It will bite you. It used to be smaller. I think it's eating the nectrotic flesh. I suppose when it eats enough it will die, or fall off. Or maybe it will eat the whole body! Really quite interesting."<br/><br/>Jimmy pushed the attendant back. "I think you've studied this enough. Bernie, get this guy some time off--he's gone cracked staring at this thing."<br/><br/><i>[Psychoanalysis twigged Jimmy that the attendant wasn't in his right mind.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy approached the body. He grabbed a pen from the attendant's desk and quickly sketched a bent star on the body. <i>Let's see what the Elder Sign does to you</i>, he thought.<br/><br/>The mouth laughed at him, a horrible tinny sound.<br/><br/><i>[Me: It sounds like Gilbert Gottfried getting tossed into a wood chipper! Also, knock off another point of Stability, Jimmy.]</i><br/><br/>Dr. Orange grabbed a bone saw and quickly began attacking the corpse's arm, sawing off everything below the elbow before attacking the shoulder joint.<br/><br/>"What are you doing?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"He's dead, Jim. And we need to study this further."<br/><br/>They placed the snarling joint of flesh into a box and packed it with dry ice and sawdust.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445680/#Comment_445680" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-16T15:33:00+00:00" title="June 16, 2015  3:33PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode IV: Why Do We Give Our Love to the Past (Part 4)</b><br/><br/>Millicent met Dr. Fauche, who was passing through Los Angeles, for coffee.

Nobody could be a real Christian with all the carrying on over there...and...well, I'll show you."<br/><br/>He led Dr. Orange up a path to an isolated part of the garden. Half-buried in the soil was a calcified mouth, very much like the ones he had seen in Ruby's house, or on the piece of flesh he had cut from Walker's corpse. It was frozen in a scream.<br/><br/>"Found this thing one day. It was hissing and biting at me. I'm no coward, but I pissed myself when I saw it, sir. The only thing I could think to do was to get the cross my momma gave me. It was blessed by the Holy Father. So I pulled it out and threw it at the thing...and it <i>swallowed</i> it. And that made it like how you see it now."<br/><br/>"What was that cross made of?"<br/><br/>"Just ordinary metal. But my momma was very devout--woulda been a nun had she not been married. She got it blessed by the Pope in Rome himself. She raised me right. Was strict with us."<br/><br/>"You know, truth be told, I know this man is not of God. And I plan on doing something about that."<br/><br/>"You're in the exterminating line, eh? I could let you drive up here on Mr. Jones' land--he's away this week. There's an old trail that goes up back of the house, and there's a gate. I don't think they watch it no more, \u2018specially after that fireworks thing."<br/><br/>"I heard about all that. Listen," said Dr. Orange, "I know you get paid by the day. Why don't you take some money and go entertain yourself tonight."<br/><br/>Brooks looked at the money. "I could donate it to the church," he said slowly. "And I suppose I could go to Mass tonight."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>While everyone else was out making plans, Millicent went into the laundry room where Dr. Orange had stashed the box he'd brought back from the morgue. She found the box and pulled off the top. A cloud of steam from the dry ice inside blew up in her face, and she heard a weird muttering noise. When the smoke cleared, she saw...what could only be a part of someone's arm, dismembered from a body. And on the chunk of flesh was a horrid Mouth.<br/><br/>As she stared, shocked and fascinated, it seemed to her that she could make out words. Most of the speech was some sibilant, incomprehensible, inhuman language--if it was a language. But then she sometimes heard snatches of recognizable languages. And after a while, she noticed that it kept repeating a phrase in all those languages:<br/><br/>"Do you believe me?"<br/><br/><i>[So! 5-point Mythos shock for seeing this horrible thing, which put Millicent at Shaken with the attendant loss of a point of Sanity. </i>Technically<i> she couldn't make the 1-point Languages spend I offered to decipher the languages the Mouth was speaking, but...Millicent isn't as nice and normal as she appears, and besides speaks six languages.]</i><br/><br/>Suddenly, the Mouth quite clearly said, "They are lying to you."<br/><br/>Millicent snatched up the lid of the box. As she jammed the box shut, she heard the Mouth say one last thing: "Evergreen Cemetery. Plot 9023."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>That Jimmy, Geronimo and Dr. Orange's drove the truck up the old skid trail and onto the Trammel estate. They could see some lights from the Temple of Joy. Most of the facade of the house had been badly damaged by the fire (and fireworks) from their last visit.<br/><br/>As they got closer, they saw the house was being circled by groups of people. Many were carrying buckets and emptying the sticky, viscous contents into bottles and vials on tables. As they approached the crowds, they noticed that the people in them were malnourished--as if they had been doing nothing else but this strange activity for days.<br/><br/>They parked the car and made their way up the hill on foot. As they got closer to the Temple, people mobbed them, waving vials of Nectar at them. Geronimo could see their eyes were staring at things far away--they had the look of victims of shell shock. Most of them were moving around aimlessly, almost without purpose. But the closer they came to the top of the hill, the more the motions of the bodies around them became somehow purposeful\u2014and somehow alien at the same time. Their limbs seemed to undulate weirdly in the glow of light coming from inside the building.<br/><br/>Suddenly the crowd parted, creating a corridor for them to follow into the Temple. Jimmy and Geronimo exchanged glances, and then began to pull the cart holding their bomb through the doors and into the Sanctuary.<br/><br/>When they got inside, they were faced with a large crowd of naked men and women. Behind them they could glimpse a hole in the floor near the center of the room. In unison, all the people said, "Welcome. Dr. Orange."<br/><br/>"You know my name," said the scientist. "What is yours?"<br/><br/>"I am--a god." The crowd was moving around now, and most disconcertingly as people walked by each spoke a word or two of whatever the entity was saying, with the sentence picked up seamlessly by the next person passing by.<br/><br/>"Are you a god?" said the people.<br/><br/>"Yes," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>There was a horrid, inhuman laughter from the crowd, that cut off immediately as if a switch had been thrown. "You are a liar. I am a Liar, they say. I am the great god Nyarlat-hotep."<br/><br/>"I don't buy it."<br/><br/>"Do you believe me?"<br/><br/>"No."<br/><br/>The Tongue began to rise out of the floor, dripping Nectar. It licked the heads of the people close to the hole in the floor. "You have come to destroy me," said the Liar.<br/><br/>"No, presents. We're bringing presents."<br/><br/>"Liar!"<br/><br/>Dr. Orange turned to Jimmy and Geronimo. "As soon as I hit the button, we have 15 seconds," he said.<br/><br/>Jimmy gave a curt nod.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445698/#Comment_445698" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-17T17:38:08+00:00" title="June 17, 2015  5:38PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode IV: Why Do We Give Our Love to the Past (Part 5)</b><br/><br/>The crowd surged forward, clawing at them, trying to pull them down. <br/><br/>Geronimo swept one of the two by fours on the cart up and held it across his body, pushing and shoving people out of the way to give Jimmy and the doctor a path.<br/><br/>Jimmy swept the bomb up in his hands and followed Geronimo's blocks. "Look out!" said Dr. Orange, just in time for Jimmy to pirouette out of the way of a comely blonde woman who dived at his feet.<br/><br/>They felt arms and fingernails scratching them. Teeth bit into their necks and hands. As they got closer to the hole, the crowd began to collapse into them, trying to suffocate them while they were still standing.<br/><br/>Jimmy swept out a blackjack and used it to force his way closer to the pit. He ducked around grasping hands, threw a well-placed kick into the stomach of an elderly man with a look of mindless rage on his face, and managed to catch a glimpse of the Tongue in front of him. He slammed down the panic button and threw the bomb with all his strength.<br/><br/><i>[So, I asked for 30 total points of spends in order to get the bomb into the Mouth. Most of this was Athletics, along with Dr. Orange's Sense Trouble to help Jimmy dodge attacks, and then Weapons and Sense Trouble for the final push. The crowd did a flat 5 points of damage after the first round, because the PCs hadn't spent enough yet to get the bomb into the Mouth; it probably would have done even more damage the second round, but the PCs made that moot.]</i><br/><br/>Geronimo pulled his Russian 9mm out and shot the people closest to him. Although people surged forward to take the places of their fallen companions, it gave him enough space to push through the crowd and sprint out the door. Behind him he heard Dr. Orange scrambling through the crowd. They burst through the doors and ran out on to the lawn.<br/><br/>"How did you get out so fast?" panted Geronimo.<br/><br/>"If there's one thing a Social Democrat knows how to do, it's run from angry mobs!"<br/><br/>Inside the building, Jimmy saw his two friends escaping. The crowd rippled as it shoved towards him. He fired off a few shots from his .45, and then dove for a closet located near two of the support columns for the Sanctuary. <i>Those plans had better have been right</i>, he thought as he pulled the door shut behind him.<br/><br/><i>[So, this was Firearms for Geronimo, Fleeing for the Doc, and Preparedness plus Architecture for Jimmy--he was out of Athletics, but JP pitched me a neat idea.]</i><br/><br/>There was a tremendous explosion. Outside, Dr. Orange and Geronimo were knocked flat by the shockwave, and debris rained down on them. Geronimo threw himself over Julius to protect him from the worst of the blast.<br/><br/>Inside the building, the ceiling collapsed on top of Jimmy as the force of the blast smashed into the walls. As the ringing in his ears stopped, he heard horrible atonal shrieks coming from the crowd gathered outside the house.<br/><br/>He managed to shove the door aside enough to crawl out onto the rubble of the Sanctuary. The dome had collapsed, burying the center of the room under fragments of concrete. He stumbled down the pile of debris and found Dr. Orange and Geronimo.<br/><br/>"What the hell were you thinking?" asked Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"I was thinking, <i>not again</i>," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>They managed to drive the truck away just as the first fire engines were arriving.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Before her date--dinner! just dinner!--with Dr. Fauche, Millicent drove down to Evergreen Cemetery and looked up plot 9023. It had a simple marker, just a lozenge-shaped tombstone. The name on it was Leticia Adams.<br/><br/>She was born in 1919, and had died in 1926.<br/><br/>Millicent felt a cold sweat break over her brow. She had been born in 1919.<br/><br/>She stopped by a library on the way to the restaurant. Checking the 1926 papers, she found the death notice for the girl. She had died of brain cancer at Mt. Sinai hospital.<br/><br/>There was a picture of the girl next to her obituary.<br/><br/>It looked like the picture Vanessa had of her, taken when she had been seven years old.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>When she arrived at the Brown Derby, Dr. Fauche was sitting in a booth, holding a cigarette in one hand and a telephone receiver in the other. "<i>Non Non! Absolument non! Elle est compl\xe8tement d\xe9rang\xe9! Dites-lui... oui? Oui Madame. Oui ... oui ... bien s\xfbr. Pardonnez-moi, madame.</i>" He put down the receiver quickly, but she could still see that his hand was shaking.<br/><br/>"Please forgive me," he said, standing up and kissing her hand. "I was speaking with one of my sponsors."<br/><br/>"They can be demanding sometimes, I gather."<br/><br/>"I suppose you move in such circles. I would not know. I come from a humble village in the Dijon region."<br/><br/>They sat down. Dr. Fauche ordered some wine for them. Millicent let him order for them, and she enjoyed the meal, even though he complained about the food. ("This is not how you cook a steak.")<br/><br/>She had meant to try and drag some information out of him, but she found that she was too tired and frazzled to resist his charming Continental manners. (He held his fork in his left hand! He sent back a bottle of wine! He made the most pleasant conversation about nothing!)<br/><br/>"I never really drink wine," she purred. "I'm too young."<br/><br/>"Really? I've been drinking it since I was twelve." He frowned at the label. "Well...not <i>this</i>."<br/><br/>"Uncle Jack gave me a drink of whiskey once."<br/><br/>"Uncle Jacques? Well, he must have been a Frenchman at heart."<br/><br/><i>[I offered MP a choice: grill Dr. Fauche and get some info, or enjoy a pleasant evening with a dreamy Frenchman and get back a point of Stability. MP dithered until I said it was between her Drive and her hormones, which decided the issue. Her Assess Honesty did tell her that Dr. Fauche was buttering her up, although she didn't know why.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>When she got back to the bungalow--her high heels clicking as she walked through the foyer--she found Jimmy, Geronimo, and Dr. Orange sitting around the kitchen table, covered in soot and dust. Janet Rogers came in with a tray of coffee cups.<br/><br/>"Millicent Lowell, where have you been?" asked Jimmy, voice rising.<br/><br/>"Jimmy, aren't you being tough on the girl?" said Janet.<br/><br/>"I was out Dr. Fauche..."<br/><br/>"I specifically told you not to see the Frenchman!"<br/><br/>"He was nice!"<br/><br/>"Of course he was <i>nice</i>!"<br/><br/>"Wait," said Janet. "You went to dinner with a Frenchman? Was he good-looking?"<br/><br/>"That's not the point!" said Jimmy, as Millicent began to tell Janet about her dinner.<br/><br/>"He didn't touch me," said Millicent.<br/><br/>Jimmy twitched.<br/><br/>"I don't know what you're so worried about," she said.<br/><br/>"We have a lot of things to worry about. We're in a war with extraterr...non-human godlike beings..."<br/><br/>"Maybe he can help us!"<br/><br/>"Wait a minute, <i>non-human godlike beings</i>?" said Janet.<br/><br/>"It's a joke," said Jimmy. "It's just a saying."<br/><br/>"In what language?" said Janet.<br/><br/>"Jimmy's been under a lot of pressure," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Yes. Apparently he blew up a building tonight."<br/><br/>"Can it be proven it was him?"<br/><br/>"Hopefully not."<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445717/#Comment_445717" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-18T15:07:16+00:00" title="June 18, 2015  3:07PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode IV: Why Do We Give Our Love to the Past (Part 6)</b><br/><br/>Bernie Ohls looked like he was on his third gimlet when Jimmy arrived at Victor's Bar. "Thanks for coming, Jimmy," he said.<br/><br/>"Sure. You sounded worried on the phone."<br/><br/>"I guess you heard about that, gas main explosion out at Echo Park last night."<br/><br/>"I've been dealing with--"<br/><br/>"Look, it's going to go down as a gas main explosion. So you owe me for that. But I think maybe I owe <i>you</i> a lot more than that."<br/><br/>"Yeah, I can't talk about it."<br/><br/>"Probably a good idea for you to get out of LA for a while. No rush, but it probably won't be long before I have to start telling the State people where to get stuffed." He gulped down his drink. "Is there...anything I should be worried about?"<br/><br/>"For now, no. And I was already making plans to get out of town for a while."<br/><br/>"Good. Take--take care of yourself, Jimmy."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Jimmy pushed past the smiling crowd of receptionists. "Mr. Wright! We've missed you! Can I get you a cup of coffee!"<br/><br/>Jimmy waved them off, squeezed his way into his office, and locked the doors behind him. He sighed and closed his eyes.<br/><br/>Then he opened them with a start. His safe had been cracked, and files were scattered all around the floor.<br/><br/><i>Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you</i>, he thought as he went through the mess, carefully filing everything away.<br/><br/>The letter Jack Brady had given him to hold onto for Mirabelle was missing. <i>One of the moles must be looking for background on her</i>, he thought. This was bad. They had taken a lot of precautions to make sure nobody would ever know what happened to her. So many, in fact, that he himself didn't know.<br/><br/>He dialed Vanessa's house in Venice Beach, and after no one picked up there, rang the Grey's house in Orange County. Their butler told him that Mrs. Grey was on vacation and hung up before Jimmy could even ask where she was.<br/><br/>His intercom buzzed. "Mr. Wright? I have Karen Eliot for you."<br/><br/>He picked up the phone. "Karen, nice to hear from you."<br/><br/>"Jimmy! Listen, could we meet for lunch today? Say out in Santa Monica?"<br/><br/>"Always a pleasure, Karen. I'll see you there."<br/><br/>Betty was happy to see him when he arrived in the auto pool. "Mr. Wright! I've been reading that book you gave me, see?" She held up the book, and a comic book slid out of it.<br/><br/>Jimmy raised an eyebrow.<br/><br/>"I was using it for a bookmark."<br/><br/>"We all hate boring bookmarks. I see Arturo's not done with the other car yet, let's take the sedan."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>"So how do you know Miss Eliot? I know you see her ever month or so." Betty asked as they drove down Santa Monica Boulevard.<br/><br/>"We go way back. Knew her before she was an actress. Matter of fact, she got me one of my first jobs as a PI."<br/><br/>"What did she do back then?"<br/><br/>"She wanted to be a writer."<br/><br/>He had Betty drop him off by the pier and then he walked down the boardwalk for a while. Standing near a pay telescope he saw a shortish woman with dark black hair, wearing sunglasses and clutching a book. As he came closer, he saw it was <i>The Collected Writings of Jackson Elias</i>. Janet Rogers' face was on the back cover; she had edited it.<br/><br/>"Can you believe this Rogers cow?" she said by way of greeting. "She makes Jax sound like an idiot."<br/><br/>Jimmy gulped. "I'm sure she didn't mean to."<br/><br/>"No understanding of what it was like to be a woman investigative reporter back then," muttered Karen. "Plus she got <i>all</i> the details of the India trip wrong."<br/><br/>"So why do you need to talk to me?" said Jimmy, smiling.<br/><br/>"You'd tell me if anything was going on, right?"<br/><br/>"As much as I could."<br/><br/>"I've been having weird dreams lately. Dreams about...well, <i>Him</i>."<br/><br/>It must have been Jimmy's imagination that seemed to make a shadow fall across the sun just as she spoke.<br/><br/>"He's not in play again, is he?" asked Karen. "Because I thought you said you did the...thing, you know, the magic...and..."<br/><br/>"I did things. But I'm pretty sure we're not the first people to go up against him."<br/><br/>"We're going to be all right, aren't we?"<br/><br/>"Yeah. I'm looking into it."<br/><br/>Karen sighed. "Good. So, let's get lunch? Let me tell you about this stupid thing I'm doing on the radio..."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Janet and Millicent hit the tennis court. "I dated a Frenchman once," Janet said as she served.<br/><br/>"What was he like?" said Millicent after she smashed a winner past Janet.<br/><br/>"Oh...he was fast."<br/><br/>"Professor Fauche isn't so fast."<br/><br/>"That's too bad."<br/><br/>"Yeah. He was a perfect gentleman."<br/><br/>"You poor dear. Well, he probably can't date his own students."<br/><br/>"Oh. Yeah, that makes sense."<br/><br/>"So I guess you'll have to get expelled," said Janet as she lined up her serve. "That's what I did."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Geronimo spent a few days going to Mass in the morning and evening. He paid to have one said in memory of his brother, and finally, when his guilty soul could no longer contain it, went to Confession and told the priest that he was involved in the "gas main explosion."<br/><br/>"You should turn yourself in, my son."<br/><br/>"All in good time, Father," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"I'm afraid I can't offer you absolution until you try to make amends."<br/><br/>"Father," said Geronimo in a strained voice, "believe me, this was in service of God, against the forces of darkness."<br/><br/>The priest leaned back on the other side of the screen. "I...find that hard to believe, my son...but very well. <i>Te absolvo a peccatis tuis in nomine Patris, et Filii...</i> "<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445727/#Comment_445727" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-19T14:52:32+00:00" title="June 19, 2015  2:52PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode IV: Why Do We Give Our Love to the Past (Part 7)</b><br/><br/>Millicent had a dream. <br/><br/>She was walking through the dark woods at night, in her nightgown. Pine needles crunched underneath her bare feet. Now and again through gaps in the trees she could see the reflection of the moon on a large, dark lake.<br/><br/>She stopped. Ahead of her was a large house. There were a few lights on. She walked slowly towards the house, approaching from the back, the side facing the lake. There was a nice decked area where people could sit and look out over the lake.<br/><br/>As she passed under a window, she looked up. A woman who looked exactly like Vanessa was sitting inside.<br/><br/>She tapped on the window. Vanessa looked outside, and started. She rushed to the window and opened it.<br/><br/>"What are you doing out there?" she hissed.<br/><br/>"I'm very cold," said Millicent.<br/><br/>Vanessa helped her into the house through the windowframe. "What on earth are you doing here? How did you get here? Why are you wearing a nightgown?"<br/><br/>"I must be dreaming, right?"<br/><br/>Vanessa's face grew still. "Tell me very carefully what happened."<br/><br/>"I went to sleep in our safe house. Then I had this dream about seeing you, which is wonderful, because I've missed you so much."<br/><br/>"I've missed you too, darling. But...this is...this wasn't supposed to happen."<br/><br/>"We must both be dreaming. That's so nice. I love you."<br/><br/>"I love you too, but you'll have to get out of here before they find you. And darling...this isn't a dream."<br/><br/>Vanessa handed her some shoes and threw a coat over Millicent's shoulders. She helped the girl climb back out of the window. "Go, darling, find someplace warm!"<br/><br/>Millicent trudged through the cold woods. There were patches of snow in places, and the air felt thin. After several hours, she reached the outskirts of a hamlet. She paused at a clothesline to find a dress to wear, and then pushed on into the settlement.<br/><br/>There was a small coffee shop near the center of the hamlet. "Tahoma's best pie!" read a sign hung in a window. She knew where she was now. Tahoma, California, near Lake Tahoe. The Grey's had a house up there, she remembered.<br/><br/>And it was over four hundred miles from Los Angeles.<br/><br/>There was a telegraph office near the coffee shop. She sat down on a hitching post in front of it and waited another miserably cold hour until a young man appeared. "Morning, Miss," he said with a Western twang as he unlocked the door. "Need to send a telegram?"<br/><br/>"Yes..."<br/><br/>"My goodness, you look half-froze! Set over there by the stove."<br/><br/>The young man gave her a blank form to fill out. "That's a strange thing to say," he said, reading it after she was done.<br/><br/>Millicent shrugged. "'Price of grain falling in Portland' was what I was told to send."<br/><br/>The young man smiled and quickly tapped out the message.<br/><br/>Almost immediately after he was done, the telegraph began to clack. Puzzled, the man wrote out the reply. <i>Wait in nearest restaurant for us to contact you.</i><br/><br/>"I guess I'll head over to the coffee shop."<br/><br/>"Tell Mabel I said hi."<br/><br/>She waited several hours in a booth in the back. The owner of the shop slipped her a pastry. "On the house, hon," she said. "I suppose whoever sent you down here didn't give you any money for breakfast. The shame of these fat cats. Cain't even let a girl relax while they're on vacation."<br/><br/>Millicent nodded.<br/><br/>A car pulled up outside. A man stepped out of the back. He held a white cane in one hand, and slowly made his way into the shop. The owner led him to Millicent's booth.<br/><br/>He sat down in front of her. He had a pleasant face, a white beard, and dark glasses. "I don't know you, Miss, and I will never know who you are. But I was instructed to give you this."<br/><br/>He handed Millicent an envelope. Inside was several hundred dollars in American currency, gold coins, and British pounds. There were three passports, each with her picture but a different name. A small notebook held a list of phone numbers. Some were clearly in other countries.<br/><br/>"Do you require anything else? I have a suitcase with clothing in your size, if you require."<br/><br/>"Thank you. Do you know how I can stop this from happening again?"<br/><br/>"I'm afraid not, ma'am. But you must never use that telegraph address again. Good day." \n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>"I have Lake Tahoe on the line for you," said the long distance operator to Jimmy when he answered the phone.<br/><br/>"Put it on," said Jimmy, puzzled. <br/><br/>"Mr. Wright?"<br/><br/>Jimmy twitched. He covered the phone with one hand. "Geronimo! Check Millicent's room!"<br/><br/>He waited a moment. "She's not there," said Geronimo, walking into the kitchen.<br/><br/>"What are you doing in Lake Tahoe!" Jimmy screamed into the phone.<br/><br/>"I don't know!"<br/><br/>"Are you all right?"<br/><br/>"I'm fine...is this going to keep happening to me?"<br/><br/>"I don't know what is happening to you! How are you getting home?"<br/><br/>"I can hitch a ride on a truck to Truckee and take the train from there..."<br/><br/>The next night Jimmy met her at the train station along with a couple of the guys he kept around for enforcement work. "Just what's going on with the girl?" one of them asked him.<br/><br/>"I honestly don't know."<br/><br/>"Oh...kind of was used to thinking you did."<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448203/#Comment_448203" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-24T19:11:45+00:00" title="August 24, 2015  7:11PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So yikes!

Dr. Orange increased the flaps while Betty, sitting in the co-pilot's seat, spoke to the control tower over the radio.<br/><br/>The Electra skimmed lightly over the runway before touching down with a gentle bump and taxiing to the hangar.<br/><br/><i>[I normally don't call for Pilot checks for long-distance travel, but Mexico City is a notoriously difficult place to land, so I figured it was worth having whoever was the pilot have to spend some points to simulate that. With RP out, Dr. Orange got to show off his piloting skills.]</i><br/><br/>After decamping to a large hotel paid for by Jimmy's checkbook, they set out to chase down their only lead--the post office box of Luz Discos.<br/><br/>"Have you heard from Ruby?" asked Jimmy as they drove into the Zocalo.<br/><br/>"Her last telegram said she and the Captain were headed to Puerto Vallerta. That must be the post office ahead."<br/><br/>The building was new, done up in the full Art Deco style. The post office boxes lined the walls of the lobby, and it was easy to locate Box 1629. Opening it was somewhat greater a challenge.<br/><br/>Millicent sidled up to the counter, trying to remember what Ruby had taught her about bribing people. She pulled her blouse a little lower and caught a clerk's eye. "Se\xf1or, por favor, es muy importante--"<br/><br/>"I speak English," said the clerk in a bored, disdainful voice. "I go to movies all the time. Humphrey Bogart. Bang Bang."<br/><br/>"It's really important that we get into our box, but we lost our key--"<br/><br/>"There's a hundred peso lost key fine." The clerk rummaged in a drawer and tossed a key down as Millicent passed him some bills. "Give it back when you leave, I don't want to get into trouble."<br/><br/><i>[Bargain use by MP.]</i><br/><br/>Inside they found an old power bill for Luz Records. The address listed on the bill was 33 Morelos Avenue.<br/><br/>"We found them," said the doctor, quite pleased.<br/><br/>There was also a letter from Samson Trammell, asking about where the "product" was and when he could expect his next record. <br/><br/>Millicent brought back the key and another hundred pesos. "Can you look up the name on this box?"<br/><br/>"What, you don't know who you are anymore?" said the clerk. He slid the money onto his lap. "Card says it belongs to a Jonathon Brooks of Luz Records. Now hit the bricks, kid."<br/><br/>Jimmy looked closer at the power bill. "They're using a lot less power," he said as Millicent came back. "Like they haven't been using it for a while."<br/><br/>"Consumption like that means they're not really running anything," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/><i>[Accounting use by JP--who had specifically used XP to get the skill; we rationalized that having found out uncomfortable truths about his accountant, he was sharpening his old forensic accounting skills. Electrical Repair as an Investigative skill gave them the info on the power consumption.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Luz Records wasn't much of a going concern--it was on the second floor of a stucco office building, across from a shoe store and a tacqueria, whose owner remembered the people from Luz.<br/><br/>"Yeah, they moved a bunch of stuff out a couple of weeks ago, and I haven't seen them since. Good riddance, bunch of Communists anyway."<br/><br/>"Communists?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Yeah, Senor Brooks? They call him the John Reed of Mexico."<br/><br/>"Wasn't John Reed the John Reed of Mexico?" asked Millicent.<br/><br/>The man shrugged. "All I know is that's what people said. Well, at least he said. Now, you want to buy some tacos? They're really yummy. If you spend another ten pesos you get special toppings, like I don't tell anyone you came."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>A few tacos later, Millicent used her skeleton key to pop open the door to Luz Records.<br/><br/>"Not much from the inside either," said Jimmy. There were a bunch of empty file cabinets and a few desks. The room had the desolate feeling of a public space that had been abandoned suddenly.<br/><br/>On the back wall was a large poster in the Socialist Realist style, showing a handsome man holding the red hammer and sickle flag of the Soviet Union. Under it was written "<i>Partido de los Trabajadores Internacional de Mexico</i>."<br/><br/>"Never heard of them," said Geronimo. "And I'm reasonably up on my Socialist parties."<br/><br/>"Didn't Trotsky just come to Mexico?" asked Millicent.<br/><br/>"Yes. Supposed to be staying Diego Rivera and his wife."<br/><br/>Millicent found some copies of Brooks's books. "These aren't very good," she told Geronimo after flipping through a couple.<br/><br/>Jimmy found some invoices and bills in a wastepaper basket. "Looks like they were pricing album covers. Five and six disks. And seems they recorded some place called Estudio de Ma\xf1ana. 1220 Morelos Avenue, not far from here."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448205/#Comment_448205" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-24T19:13:45+00:00" title="August 24, 2015  7:13PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode V: Lawyers, Guns, and Money (Part 2)</b><br/><br/>They drove up the street. They were in Coyoacan proper now, and the bohemian atmosphere of the district became apparent, especially in the number of expat Americans and Europeans hanging around in parks and cantinas.<br/><br/>Estudio de Ma\xf1ana proved to be a modest one-story tall building with a faded sign hanging over the street. Dr. Orange knocked on the door. There was no answer, but he frowned.<br/><br/>"I think there's someone in there," he said to Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Por favor, abierto la puerta," said Millicent.<br/><br/>There was no answer. Jimmy swung around the corner to the delivery door. It was locked as well, but he camped there to see if anyone tried to come out the back. A few kids watched him, and he tossed them some coins.<br/><br/>He waited for the children to head up the alley, and then, well, jimmied the door with a small prybar. He slipped it open and slid inside.<br/><br/>There was a recording area on his left, with soundproofing and microphones. Down a short corridor he saw a large waiting area. A man was crouched behind a desk. Jimmy padded up behind him and touched him on the shoulder.<br/><br/>The man started. "Tiene un arma!" he said.<br/><br/>"What?"<br/><br/>"I said, I have a gun."<br/><br/>"I have a fist," said Jimmy, showing him it. "And a gun."<br/><br/>"You make a compelling case, Se\xf1or," said the man. "Please don't hurt me."<br/><br/>"Let's open the front door."<br/><br/>"All right. I guess if I have to die, this is as good a way as any." He yanked opened the door. "Oh great, more gringos. Come in."<br/><br/>"Taco?" offered Millicent.<br/><br/>"No thanks, kid." The man glanced down the hallway. "Hey, did you break the lock on the back door? You know how much I paid for that? The guy said it was impervious!"<br/><br/>"It's very pervious, se\xf1or," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Great, I got ripped off <i>and</i> I got to replace the lock. Great job, Victor. You're the next RCA."<br/><br/>Jimmy hauled out some bills. "For the lock," he said.<br/><br/>"I'll probably need a better lock," said the man.<br/><br/>"Don't push it. What's your name?"<br/><br/>"Victor Cortez."<br/><br/>"Do you live here, Mr. Cortez?" asked Millicent, looking at a couch that had clearly been slept on.<br/><br/>"No, I have a lovely house. I do not feel safe there, so I live here now."<br/><br/>"Why don't you feel safe? Is it a Brooks problem?" asked Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Brooks? Who's Brooks?"<br/><br/>"Luz Records."<br/><br/>"Oh, them. They recorded here. Not recently, haven't seen them in a couple of weeks. Right, the Communista. He and his little girlfriend Leticia. Talk about dragon ladies."<br/><br/>"Why are you sleeping here?" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Oh, yeah. I was scared because the last time I was home, some guys tried to break in, that big Russki, Konavalev. Works for Brooks--he's a Commie, knows a lot of Russians."<br/><br/> "Why would the Russians want to break in?"<br/><br/>"Who knows why a Communist does anything? I work hard, try to make an honest peso. Have my own business, people buy my records, don't buy my records, it's capitalism. The way the world works."<br/><br/>"You must have done something to anger them," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Do I look like the kind of guy who angers anyone?"<br/><br/>Geronimo glared in response.<br/><br/>"Tell me about the last recording session," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"They came here, brought their own sound guy--I rent the board, make some extra money. But that's not important. It's Jorge, Jorge Novo. He was the guy who presses the records, the publisher. He didn't like those records...and one day he tells me, 'Victor, I don't know about these guys. It's one thing to record the Internationale in Spanish, but these records? They're evil.' I don't know how that could be..."<br/><br/>"Where can we find Brooks?" said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"They must have their own place to record now. But I went to their penthouse once. I wrote the address down on a matchbook. I keep a jar at home with matchbooks from all the bars or restaurants I go to. That's where it is, back at my place. But de la Luz, Leticia? She used to have a place near here."<br/><br/>"Why do they want to hurt you?"<br/><br/>"I don't know! They did all kinds of crazy things at Brooks' place, drugs, who knows. These musicians, they're all prostitutes."<br/><br/>"What bar's matchbook did you write down the address on?" asked Millicent.<br/><br/>"The Suckling Pig. El Cochinello. That's good, you ever have it? They don't serve it there. It's a complicated dish! They only serve tacos! Why are you interrogating me about bar food!"<br/><br/>"Where's that bar?"<br/><br/>"Oh, you don't want to go there, it's not any good. And if you want suckling pig, I know a couple of places. You have to go to Abuelita's, about three blocks from here. So good."<br/><br/>"Why were you at the bar if it's no good?" asked Jimmy.<br/><br/>"We were just talking! Me, Luz, Brooks, Konovalev. He's crazy. Beat up the bartender just because he didn't have vodka. Well, he had vodka, but Konovalev said, This? Vodka? No. Then he hit him. Blood, vodka everywhere. Anyway, that's not a good bar. You want to go to La Paz."<br/><br/>"Why?"<br/><br/>"The musicians Brooks used play there. Nice guys. Javier Luna y sus hermanos, he's really good. Owes me money. I could have bought a better gun with what he owes me. Maybe a Thompson. Or a guard dog."<br/><br/>"Like a poodle?" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Why would I want a little dog like that?"<br/><br/>"They yap a lot. Good alarm systems."<br/><br/>"Oh, true. Not a German shepherd. Germans have done enough to Mexico. No offense, se\xf1or," he said to the doctor. "Or maybe hire some tough guys. Not Russians. Maybe Guatamalans. They're tough. Or Hondurans...they work cheaper. Anyway, I gave you everything I know, so you can leave me alone."<br/><br/>"Will you be okay?" asked Millicent.<br/><br/>"No! I don't have a lock on my back door anymore! Look, you made this mess, you should take care of me."<br/><br/>"I paid you for the lock," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Good, maybe my grandmother can pay for my funeral."<br/><br/>"You didn't know it wasn't any good until I broke it. I did you a favor."<br/><br/>"Yeah, but I had peace of mind."<br/><br/>"I suppose you can't go to the cops?" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"They won't do anything to Brooks. He's a typical American communist, his family's rich and he still has plenty of money."<br/><br/>"We're done here," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"What about me? I could get killed!" wailed Cortez.<br/><br/>"You have a gun."<br/><br/>"I don't know how to shoot this thing, I bought it off a Nicaraguan!"<br/><br/>"Hold it like this," said Millicent, picking up Cortez's pistol. "Remember, squeeze the trigger slowly..."<br/><br/>"Who is this crazy American girl? Anyway, you can never get into my house. It's a fortress."<br/><br/>Jimmy and Geronimo glared at him.<br/><br/>"All right, here's the keys. I don't need to live. But I won't tell you where the jar is. You'll have to search for a long time. You'll never find it on top of the fireplace mantel...damnit."<br/><br/>Jimmy was the last to leave. As he closed the door, he took a last quick glance at the forlorn face of Victor Cortez, already crouching behind his desk again.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448206/#Comment_448206" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-24T19:14:25+00:00" title="August 24, 2015  7:14PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode V: Lawyers, Guns, and Money (Part 3)</b><br/><br/>"How did you get to Lake Tahoe?" demanded Jimmy when they got back to the hotel.<br/><br/>"I don't know! But I don't think I walked, my feet would hurt if I did."<br/><br/>"You couldn't even have gotten there!"<br/><br/>"I know...I thought I must be dreaming. That made a lot more sense than teleporting. Everyone knows that's impossible, right? Nobody can teleport...can they?"<br/><br/>Jimmy gulped, remembering a little girl he'd once see walk through a wall. "It's...hard. Most of the time they do tricks to fool you."<br/><br/>"I wanted to see...a friend of mine, who was in Lake Tahoe. But I thought we were both dreaming together."<br/><br/>"Who was it?"<br/><br/>"Vanessa."<br/><br/>"Vanessa...<i>Brady</i>? She's your friend?"<br/><br/>"She's the friend of all the orphans at my school. She got in some trouble, so Mrs. Grey sent her up to their place in Tahoe. She'll be okay there, right?"<br/><br/>"I think so. What did she say?"<br/><br/>"That I wasn't dreaming, and that this wasn't supposed to happen."<br/><br/>"That...sounds like Vanessa."<br/><br/>"I don't want anything bad to happen to her...which means I probably don't want <i>us</i> to happen to her."<br/><br/>"I'm afraid she may already be mixed up in all this."<br/><br/>"By the way, you know who Leticia Adams is?"<br/><br/>"No, never heard of her."<br/><br/>"Oh. I saw a picture of her once and she looked like somebody I used to know."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Jimmy was sitting in a cantina, vaguely listening to the band singing in the background. He scribbled on another telegram slip, sighed, and took another drink of tequila. In the center of the room, a well-tanned woman was dancing. Jimmy noticed she was wearing, improbably enough, fruit on her hat.<br/><br/>He blinked again. "Ruby?" he sputtered.<br/><br/>Ruby stopped dancing and lurched toward Jimmy. "<i>James</i>. I just got in the other night."<br/><br/>"I thought you and Murphy were still sailing?"<br/><br/>"Oh, the Captain had to dash off and do something. Some island to discover. He left me at Puerto Vallarta and I've had just an <i>astonishing</i> time getting here." Her voice dropped. "The strangest thing, though. The further I got from Los Angeles, the less I craved...the stuff. But the closer I got to Mexico City...the more I felt the craving. What do you think it means?"<br/><br/>"Something bad. Come on, I'll take you to the hotel."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>The next morning they drove out to Victor Cortez's home in Coyoac\xe1n. It was a small bungalow on a quiet street. Chickens clucked in a coop a few houses away.<br/><br/>Ruby yawned and stepped out of the car. Geronimo swung out after her and grabbed her wrist. "Someone is watching us from next door. There, in the porch, with plants arranged in front of him."<br/><br/>Dr. Orange walked nonchalantly away, rounded the corner, and ran up the block until he was behind the house Geronimo had indicated. He hopped over the wall and landed in a crouch without making a noise. From his vantage point, he could see the man was holding a rifle.<br/><br/>Julius grabbed a flower pot and threw it at the man who ducked at the last second. The pot smashed into the wall. The man clubbed his rifle and swung it at Dr. Orange, who jumped back just out of reach. The man babbled something in a bizarre, ululating language.<br/><br/><i>That's how the Mouths talk</i>, thought Dr. Orange. He pulled out his pistol and whipped the  barrel at the other man's face. Blood spurted from the man's nose. He wheeled the rifle around and then stopped as he felt Ruby's pistol being jammed into the nape of his neck.<br/><br/>Geronimo pulled the man around from behind and kicked the rifle away. Jimmy slapped some cuffs down on his wrists.<br/><br/>Ruby was listening to the man's incoherent ravings for a moment. "He's saying...you will all die...the Mouth will devour you...I think he's been waiting for a while."<br/><br/>"You can understand him?" demanded Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"A little...it doesn't feel good."<br/><br/><i>[So...not strictly by the rules of the campaign, but when has that ever stopped me? RP made an offer of a Cthulhu Mythos spend to be able to understand the Tongue of Lies, and quoth the Keeper, why the heck not?]</i><br/><br/>With the threat neutralized, they walked into Cortez's house. The place had been completely demolished by people who had thoroughly searched the place. Over the mantelpiece they saw "See You" painted in a substance Dr. Orange was sure was Nectar. Geronimo found the glass jar that Cortez had told them about in the corner and searched through the matchbooks until he found the one with Brooks' address on it.<br/><br/>The phone rang. <br/><br/>Everyone paused for a moment, and then with a sigh Jimmy answered it.<br/><br/>"Mr. Wright?" said a voice with a thick Russian accent. "Victor wanted to talk to you."<br/><br/>"Lots of people want to talk to me."<br/><br/>"Unfortunately, he can no longer talk. You should take better care of your friends, Mr. Wright."<br/><br/>"Where is he?"<br/><br/>"Ask for him and you will find him a grave man. And you will be too if you don't return to Los Angeles. This warning is a courtesy I give you because of your reputation--it would be a shame to damage you."<br/><br/>"You're a gentleman."<br/><br/>"No. I am not." There was a click as the other man hung up.<br/><br/>"Victor's dead," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"That is unfortunate," said Geronimo gravely.<br/><br/><i>[Aaand everyone knocked off 2 points of Stability for having indirectly caused the death of an innocent.

Jimmy and Geronimo looked for the tail they knew must be there without success.<br/><br/>The complex was a simple building in the local style--the apartments opened directly onto a long balcony which ringed a small central corridor. The door to Leticia's apartment was open. The apartment was in a state of disarray, but after a few moments they realized that the place hadn't been searched but <i>packed</i>--and rather hastily.<br/><br/>"Look at these," said Jimmy to Geronimo. "These photos have been scratched up <i>through the glass</i>."<br/><br/>Geronimo pulled the heavily scarred photos out of their frames and held them up together. "I suppose this is Miss de la Luz."<br/><br/>"That's not her real name," said Dr. Orange. "These bills are for a Rosario Lopez."<br/><br/>Nothing else of interest turned up after a quick search. "Let's talk to the neighbors," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>Ruby spoke to the man in the next door apartment, who complained that she had woken him. "I work the night shift," he grumbled. "Good they are gone now. Always with big parties and playing music. And the bed bang bang bang into the wall. I mean, romance okay...but there's got to be a limit, right?"<br/><br/>"No," said Ruby. "What kind of music did they play?"<br/><br/>"Norteamericano stuff, Mexican music...sometimes they would rehearse with a band. Played strange music, weird lyrics: my mouth, my love, my mouth..."<br/><br/>Downstairs they found a nice older woman in the apartment directly below Leticia's. "Oh, you're talking about Rosario," she said.<br/><br/>From inside the apartment, a man in a tee shirt yelled out, "When's breakfast?"<br/><br/>"<i>Hecho in un momento. </i>The crazy girl? She's gone now. It's great."<br/><br/>"<i>D\xf3nde est\xe1 el arroz</i>?" the man shouted.<br/><br/>The woman shook her head. "I know, me too," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"I talked to Rosario when she first moved in. She was broke. Communists, you know? Then Mr. Brooks started to show up and she changed her name. Leticia de la Luz, I mean, really? He bought her clothes and fancy jewelry."<br/><br/>"Did anyone who came here strike you as overly dangerous?"<br/><br/>"That Russian guy, the big one."<br/><br/>"I've never dealt with a Russian I liked," said Ruby sympathetically.<br/><br/>"Yes," said the woman. "Look, he's coming in the courtyard right now." She slammed the door behind them when they all swiveled around to look at the courtyard.<br/><br/>Ruby knocked on the next door. "Sir have you heard about the glory of our Lord Jesus?"<br/><br/>"Yes, every day at church," said the man, moving to slam the door.<br/><br/>"I ran out of pamphlets," said Ruby a bit desperately. "Could we come in to talk?"<br/><br/>The man looked her up and down. "Sure, American, come on in," he said with a grin.<br/><br/>He stepped to one side and Ruby sauntered in. As he began to close the door, Geronimo stepped into view and slammed it open with one hand. "We also want to talk about our Lord," he said, holding the door open while Dr. Orange and Jimmy hustled in.<br/><br/>"Who are you? I don't have any money!" said the man.<br/><br/>"Don't worry. I do," said Jimmy, holding out some crisp peso notes.<br/><br/>"Hey, waitaminute, is this some kind of sex thing?" said the man.<br/><br/>"No."<br/><br/>"It can be," muttered Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>Jimmy held a finger to his lips and looked at the man, and then Dr. Orange. Ruby pushed Julius over to a couch while Jimmy and Geronimo peered through the Venetian blinds.<br/><br/>A tall man came into the courtyard. He had a rough thatch of graying hair and was wearing a flowered shirt. For all that, he projected a serious air of menace. Behind him came several Mexicans, with the same spaced-out look in their eyes as the sniper at Victor's house had shown.<br/><br/>The Russian and his men went up the stairs to Leticia's room, but quickly came back out again. Soon Geronimo and Jimmy heard banging on the doors of the apartments on either side of Leticia's flat.<br/><br/>"Ambush or follow?" said Jimmy. "I prefer following."<br/><br/>"How are we going to get out?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"There's usually a bathroom window out onto an alley," said Jimmy. <br/><br/>This proved to be the case, and soon they were in the bathroom, watching Dr. Orange already beginning to squirm out into the alley.<br/><br/>"It's Berlin '33 all over again!" he hissed.<br/><br/>They pulled him back into the bathroom and then Geronimo smoothly slipped out into the alley. He gave a quick look around and then helped Ruby down. Soon they were all gathered in a corner of the alley.<br/><br/>They could see their car parked on the street. "They're for sure watching it," muttered Jimmy.<br/><br/>"How do they always know where we are?" said Geronimo in a low voice.<br/><br/>Jimmy risked going up the alley for a better look. Across the plaza he could see a street cafe, cattycorner to their car. He scanned the patrons of the cafe carefully. He saw one man in a dark suit, wearing glasses, who had the look of watching without watching.<br/><br/><i>[Streetwise spend by JP.]</i><br/><br/>"I know that look," he muttered. "I hire people with that look."<br/><br/>"Did you hire him?" asked Ruby.<br/><br/>"No!"<br/><br/>"Are you sure?"<br/><br/>"Wright-O'Donnell Investigations <i>Internac\xedonal</i>," said Geronimo wryly.<br/><br/>Jimmy winced. "Let's hope the rabbit hole doesn't go that deep. He's definitely a watcher, probably a pro."<br/><br/>"Our best bet is to hole up until they leave," said Geronimo. "Come with me." He led them to the end of the alley and then they sneaked along the edge of the courtyard until he found the laundry room. They crouched down under some empty clothesbaskets until they heard the pounding feet of Konovalev and his men.<br/><br/>"Two go to the checkpoint and wait. They're somewhere around here, keep your eyes open. The rest with me," said the Russian in Spanish.<br/><br/>As soon as they were the Russian was gone, Jimmy led them down the alley and into the warren of narrow passageways behind the row houses. He doubled back and took a twisted route to the cafe. Walking quickly, he and Geronimo came at the watcher's table from two directions.<br/><br/>"Hi," said Jimmy, sitting down.<br/><br/>The man dropped his crossword puzzle and looked up to see Geronimo next to him.<br/><br/>"Jimmy, Geronimo, I can explain."<br/><br/>"Are you one of my guys?"<br/><br/>"No, I'm just paid to watch you. I'm Gonchi del Toro. First, I'm an admirer of your work--I'm a private investigator too."<br/><br/>"Who hired you?"<br/><br/>"Who do you think? Brooks. I was sent on your tail as soon as you arrived. Look, if you want me to get scarce, I'll go...but these guys play for keeps. I was only doing my job."<br/><br/>"How much?"<br/><br/>"I need something to get away...these guys will kill me if they think I've betrayed them. I never meant any harm, I just figured you'd leave."<br/><br/>"Brooks is that scary?"<br/><br/>"Well...not really. But he knows a lot of scary guys. To be honest, I didn't like working against you. It gave me a bad feeling. And then what happened to Cortez..."<br/><br/>Ruby counted out several wads of bills, and Geronimo gave them to Gonchi. "Take off for a few days," he said. "Don't go to L. A."<br/><br/>Gonchi took the bills. "Brooks is planning something," he said, standing up slowly. "He's been really excited. He's holed up in some hidden studio, him and Leticia. I haven't seen her for a long time, but I know she's still recording."<br/><br/>"Good luck," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"You too. I'd hate to hear that you got killed." He walked towards the plaza. Just before he left the cafe he turned around. "Oh, if I were you, I'd avoid feeding any birds."<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448220/#Comment_448220" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-25T13:46:04+00:00" title="August 25, 2015  1:46PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode V: Lawyers, Guns, and Money (Part 5)</b><br/><br/>"You sure this is a good idea?" said Jimmy to Ruby as they drove down the streets of Coyoac\xe1n.<br/><br/>"Trust me, Diego's a friend, and he knows how to hide people."<br/><br/>Jimmy grunted. They pulled up to a large villa on the corner of Londres Avenue.<br/><br/>"It's...it's...so <i>blue</i>," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Frieda owns the place, they painted it like that ages ago," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"I'm more worried about those guys on the corner," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Russians," said Dr. Orange. "You can tell by the cigarettes."<br/><br/>They parked the car and walked over to the house. "What are you doing?" one of the Russians barked at them. "Do you have business?"<br/><br/>"I'm one of his backers from America," said Ruby, handing him a calling card.<br/><br/>After a while, they were beckoned inside. They met Diego Rivera in the courtyard, sitting near a man with gold-rimmed spectacles and an unruly brush of white hair.<br/><br/>"Hello, Mr. Trotsky!" said Ruby brightly.<br/><br/>The man stood up slowly and a bit painfully. "Please, Comrade will do. But call me Leon."<br/><br/>"Dr. Orange," said Julius in French. "Big fan."<br/><br/>"Ah, one of our German comrades!" said Trotsky in the same language.<br/><br/>"What exactly brings you here?" said Diego.<br/><br/>"We're visiting everyone I know in Mexico, then making our way down to South America."<br/><br/>"Well...I guess you can stay for a while. What hotel are you at?"<br/><br/>"Actually, we just arrived, and haven't found a place."<br/><br/>"Oh."<br/><br/>"It's just been so entertaining, and so busy, we haven't had a chance..."<br/><br/>"Perhaps we could find a comrade to help you out."<br/><br/>"I wouldn't want to impose."<br/><br/>"No, not any imposition at all. After all, a comrade should want to help out the Party. As should we all. Help out the Party. You know what I mean."<br/><br/>Geronimo gently nudged Ruby. "Oh, of course. Let me just dig out my checkbook," she said.<br/><br/>"Your accountant must have a heart attack a week," muttered Jimmy.<br/><br/>They holed up for a while with Frieda Kahlo and Trotsky. Geronimo went out to find a church and sat through Mass and went to Confession.<br/><br/><i>[Me: The priest starts to cry...]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy smoked in the corner while absently running his rabbit's foot through his hands. He drank a brandy slowly, deep in thought.<br/><br/>Suddenly he sat up. "Janet's still at the hotel," he said, and rushed for the door.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Jimmy drove faster than he should have through the streets of Coyoac\xe1n. He parked a few blocks from the hotel and then casually sauntered past the front door of it.<br/><br/>A couple of guys were sitting in the lobby, obviously packing.<br/><br/>Jimmy whistled nonchalantly and swung down an alley. He walked halfway down it, then jumped up and grabbed the railing of a balcony. He swung himself up and climbed to the roof. Scurrying over the ridgepole, he slid down the other side and jumped the alley to the roof of the hotel. He worked his way across the balconies until he reached Janet's room.<br/><br/>"Jimmy, what are you doing out there?" said Janet when she saw him.<br/><br/>"I didn't like the look of the lobby. Don't worry, we're not going the way I came."<br/><br/>"How are we going to get out?"<br/><br/>"There's always a back door."<br/><br/>Janet grabbed a bag and they slipped into the hallway. Jimmy led them to the maid's room and then down the back stairs. They slipped out the door to the street. Jimmy jammed the door shut behind them with his penknife.<br/><br/>"Isn't that the fire door?" said Janet.<br/><br/>"Let's hope nobody smokes in bed." <br/><br/>As they walked down the street, they saw a police car pull up in front of the hotel. Some detectives came out of it, holding what was obviously a warrant, and a picture of Jimmy.<br/><br/><i>[I was experimenting with the Heat rules from NBA this session; JP made a Disguise check to beat the TN 5 Heat.

They hit the bar in that awkward hour where most of the locals had drifted out but the ex-pats hadn't drifted in yet. Behind the bar was a man whose arms and chest were covered with tattoos.<br/><br/>"Welcome, my fine <i>norteamericanos</i>," he said in English. "My name is Tonio."<br/><br/>"We're here to meet Javier Luna, we've heard so many good things about their music," said Ruby with a finely judged amount of enthusiasm.<br/><br/>"Oh, they don't come around as much as they used to. Maybe they'll show up tonight, maybe not. Good guys, though."<br/><br/>In a corner was a young woman who was reading a copy of <i>Tropic of Cancer </i>in English. Jimmy sidled up to her. "What's the PTI?" he said, pointing to a stack of pamphlets next to her.<br/><br/>"<i>Parti de Trabajadores Internac\xedonal</i>," she said absently. She glanced up, and then put her book down. "Americans!" she said with delight.<br/><br/>"Someone who speaks English!" said Jimmy with relief. "Mind if I sit down?"<br/><br/>"Be my guest."<br/><br/>Jimmy ordered a couple of tequilas for them. "Jimmy Wright," he said by way of introduction.<br/><br/>"Elena Alcatruz."<br/><br/>"You sit here a lot?"<br/><br/>"Yes, during the day it is not very loud, so it's a good place to write."<br/><br/>"What do you write?"<br/><br/>"I'm a poet. I also take photographs and play music."<br/><br/>"I used to be a photographer," said Jimmy, and engaged her for a few moments in pleasant conversation. "You know the Luna brothers?" he said after a while.<br/><br/>"Oh, sure. Actually, funny you should mention them, they're playing at our rally."<br/><br/>She handed Jimmy a flyer with a Socialist Realist picture of workers striving together. "<i>Gran manifestacion para...L\xe9on Trotsky</i>? What is that, some kind of rally?"<br/><br/>"I helped design it for Mr. Brooks," said Elena proudly. "He's a very interesting man. Very educated. He's from the U. S. but he loves Mexico, wants to help us through off the oppression of the evil clericists and capitalists. If you want me to introduce you to Javier, I can, but you should come to the rally--Senor Brooks is coming!"<br/><br/>"I'll definitely be there," said Jimmy. "And I'd love to see this Brooks."<br/><br/>"They call him the John Reed of Mexico," said Elena. "Well, at least <i>he</i> says that he's the John Reed of Mexico."<br/><br/>"This kind of opportunity comes only once a century," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"<i>Si</i>, Comrade Trotsky is a great man."<br/><br/>"You ever meet Leticia de la Luz?"<br/><br/>"I've heard her music. I didn't like it, because first it's extremely derivative and counter-revolutionary with a very bourgeois sensibility. Also, it's kinda creepy. A little crass, don't you think? Whenever I hear it, I do this old Indian trick my mother taught me. It's a song in Nahuatl, you know, the language of the Aztecs. Whenever I hear Leticia sing I sing that song to myself and it drives it out of my head."<br/><br/>"I'd love to hear it," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Oh, I don't know...it's a family thing..."<br/><br/>"I know, but I'd really love to hear you sing it. I'm sure you have a really beautiful voice."<br/><br/>"Oh," said Elena, blushing. "Well...it starts like this..."<br/><br/>She pulled up closer to Jimmy and whispered the song in his ear.<br/><br/><i>[This is a 2-point Flattery spend according to the book to get the song; but here I saw that a rich, intelligent American was spending two points of Flattery on a 22 year old Mexican woman...so Jimmy picked up a crush.]</i><br/><br/>"The truth is," said Elena after she finished teaching Jimmy the song, "most people are pretty scared of Leticia. Nobody sees her, and nobody wants to, even if they could find her. Senor Brooks doesn't let her out anymore. It's very strange, because she used to always be at her side. I think he was trying to model themselves on Diego and Frieda--Brooks is a great man, but he's not an artist. Trust me, he's not an artist."<br/><br/>"Politics and art don't often mix."<br/><br/>"True. You know, I'm going to be going to school soon--I have some money saved. I haven't decided if I'll stay here and go to the Autonomous University, or Paris, or America. But I do know that I'll be able to find other young women like myself."<br/><br/>Jimmy held his breath. "How's that?" he said through clenched teeth.<br/><br/>"I got this lovely letter from an organization that I can join. They gave me this gold pin, I wear it on my necklace." She pulled the necklace out from under her blouse.<br/><br/>"Those are Greek letters."<br/><br/>"Yes, an Epsilon and a Sigma superimposed on each other."<br/><br/>"I went to five or six of the best schools in the United States, so I'd be happy to tell you about them," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"That would be great!" Elena finished her drink. "So, do you want to get out this place with me? I know a few places nearby where we could be private."<br/><br/><i>[RP: Jimmy, I think you're gonna need to make an Athletics spend...]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>"The horrible breath the attacker had," said Ruby to an admiring coterie of deadbeat aristocrats, threadbare artists, and international drunks.

"We sort of rotate jobs around whoever's here, man," she said. "You're on dishwashing duty."<br/><br/>"Geronimo," whispered Ruby, "how do you wash dishes?"<br/><br/>"Soap and water."<br/><br/>"Soap from the bathroom?"<br/><br/>"No, the kitchen."<br/><br/>"There's <i>kitchen</i> soap?"<br/><br/>"Come on, this will be your chance to experience the life of the locals."<br/><br/>"I don't want to experience the life of the locals," whined Ruby. "They're poor."<br/><br/><br/><br/>The next day they swung down by Brooks' apartment building, driving by it a couple of times before casing it from the street. It was a modern seven-story apartment building, the kind that had floor-through apartments that opened directly on the elevator.<br/><br/>Dr. Orange shrugged into some overalls. "I'll go see if I can get access to the building," he said. He grabbed a toolbox and sauntered up to the lobby.<br/><br/>"I'm here to see the meter," he said to the concierge. At least, he hoped that's what he had said; Geronimo had tried to coach him.<br/><br/>"<i>Tienes un permiso de trabajador?"</i> said the concierge.<br/><br/>"Habla Ingles?"<br/><br/>"Yes, I speak English. You are an electrician?"<br/><br/>"Yes, this is the kind of work I can get. It's not the university work I'm used to..."<br/><br/>"Well, if you can't do an honest day's work, your honor..."<br/><br/>"Look, they just sent me over to look at the meter, they said something's wrong."<br/><br/>"I'll unlock the door to the basement. If you steal anything, I'll call the cops."<br/><br/><i>[We had JP make a disguise roll retroactively for the Doc to make sure his coveralls looked correct.]</i><br/><br/>Once he was in the basement, Dr. Orange went to the service entrance in the back of the room and jammed the lock. The elevator ran all the way down into the basement, but the door for it was locked. <i>Have to find a way to distract the concierge</i>, he thought to himself, <i>he'll be able to see it head to the basement</i>.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"A distraction," said Jimmy when Dr. Orange returned to the car and explained what he had done in the basement. "Let's pay some kids to kick a soccer ball into the lobby."<br/><br/>"That's it?" said Ruby, incredulously.<br/><br/>"Sure."<br/><br/>"I just figured...there would be explosives or something in there."<br/><br/>"What?"<br/><br/>"Nevermind, I'll go bribe some children. I've really headed down a bad road," she muttered to herself.<br/><br/>A few minutes later they crept down the service entrance and waited for the sound of the concierge screaming at the children Ruby had paid off. The elevator wasn't locked in any <i>serious</i> way, and soon they were running up to the seventh floor.<br/><br/><i>[I charged a couple of points of Stealth to handle sneaking down the alley.]</i><br/><br/>A little attention from Jimmy's prybar let them step into Brooks' penthouse. The first thing they saw was an enormous Socialist Realist painting of Brooks, Lenin, and Marx.<br/><br/>"Classy," muttered Jimmy.<br/><br/>The painting was on the far wall of a tastefully appointed and very modern living room with a sunken floor space for a seating area. Dr. Orange noticed that there was an excellent console radio with multiple turntables so that music could be played continuously.<br/><br/>The carpet had several orange stains that Ruby immediately recognized as Nectar.<br/><br/>"Place seems deserted," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>From the kitchen, Dr. Orange was able to estimate that nobody had been around for about two weeks, based on the mold growth on an old loaf of bread he found.<br/><br/><i>[Biology use by OP.]</i><br/><br/>In the bathroom, Ruby found a clear liquid that based on prior experience she realized was probably some kind of knockout drug.<br/><br/>Out on the patio, Jimmy found some bird coops. "Don't feed the birds," he called out, as he looked closer at them. A large feed bag had the tell-tale scent of Nectar lingering over it.<br/><br/>Outside the bird coop, Jimmy found some human finger bones.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448231/#Comment_448231" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-26T15:31:12+00:00" title="August 26, 2015  3:31PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode V: Lawyers, Guns, and Money (Part 8)</b><br/><br/>"Herr doktor," he called out. "What kind of bird are these feathers from?"<br/><br/>"How strange," said Dr. Orange. "This one is from a common grackle. But this is from a songbird, the redfooted blackbird."<br/><br/><i>[1-pt. Biology spend by OP.]</i><br/><br/>"And someone has tried putting some kind of magic symbols on the coops," said Jimmy. "Classy." He shook his head and walked to the corner of the patio.<br/><br/>"Kind of strange that there's a blank wall over here," he said. "Looks like someone bricked up a window. And...wait, are those <i>hinges</i>?"<br/><br/><i>[Architecture use by JP.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy started to push against the wall. He felt it move slightly. "Doc, get over here. It's some kind of secret door."<br/><br/>Dr. Orange studied the wall for a moment. "Amateurs," he said. "The Nazis would find the latch in thirty seconds." He took a penknife out of his pocket and fiddled at one edge of the wall. There was a snapping sound, and an entire section of the wall swung inward on hinges.<br/><br/>The first thing the light caught was a stone idol of a hideous creature like a winged toad, carved in an ancient Mesoamerican style. As Jimmy and the others walked inside, they quickly realized that this was some kind of combination office and shrine to the idol.<br/><br/>"Looks like he bricked up the study," said Jimmy. "Brooks is definitely one of <i>those guys</i>. Amateur theatrics."<br/><br/>He found a desk against one wall and began to turn through the papers on it. "Looks like there's a partially burned letter to 'SS'," he said, and read some of it out loud:<br/><br/><i>We have different aims, you and I, but we both share that in common...we have new songs coming, do you want me to send you? Our newest is right up your...I have dispatched men...ancient site...</i><br/><br/>Jimmy turned over some other partially burned scraps, this one a letter to 'T', presumably Trammel:<br/><br/><i>I know you are unhappy with my performance. I hear nightly what it truly wants and it is not what YOU say! It is not the only Liar among us, and perhaps not the worst!...I'll know for certain what it wants, this great Liar of yours...Echevarria knew more than he told us...does the name Golxumel mean anything to you?</i><br/><br/>Ruby took a look at the altar the idol was perched on. "Oh, I know this, it's probably Mayan...although maybe not <i>exactly</i> Mayan. Some related culture."<br/><br/><i>[Art History use by RP.]</i><br/><br/>"Those glyphs," said Dr. Orange. I recognize those. 'Mouth', 'Light', 'Song', 'Change', 'Transformation', 'Becoming'...Jimmy, did you say <i>Golxumel</i> before? I know that name. He was one of the "forbidden" gods of the Mayans...maybe one of the Lords of the Night. He had a cult in the Yucatan centered on a lost city called Chichen Xoxul."<br/><br/>Geronimo found a small piece of a letter in the corner. "You were right about Echevarria," it read. "It all comes down to M\xe9rida."<br/><br/>"What's M\xe9rida?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"A city in Extremadura, in Spain. A lot of the conquistadores came from there. They named several cities in the Spanish colonies after it. And sometimes it's a woman's name."<br/><br/>"Let's destroy that <i>thing</i>," said Dr. Orange, pointing at the idol with a shudder. "The four of us can carry it to the edge of the building and toss it over. And it might make a good distraction."<br/><br/>"Jimmy," said Ruby, "You've been dealing with the strange and the macabre for a while. If we destroy the idol of a strange and forbidding god, what are the ramifications?"<br/><br/>"Depends on the god," said Jimmy. "Some of them don't really care, they have so many idols. This statue doesn't seem to have an <i>power</i> per se. But I really only knew one of these gods, and he could swing either way--he might find it terribly amusing."<br/><br/><i>[Jimmy still has Nyarlathotep's "card" from the last campaign, so I pointed out that Jimmy could call him up to find out. JP demurred.]</i><br/><br/>From outside they could hear the sound of sirens. "Come on Ruby, help me out," said Dr. Orange. Together the two of them lifted the idol up and groaning, walked it to the edge of the building. <br/><br/>"It takes a suprisingly long time for something like that to fall," said Ruby as they dropped it over the edge.<br/><br/><i>[I know from experience, having once dropped an AC out of a third story window.

As the doors open, they saw the concierge coming back in from the lot behind the building where the idol had landed. "Hey!" he shouted, as the four of them sprinted out the front of the building.<br/><br/>They hit the street just as a police car turned the corner. It pulled up in front of the building. A cop jumped out and turned to see the four of them vanishing around the corner just as the concierge pointed them out.<br/><br/>When they reached the car, Ruby tried to get in on the driver's side but Geronimo shoved her aside. He floored it and wove in and out of traffic at a breakneck speed, managing to evade the second police car that pulled up to the building.<br/><br/><i>[So! Here's a nice example of piggybacking. They used Fleeing to get out of the building, with Jimmy making the roll. Geronimo could piggyback on it, but Ruby didn't have any and Dr. Orange was out of points to spend. So the TN was: 4 + 2/PC unable to piggyback=8. GP spent one point to piggyback, and one point to help JP, who spent 5 points; and so they needed a 2 and rolled a 4 to get away. Geronimo made a simple test using Driving--I could have made it a contest, but they basically had the momentum and I didn't want this to be a major inflection point of the session.</i><br/><i>Around here they all went to ground to refresh their daily pools, which led to this exchange:</i><br/><br/><i>JP: My Athletics is back to 10.</i><br/><i>Me: Wait, you have high Athletics AND Disguise? </i><br/><i>RP: And a teenaged ward.

It was easy to find--they just walked towards the square festooned with red banners, pictures of Lenin and Trotsky, and a suspiciously high number of probable secret policemen.<br/><br/>Elena Alcatruz found Jimmy almost immediately. "I was hoping to see you at the bar last night..."<br/><br/>Jimmy gulped. "I wanted to but I got held up by work."<br/><br/>"Oh, work...well, we're here at a worker's rally! Come let me get you some punch."<br/><br/><i>Don't drink the punch!</i> mouthed Geronimo.<br/><br/>Jimmy took the glass that Elena offered him. He nervously took the tiniest sip possible. "Cheers," he said, smiling wanly.<br/><br/><i>[Honestly, I should have charged people Stability to stand in the middle of an open square under the noonday Mexican sun and NOT drink a cold glass of punch, meta be damned.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy made his excuses right after that and he Geronimo and Ruby went in search of Javier Luna. They found a bunch of musicians smoking joints behind the open-air stage.<br/><br/>"Let me have a puff," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>It was pretty clear that only one of Sus Hermanos was in fact Javier Luna's brother. Ruby approached them gushing admiration. "I've heard so much about you," she purred.<br/><br/>"Really?" said Javier. "Where did you do that?"<br/><br/>"At that bar, La Paz."<br/><br/>"Whoa, <i>blancas ricas</i> are coming there now? We have to start playing there again."<br/><br/><i>[Flattery use by RP.]</i><br/><br/>Ruby smiled slinkily as the band pressed closer to her. "So you're here playing for Brooks now. I didn't think you were his kind of band."<br/><br/>"Oh, he's so crazy! He's obsessed with this next album, says it's going to change the world! He was going to send it up to Los Angeles, but now he says he's got bigger things in mind."<br/><br/>"Europe?"<br/><br/>"Who knows? He's really excited about meeting Senor Trotsky. His people are all crazy, you know. They're like a cult, they all take that Nectar."<br/><br/>"Oh, really? They have it up in the States too."<br/><br/>"Yeah, it makes you feel good, maybe too good. We still play for Leticia. She must have had some plastic surgery, she's always wearing a veil. Should have gone up to California, I hear they all get that done there."<br/><br/>"No that's a dirty lie," said Ruby, self-consciously fingering her nose. "What kind of music do you play for her?"<br/><br/>"Some kind of weird jazz, I guess. Like, something based on the Internationale? And other...weirder stuff."<br/><br/>"Do you know where you were recording?"<br/><br/>Luna and the rest of the band looked around quickly. "They always keep us blindfolded," muttered Luna.<br/><br/>Geronimo scowled and crossed his arms. "It would be beneficial," he hissed, "to tell us what you know."<br/><br/><i>[2-point Intimidation spend by GP.]</i><br/><br/>"Look, maybe you <i>might</i> kill us, but Brooks will <i>definitely</i> kill us..."<br/><br/>Geronimo glared.<br/><br/>"Okay, okay, we think it's at an old villa on Moctezuma and San Pedro. It's all run into the ground. I think they bought the house next door and tunneled below it, because the studio is in the basement or underground."<br/><br/>"Very well. You may play tonight," said Geronimo.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Dr. Orange went off in search of Trotsky. He finally saw Lev Davidovich and a tall American-looking man duck into a tent. He pushed through the crowd and came in through the tent flap to discover Trotsky and the American having a heated argument in French.<br/><br/><i>"Non</i>," said Trotsky, "<i>non, monsieur, ce que vous direz est illegal, immoral et irrationnel!

"I'm sorry for interrupting. I'm a German comrade, Klaus."<br/><br/>"Not Julius? I thought Comrade Trotsky--"<br/><br/>"No, it's Klaus. We only spoke that one time at Diego Rivera's house."<br/><br/>"Ah, Rivera. He's not a <i>real</i> Socialist."<br/><br/>"I don't know what that means."<br/><br/>"He's too caught up in his artistic endeavors. The real revolution isn't going to come from people running around willy-nilly with their heads cut off. If anything has been proven to us, it is that we must all come together in a spirit of solidarity and single purpose."<br/><br/>"I agree. In fact, in my home country, it was the disagreements between Communists and Socialists that created the rift for us both to be subjugated."<br/><br/>"It is unfortunate. There are no comrades like Rosa Luxemburg or Carl Liebknecht anymore. Even you have fled your country...I was in Germany in 1919, when we were raising the red flag over the cities...it was a beautiful moment. But now an ugly red flag waves in its place. Comrade Klaus, perhaps you would like to speak on the situation in Germany? There have been connections between Mexico and Germany for many years, a great tradition of cooperation between our countries."<br/><br/>"Absolutely."<br/><br/>"Why don't you come with me and we'll help you prepare."<br/><br/>"Prepare?"<br/><br/>"Well, I just want to keep you with the rest of the speakers. Please, come with me."<br/><br/>Brooks led Trotsky and Dr. Orange behind the stage. The other speakers looked like locals; most seemed uncomfortable, either at the idea of speaking in public or at speaking to this crowd. Trotsky sat down on a stool one of his bodyguards offered.<br/><br/>"You know, <i>Klaus</i>," he said to Dr. Orange, "I...fear for the Revolution."<br/><br/>"Why is that?"<br/><br/>"Everywhere we look the forces of evil and oppression become stronger and stronger. America, which should be on the side of the workers, is lost in some capitalist nightmare!"<br/><br/>"It's really sad...the capitalists and the money interests are just so strong. I don't know what we can do without solidarity."<br/><br/>"It's not like the old days when Vladimir Ilyich and I thought we could change the world in a single night. Now...a monster oppresses my country, a monster oppresses your country."<br/><br/>"One night is great, but it takes so much to continue, so much that we don't have."<br/><br/>"Ah, well. Our children, they will succeed where we have failed."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>"Is that <i>Herr Doktor</i>?" said Ruby as a familiar German-accented voice came over the PA. <br/><br/>"What is he doing up there?" said Geronimo, pointing at the stage.<br/><br/>In the harsh tropical sunlight, Dr. Orange gulped. "My friends...we must flee the horrible dictators...but there is resistance! The Workers will rise again..."<br/><br/>The last line got some nice applause. Dr. Orange finished with some anodyne commentary and then was quickly hustled away as Trotsky and Brooks himself walked out.<br/><br/>From the crowd, Jimmy could see now why Brooks was not as ridiculous in person as his posters and writing made him out to be. He seemed to blossom in the gaze of the spectators, using his personal attractiveness and excellent speaking voice to create a magnetic spell.<br/><br/>"Comrades!" he said. "We are gathered together as workers and revolutionaries in the spirit of Emilio Zapata and the other martyrs of Mexican freedom, as well as our comrades who have gone before us, in Russia, in France, in Germany, and even in the United States. It is no small accomplishment to still be standing in the face of the determination of the capitalists and their executioners. But simple solidarity will not be enough. Simple determination will not be enough. Today I will demonstrate something to you, in the presence of our beloved Comrade Trotsky. I will show you how true <i>unanimity</i> <i>of purpose </i>can be achieved. Gentlemen, play!"<br/><br/>From the speakers came an eerie, droning music, with a woman's voice singing nonsense words about mouths and love. Jimmy clutched his ears. The song seemed to bore into his skull, trying to blank his mind, to leave him mindlessly waiting for orders...he dug deep into his last reserves of stubbornness. <i>Not going to listen</i>, he thought desperately. <i>It's a drug, the punch was drugged with Nectar!</i><br/><br/><i>[TN 5 Stability Test for Jimmy to resist Brooks' domination.]</i><br/><br/>Around the square most people were straightening up and standing with a patient, expectant look on their faces. "Comrades!" boomed Brooks. "First, round up the interlopers! All those who hear my voice, look around you! You will see those who do not hear me! They are the tools of the secret police and the capitalists."<br/><br/>Ruby and Geronimo exchanged a furtive glance and then stood as straight as possible, trying to keep their faces slack and blank.<br/><br/>On the stage, Brooks' men were surrounding Trotsky and his bodyguards. Konovalev bounced up onto the stage with a couple of his thugs. Thinking quickly, Dr. Orange drew up next to Trotsky, pulled his pistol, and held it to the elderly Russian's head.<br/><br/>"What are you doing?" he hissed.<br/><br/>"Just go with it!" said Julius.<br/><br/>"Stop! Put that weapon down!" shouted Brooks at Julius.<br/><br/>"Let me go or I'll kill him!"<br/><br/>Konovalev shrugged. "It matters not to me. I was sent here to kill him anyway. Go ahead, shoot. He's a traitor."<br/><br/>Brooks turned on his bodyguard with a snarl. "You will not harm a hair on his head," he said. Konovalev responded with a stream of Russian invective. In the confusion, Trotsky and his bodyguards were able to duck down behind some crates.<br/><br/>"<i>Monsieur le docteur</i>," said Trotsky to Dr. Orange, "next time you hold a gun to my a head a little warning would be appreciated."<br/><br/>Konovalev pushed Brooks down. "Shut up you silly poseur," he said. He barked out, "Get Trotsky and the German!" to his men and drew his pistol.<br/><br/>"We need to run!" said Dr. Orange, grabbing Trotsky's hand and pulling him away.<br/><br/>"Have pity," huffed the Russian.

As he approached, he saw her pull a small knife from her purse and look around with a hateful look in her eyes.<br/><br/>On the stage, Brooks straightened up and waved at his bodyguards. "Protect Lev Davidovich," he said. He grabbed the microphone. "All who can hear me! Go! Burn down Coyoac\xe1n!"<br/><br/>Clumps of people began to break out of the crowd, screaming wordlessly and streaming out into the street.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Dr. Orange and Trotsky ducked behind the speakers. "<i>\xc7a, ce n'est pas peculier,</i>" muttered Trotsky as Dr. Orange frantically traced power cables. "Aha!" the German crowed, and he pulled out a heavy voltage plug and then threw several levers on a circuit board to the left.<br/><br/>There was a smell of ozone and some pops from the equipment, but the music abruptly cut off. In the sudden silence, the boom of Konovalev's pistol sounded like thunder. Dr. Orange quickly ducked back down behind the speakers.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Elena turned away from Jimmy and began to run with the rest of the crowd towards the streets of Coyoac\xe1n. With only a fraction of a second to act, Jimmy pulled his heavy .45 and cracked her on the back of the neck with the barrel. Elena fell heavily and lay crumpled on the ground, blood already beginning to pool around her head.<br/><br/><i>[So, a Weapons attack from JP did something like 5 points of damage; since Joe Schmoe humans have about 1 Health, Elena was immediately Hurt and in serious need of assistance.]</i><br/><br/>Out in the plaza, Ruby pulled a heavy automatic pistol out of her purse and fired a couple of quick shots at Konvalev. At the sound of the shots, the Russian waved to a couple of his bodyguards who opened up on the plaza with Thompsons.<br/><br/><i>[RP: I hate Thompsons.]</i><br/><br/>Ruby hit the deck and crawled over to a table Geronimo had overturned to provide some cover. Bullets whined and ricocheted off the stones of the plaza. In the confusion, Dr. Orange took careful aim at Konovalev and squeezed off a shot. The bullet grazed his arm, but he fired back at Dr. Orange, who had to flatten himself to the ground.<br/><br/>Geronimo popped over the edge of the table and fired several rounds at Konovalev. One of the Thompson gunners threw a hail of lead back at him.<br/><br/><i>[Folks were taking a lot of damage here, which makes sense because they were in an open space and facing guys with automatic weapons. Of course, I also rolled a lot of fives and sixes.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy swept Elena up in a fireman's carry and rushed back to his car. He laid her gently on the back seat, then yanked open the glove compartment and pulled out an extra .45. He ducked out behind the hood of the car and put a round into Konovalev's shoulder.<br/><br/>The Russian dropped behind a crate on the stage and fired another shot at Dr. Orange. "We need to get out of here!" sputtered Julius to Trotsky. Keeping low, the two socialists evaded gunfire and vanished into the labyrinth of streets surrounding the square.<br/><br/>Geronimo braced himself and shot at the crate Konovalev was crouching behind. There was a satisfying thud as the big Russian fell to the ground when his shot hit home. The two Thompson gunners raked the square with gunfire again, and Geronimo heard a muffled shriek from next to him as Ruby took a bullet in the arm.<br/><br/>Jimmy jumped up onto the hood of the car and fired off several rounds at the two men with Thompsons. One grimaced as a bullet grazed him, but they kept advancing slowly, intent on finishing off Ruby and Geronimo.<br/><br/><i>[Normally, I'd have the gunners probably break and flee before things got to this point, but these were crazed Nectar Cultists, so they kept fighting until they went unconscious.]</i><br/><br/>Geronimo desperately fired off a few rounds, but the Thompson gunners kept coming. He was thrown back as a bullet slammed into his upper arm.<br/><br/>Jimmy shouted and vaulted from the hood of the car into the square. He raced forward, dodging gunfire, and firing his pistols back until they both clicked on empty. The Thompson gunners swiveled towards him and fired a nervous burst as he fell upon them.<br/><br/>Geronimo felt Ruby's hands on his arm, wrapping a scarf over his wound. He took her hands in his own, and then tore off a piece of the scarf and wrapped it around her arm. They looked into each other's eyes, knowing that it might be the last thing they do.<br/><br/>Jimmy and the gunners screamed as they crashed together. One tried to bring his gun up to bear on the private eye, but Jimmy wrenched it down with one hand and clocked him with the pistol in his other hand. He threw a kick backwards at the other gunner, who made a satisfying groan as Jimmy's foot buried itself in his solar plexus.<br/><br/>Jimmy cocked his arm back to strike again, but suddenly his target crumpled to the ground. Ruby was standing behind him, with a bloody set of brass knuckles in her hand.<br/><br/>"I accessorize well," she said.<br/><br/><i>[Preparedness roll for RP.]</i><br/><br/>There was a growl from behind her, and Geronimo threw himself onto the remaining cultist. The Spaniard's gun barrel smashed into the other man's head with a gruesome crack. Geronimo threw the man to the ground and stood breathing heavily and covered with blood above his body.<br/><br/>Jimmy broke the silence first. "We need to get the girl to a hospital."<br/><br/>"Where's Dr. Orange?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Over there by the car," said Geronimo. The three of them trotted up to the sedan and piled inside.<br/><br/>They pulled out into the streets. Smoke was filling the sky, and they could hear the sirens of fire engines racing into Coyoac\xe1n. Dr. Orange frantically tried to stop Elena's bleeding, but he could see that she had a skull fracture.<br/><br/>"She needs a hospital!" he called out to Jimmy.<br/><br/>"The cops will be waiting for us at a hospital," warned Geronimo.<br/><br/>Jimmy cursed and swung the car heavily around a corner. "There's some kind of People's Clinic up ahead, I think we might be able to make it."<br/><br/>But when he pulled up across from it, he could see several Federales standing outside. "Geronimo, get them out of here," said Jimmy. He stepped out of the car, pulled Elena into his arms, and started walking towards the clinic.<br/><br/>As Geronimo pulled away, he could see Jimmy dropping to his knees with his hands on his head as the police raced up to him with guns drawn.<br/><br/><i>[So this was "worse outcome" type thing for me when Jimmy failed the Heat roll; basically, you can get Elena to the hospital to keep her from dying, but you\u2019ll be arrested when you do.]</i><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448262/#Comment_448262" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-28T14:58:55+00:00" title="August 28, 2015  2:58PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2015 2:59PM by Aviatrix.">edited August 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VI: Woodrow Wilson's Guns (Part 1)</b><br/><br/>Millicent and Betty were walking out of a small art gallery in the Zocalo when they heard people shouting about the riots in Coyoacan. They hurried back to the hotel, but Millicent grabbed Betty's arm as they approached it.<br/><br/>"That crossed out chalk mark," she said, pointing at a odd looking glyph sketched on a wall. "That's a sign from Mr. Wright. The hotel's been burned."<br/><br/>"I gotta place we can hide out for a while," said Betty. "I made a list of them for an occasion like this."<br/><br/>They hurried off into the teeming streets. \n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Ruby and Geronimo limped back into the commune, having seen Dr. Orange and Trotsky off; the Russian planned to lie low outside the city for a while.<br/><br/>"Lie down," said Geronimo to Ruby, gently putting her on a kitchen table. "The bullet went through your arm, but I have to clean it up."<br/><br/>There was a clatter from the courtyard. Geronimo furtively shot a glance out of the window. A crowd of wounded refugees from the riot was assembling there.<br/><br/>He stepped out of the house. "Why are you here?" he said quietly in Spanish.<br/><br/>"Please, senor...the people here have always tried to help us," said an old man. "We have many people who need assistance."<br/><br/>Geronimo sighed, and lit a cigarette. "Bring them inside," he said. He glanced around. "Start with the woman who is in labor."<br/><br/><i>[So, here's an attempt by me to start creating some more interesting moral situations.

Somewhat to his surprise, he was treated...professionally. Nobody beat him, and he was left to cool his heels in an interrogation room.<br/><br/>On one wall were several pictures of men in uniform that he guessed were of former officers at the station. He idly glanced at each of them until he saw a face that made his blood run cold--a handsome man in his twenties, wearing an older style uniform. Under it was a plaque with the name of the officer:<br/><br/><i>Coronel Ramon Echevarr\xeda</i><br/><br/>"Excuse me!" he shouted in English, hoping to get the attention of a guard.<br/><br/><i>[Me: Right, Spanish isn't one of your languages.</i><br/><i>JP: Jimmy speaks no languages!</i><br/><i>Me: Wait, you </i>literally went around the world<i>, and you never learned any other languages?</i><br/><i>JP: It's part of his shtick!</i><br/><i>Me: Dr. Mwimbe spoke four different languages </i>in her house!<i>]</i><br/><br/>Eventually a cop and a detective came in to speak with him. "Mr. Wright," said the detective wearily, "why do you come down to my country and start riots and fights and kill people?"<br/><br/>"Technically I was trying to prevent riots and protect people."<br/><br/>"You stink of cordite! You shot two men! We have witnesses!"<br/><br/>"They were shooting at me."<br/><br/>"And why would that be, Mr. Wright? Because you were in the company of an arch-Communist? Because the Los Angeles police department has a file on you as thick as a phone book? You are currently wanted in Los Angeles for the assault of a man whose house was <i>blown up</i>!"<br/><br/>Jimmy was silent.<br/><br/>"How do you respond to these charges, Mr. Wright?"<br/><br/>"It was all a misunderstanding. Lost in translation. As it were."<br/><br/>"Mr. Wright, I am a detective in the Polic\xeda Federal. I long ago lost my capacity for a sense of humor."<br/><br/>"Everything I have been dragged into, it was all with good intents."<br/><br/>"Tell us about the Communist Jonathon Brooks."<br/><br/>"I came to Mexico to investigate him."<br/><br/>"And of course you did the right thing and came to the police to inform us of this."<br/><br/>"You know how it is."<br/><br/>"No, I do not. Please inform me 'how it is.'"<br/><br/>"Cops. Private Eyes. It happens a lot."<br/><br/>"Yes, we have private investigators here in Mexico City as well. They are a low sort."<br/><br/>"So you can see how you don't always want to go to the police, because you try to help, and the next thing you know--you're in jail. How is the woman, by the way?"<br/><br/>"Ah, the young lady whose blood is all over your clothes? She is resting comfortably. She probably will make a recovery. She was hit very hard in the back of the head. Probably with a gun. Much like the one we recovered from you, with blood and hair on the barrel."<br/><br/>"I think I want to talk to my <i>abogado</i> now."<br/><br/><i>[JP made a Law spend here to get sprung from the station, though I'm sure there was some money exchanged as well.]</i><br/><br/>A few hours later, Jimmy and a coterie of lawyers were signing papers at the front desk. "This will get you released on your own recognizance," said one to him. "Fortunately the prosecutor owes me several favors. Which you now owe me."<br/><br/>Jimmy nodded.

"Excuse me," he said to the desk clerk. "There was a picture of a man in my interrogation room that I think I knew once. Echevarr\xeda, I think it was."<br/><br/>"Yes, Colonel Echevarr\xeda," said the clerk in a bored tone. "He was with the Polic\xeda during the Revolution. He was a very brave man.

"But I can't figure out who it is. They're good. Let's duck into that dance hall up ahead."<br/><br/>"Is this a good time to go dancing? We got a guy on our tail!"<br/><br/>"We can watch the door and see if we can tell who it is."<br/><br/>"Yeah, that's a good idea! Unless it's a Mexican guy, then we'll never be able to tell."<br/><br/>They found a likely looking place not far away and made their way through the entrance. The dance floor was in an open-air courtyard in the back. There was a spirited band playing waltzes and folk songs. A crowd of young men in beautifully worked shirts surrounded them almost immediately.<br/><br/>"What should we do, Millicent?" asked Betty.<br/><br/>"Dance?"<br/><br/>"OK!" Betty glanced around, and latched onto a nearby man who was drinking a beer. "You! C'mon, let's dance!"<br/><br/>"Que?" said the man, startled, as Betty dragged him out onto the dance floor.<br/><br/>"You know how to jitterbug?"\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Jimmy dropped by the hospital Elena was convalescing in. She was still unconscious but seemed out of the woods. He made arrangements for a private nurse, and then hit his dead drops.<br/><br/>At one, he found a note from Millicent acknowledging the hotel had been burned, and that she and Betty were being followed.<br/><br/>As he began to think about how to find them, a car pulled up next to him. The door flew open and Gonchi del Toro waved for him to get in. "Your girls are in trouble," he said. "Come on in."<br/><br/>Jimmy slid in and shut the door. "I guess my luck really is better now," he mused.<br/><br/>"I should have just taken your money," grumbled Gonchi as he threw the car into gear.<br/><br/>"You did take my money."<br/><br/>"Oh. Right."<br/><br/>As they pulled up to the dance hall, Jimmy rummaged into the back seat and pulled a clean shirt out of Gonchi's suitcase. "Good thing you were packed to leave," he said, pulling on the shirt.<br/><br/>Gonchi seemed to be counting silently to ten. "Your girls picked up a tail, and your dead drop's being watched. We probably have a tail now. The girls hit a dance hall up there, but they'll get cornered there. We have to hurry."<br/><br/>They parked the car and hurried into the hall. The girls didn't stand out like a sore thumb--they stood out like a sore thumb someone had painted red and tied a neon sign to. Betty was jitterbugging away despite the Latin music, and Millicent was trying to remember her paso doble steps from her long-ago dance classes.<br/><br/>"What is wrong with these girls," said Gonchi.<br/><br/>"They're girls."<br/><br/>"That's sexist, man. My mother's a girl."<br/><br/>"They're <i>young </i>girls."<br/><br/>"<i>Yo ni puedo</i>," muttered Gonchi.<br/><br/>"Just go grab that blonde girl."<br/><br/>"The one picking up that guy? I mean, literally?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>Gonchi ran out on the dance floor and grabbed Betty by the wrist. Barely missing a beat, she turned and decked him. <br/><br/>Jimmy hurried up. "Boss!" said Betty. "This guy was getting fresh with me!"<br/><br/>Gonchi moaned and rubbed his jaw.<br/><br/>Millicent ran up. "Mr. Wright! We should leave!"<br/><br/>"Yeah. One minute." Jimmy turned, pulled out his wallet, and tossed a bunch of bills in the air. "Come on," he said as people began to shriek and dive for the money.<br/><br/>They rushed through the kitchen, past the out of work American roughnecks who were working in it, and slipped down an alley and into the crowd.<br/><br/><i>[Stealth check by MP, with the other PCs and NPCs piggybacking.

Millicent helped Geronimo and Ruby do triage in the courtyard, at least until they all dropped from exhaustion after midnight.<br/><br/>Around dawn, Millicent woke up a stretched, trying to work out the kinks in her back she'd picked up from sleeping on the floor. She walked out into the courtyard and watched the sky get light. Nearby, Geronimo slept hunched over a table, his head nestled in his arms. A few birds were sitting on the ridgeline of the house. As she watched, several more came up in groups of three and four.<br/><br/>There seemed to be a lot more birds than normal.<br/><br/>"Mr. Cuevas!" she called out. Geronimo picked up his head and looked blearily at her.<br/><br/>As if on cue, the birds rose as one and swarmed at them.<br/><br/>"Run!" shouted Geronimo. He pulled Millicent toward the door as the birds swarmed around her. <br/><br/>"They don't have beaks!" shouted Millicent. The birds swirled around and came in for as second pass, their horrid mouths, filled with jagged misshapen teeth, wide open.<br/><br/>As Geronimo pushed Millicent through the door, several started to bite at his hands and face. He pulled the door shut behind him, bleeding from several cuts. The birds slammed into the door, and they could hear the sound of gnawing as they tried to eat through the door.<br/><br/>Jimmy rolled off the couch, and Ruby jumped up next to him. "We need an O'Donnell cocktail," he muttered. <br/><br/>"Would these work?" asked Ruby, holding out a couple of pine torches. "They had them in a box labeled 'Party Supplies'."<br/><br/><i>[Seeing the birds was a 4 point Stability loss, but Geronimo got back 2 points for fulfilling his Duty, and Ruby and Jimmy clawed back a point for following their drives. RP made a Preparedness roll to find torches.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy had just finished lighting the torches when the slats on the shutters over the windows collapsed and a dark cloud of screeching birds burst into the room.<br/><br/>Jimmy and Ruby waved the torches around and several of the birds dropped smoking to the floor.<br/><br/><i>[GP: You have anything that can help us, Jimmy?</i><br/><i>JP: Only Cthulhu Mythos...</i><br/><i>Me: I am really curious as to how a Cthulhu Mythos spend will help you out here.</i><br/><i>RP: I am curious as well.</i><br/><i>JP: I am curious as well, because I am trying to think about it exactly...</i><br/><i>Me: You don't know any spells--you forgot them.</i><br/><i>JP: I never knew any!</i><br/><i>Me: You knew that one at the end...</i><br/><br/><i>We negotiated an Outdoorsman use here to maybe reduce damage. I mentioned flipping blankets at them, and then we realized...]</i><br/><br/>Geronimo swept up a lace mantilla someone had draped over a chair. "Take this!" he shouted, tossing one end to Jimmy. They shook out the shawl and swept forward, catching the birds in the fine mesh of the scarf. Behind them Ruby swept the torch around, dropping another few birds. Several birds pushed their way forward, however, and bit Ruby in the face.<br/><br/><i>[Each point of Outdoorsman gave them 2d6 birds they could catch. We made this up on the spot; I hadn't prepped that.]</i><br/><br/>Millicent grabbed a torch and jabbed it at the birds as Jimmy and Geronimo pulled their improvised net closed. The few remaining birds broke as one and fled out the windows.<br/><br/>Jimmy and Geronimo beat the netted birds to death with the extinguished torches.<br/><br/>"Those birds...they must have been sent," gasped Jimmy. "If they didn't know where we were, they probably do now."<br/><br/>"I'll start packing," sighed Millicent.<br/><br/><i>[Me: No, no, you totally should have expected to be able to save the world while sitting in your office.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>With Gonchi's help, they laid low at a mob doctor's office to heal up and plan. <br/><br/>"We need guns," said Geronimo. "We can compensate you handsomely."<br/><br/>"What do you need?"<br/><br/>"Pistols. Rifles, shotguns. Explosives."<br/><br/>"Those...shouldn't be a problem."<br/><br/>"Thompson gun?"<br/><br/><i>[I've been using some custom rules to cover auto/rapid fire:</i><br/><br/><i>When you fire a gun quickly, hold +Ammo.

Someone who knows how he talks, can pretend to be a Communist, speak Spanish..."<br/><br/>Everyone looked at Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Can you do a Mexican accent?" said Milicent.<br/><br/>"Yes, I suppose I can pretend a cat pooped on my tongue," muttered Geronimo.<br/><br/>"We can say he's a comrade from Spain. Pancho or something," said Jimmy. <br/><br/>"Pancho!" said Geronimo.<br/><br/><i>[RP made some Flattery spends to give Geronimo a 1-pt Flattery pool...call them elocution lessons.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Jimmy staked out the intersection that Javier Luna had pegged as the place he and the band had been taken. After studying the area for a while, he decided that his most likely target was a pair of houses--a decrepit hacienda, and a modern house painted blue. Suspiciously, there always seemed to be two or three men at the blue house, watching the hacienda. On his way out, Jimmy walked by the fence around the hacienda. There was a padlocked door leading into the cellar of the building.<br/><br/><i>[Evidence Collection spend by JP.]</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448319/#Comment_448319" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-02T15:32:23+00:00" title="September  2, 2015  3:32PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VI: Woodrow Wilson's Guns (Part 4)</b><br/><br/>"This is Pancho, he's a comrade from Barcelona, he wants to join up," said Gonchi to the leader of a group of street fighters who were wearing red armbands.<br/><br/>"I have been driven away from my land," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"It's terrible what's going on there," said the leader. "Well, you can join our Red Brigades and fight on the streets tonight--the riots are still going on, and we're going to take the Revolution to the <i>cabrons</i>."<br/><br/>"I believe my skills will be more useful at the executive level," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"You want to speak to the First Secretary?"<br/><br/>"I wish to offer my services to Senor Brooks personally."<br/><br/>"Hrm...I know he's very interested in the war in Spain. Well, come on. Forgive me, comrade, but we're going to have to blindfold you."<br/><br/>"Of course. Very sensible."<br/><br/>He was led to a truck and had a bag slipped over his head. The frisking was thorough, but failed to turn up the gun taped between his shoulder blades or the knife strapped to his thigh. <i>Never thought having been searched by Germans would actually end up being useful</i>, he thought.<br/><br/>He was driven in circles for a long time before the truck stopped and he was led out into a building of some kind. He was taken down several flights of stairs. The air grew slightly colder, and he sensed he was underground.<br/><br/>When the bag was removed, he found himself in a recording studio that looked like it had been built in an old wine cellar. Jonathon Brooks was there and came up to shake his hand.<br/><br/>"Always a pleasure to meet a comrade from Spain," Brooks said.<br/><br/>"Yes. I am unable to return to my home while the Fascists are there."<br/><br/>"I understand what it is to be an exile, even it is one who exiled himself. You come on an auspicious night, but also a difficult one. It seems counter-revolutionaries are attempting to destroy our work here."<br/><br/>"I am sorry to have come at such a difficult time."<br/><br/>"Not at all, comrade, for tonight we shall light the true lamp of revolution. All who hear this call will be inflamed with the same desire that you and I have to overthrow the evil capitalists. Our names will go down in history!"<br/><br/>"You speak with such passion. It intrigues me. I wish to help in any way. I have many special skills."<br/><br/>"You understand the concept of the false consciousness that so many of the proletariat--who should be our natural allies--fall prey to? They believe the lies of the capitalists and the oppression they receive every day. But suppose I were to tell you that it is possible to override these emotions."<br/><br/>"How do you mean?"<br/><br/>"I have managed to discover a...substance, that in its weaker form makes people susceptible to hearing the call of true revolution. However, when the substance is purified over and over again, even a whiff of its scent is enough to make people open to any suggestion. Tonight, we hope to finish our radio mast, and my wife's music will be broadcast throughout the city. Those who are susceptible to it will awaken to its call and fight the capitalists, and we shall create a new Soviet, here, in Mexico!"<br/><br/><i>[RP: Susceptible...does that mean anyone who's taken Nectar?<br/>Me: Yes. They've been selling Nectar all around town.</i><br/><i>RP: I was more worried about if I heard it...</i><br/><i>Me: Yes....]</i><br/><br/>Brooks walked over to the mixing board and slapped a hand down on it. "I have no doubt, comrade," he said, warming to the subject, "that you will be there beside us when we raise the Red banner over the ruins of Tenochtitlan!"<br/><br/>"This weapon you say you have devised...it proves to me that you are not just dedicated to the cause, but one who has harnessed science to our needs!" said Geronimo. "It is quite brilliant."<br/><br/>"I know little of science," said Brooks smugly. "I am more of a romantic. Although some of my correspondents are quite educated in that line. Then again, one is an absolute idiot, consumed with the belief in some 'god'. While I know for a fact, comrade, that there are intelligences greater than our own--a fact predicted by science--I do think that if you're going to talk to one of them, you should know which one you are talking to! My colleague in Los Angeles is completely mistaken. He thinks he is talking to some, I don't know, witch-coven devil figure! No. I have scientific evidence that here, in Mexico itself, that a god--let us call it that, its capabilities are so far beyond our own as to make the comparison apt, although like you I believe in no supreme being--walks here in this country, and his cult still lives! These are all true things. And when we have completed our work in the Federal District, and raised the flag of revolution over all of Central America, I myself will visit this place. For the moment I have only been able to send a small expedition to prove the veracity of my theory."<br/><br/><i>[Brooks does love the sound of his own voice. And he's full of projection.]</i><br/><br/>Brooks poured himself a glass of wine and drained it. "Of course, we must also prepare ourselves, for I know the counter-revolutionaries are going to attack us tonight."<br/><br/>"I am amazed at the depth of your preparation," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Our organization has many contacts and arrangements with local groups."<br/><br/><i>[MP: ...and magical birds!]</i><br/><br/>"Excellent."<br/><br/>"Yes, an organization we are affiliated with has been watching them for some time. Why, I am sure that they are gathering outside as we speak."<br/><br/>The radio crackled and a familiar Georgian drawl came over the speaker. "Mr. Brooks, they're entering the hacienda now," said Bethany Mae Hampton.<br/><br/>"Very good," said Brooks. "Come in and help me manage the situation."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>At that moment Jimmy was showing Ruby and Millicent his rabbit foot as they waited outside the hacienda for a likely moment to infiltrate the grounds. "This burn mark is from when I fired off a flare gun at someone," he said, pointing to a scorched spot.<br/><br/>"How did the flare get the rabbit's foot?" asked Millicent.<br/><br/>"It happens when you're within ten feet of the target. These salt stains are from the Indian Ocean. And these burns are from when I was struck by a lightning gu....when I was struck by lightning." He looked up. "Come on, nobody's looking."<br/><br/><i>[JP took a Stability refresh scene.]</i><br/><br/>They crept across the open lot behind the hacienda. Jimmy made quick work of the padlock and they took a flight of stairs down deep under the surface. They came out in a darkened room. Beyond it lay a glassed in room, a recording studio of some kind.<br/><br/>Jimmy saw the glint of light on several pistols as they were leveled at him. He jumped back into the stairwell. Bullets ricocheted around the walls. From above he heard the sound of someone trying to force open the storm cellar doors.<br/><br/><i>Good thing I jammed the doors</i>, Jimmy thought.<br/><br/><i>[Preparedness roll by JP.]</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448332/#Comment_448332" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-03T20:04:08+00:00" title="September  3, 2015  8:04PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VI: Woodrow Wilson's Guns (Part 5)</b><br/><br/>Geronimo heard the sound of gunshots from beyond the studio. "Good," said Brooks. "They've arrived."<br/><br/>"Let me help you drive them off," said Geronimo. <i>I need to get out of here</i>, he thought, <i>before Bethany gets here and blows my cover.</i><br/><br/>"Though it is selfish of me and not befitting a true Communist, I'd like to keep you here. It's so rare that I have a chance to talk to an intelligent and dedicated comrade. However, I know your place is on the front line. I will stay here and coordinate. For Socialism!"<br/><br/>"For Communism!" said Geronimo, grabbing a pistol and dashing off.<br/><br/><i>[GP spent that Flattery point Ruby loaned him.]</i><br/><br/>He ran through the recording studio and slipped into the darkened room beyond it. Four men with pistols were crouched down behind crates. <br/><br/>"Brooks sent me," he said.<br/><br/>"Good," said one of the men. "We've got them pinned down, and those crazy gringos Senor Brooks is working with are going to come down the stairs. We have them!"\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>"Be back," said Jimmy. He jumped forward into a commando roll, popping up in the middle of the room firing his Thompson gun. Bullets ripped through the crates on his left. Two men shrieked in agony as the took slugs in their legs and stomachs, but they managed to get some shots off at Jimmy.<br/><br/>Geronimo dropped into shooter's stance and fired at the two men next to him. One man went down with a bullet in his head, but his companion managed to slip past him and sprinted for the recording studio.<br/><br/>Ruby clattered down the stairs and saw the man running for the studio. She fired a shot off but shattered a window on his left. Millicent came up next to her and fired off another round, shattering the window on his right.<br/><br/><i>[Actually, they both hit but for not enough damage to drop him.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy fired off a second burst at the last gunman on his left, ripping his chest apart.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>"We need to seal off that exit!" shouted Geronimo. "Bethany and her people are on their way!" He knelt down by the stairs to the surface and began planting some of the dynamite charges Ruby had been carrying.<br/><br/>Ruby fired off another round at the studio. Jimmy shoved her rifle barrel down. "Careful, that's load bearing," he said to Geronimo, pointing at the doorway.<br/><br/><i>[Architecture spend by JP to let Geronimo plant the charges quickly.]</i><br/><br/>Geronimo worked feverishly and then lit the fuse. "Run!" he shouted and they all hurried through the studio. There was a loud bang behind them, followed by the sound of masonry collapsing.<br/><br/>"That should hold them," said Geronimo, lighting a cigarette with shaking fingers.<br/><br/><i>[Assessed everyone 2 points of Stability except for Geronimo, who had the Military background and so only lost 1.]</i><br/><br/>They cautiously made their way into the sitting room. There was a closed door which they guessed hid a stairway to a lower floor. Ruby found Brooks' speech next to a microphone in the studio. "It's twenty pages long," she marveled.<br/><br/>"They're undoubtedly waiting for us down there," mused Jimmy.<br/><br/>Geronimo lit the fuse on another stick of dynamite, yanked open the door, and threw the stick down the stairs.<br/><br/><i>[Me: Sure, that will work...but just for fun, if you roll a natural 1, something horrible will happen.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy slammed the door shut. There was another loud bang which rattled the door in its frame, followed by some shrieks of pain.<br/><br/><i>[RP: I want to shoot that Anne woman (Bethany).</i><br/><i>JP: She attacked me with ninjas!</i><br/><br/><i>That was my chat status for a couple of weeks.]</i><br/><br/>They made their way down the stairs, guns drawn. At the bottom was some kind of storage room. Judging by the distribution of bodies, it looked like there had been two men standing on either side of the doorway at the end of the staircase. The dynamite had gone off right between them. One man was dead, two were unconscious, and one was moaning in agony, his legs shattered below the knees.<br/><br/>"You should put him out of his misery," said Geronimo to Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Why does it always have to be me?" said Jimmy, but he fired a shot into the wounded man's head.<br/><br/>The room was filled with crates. They opened a few with a crowbar. Inside each of them were dozens--maybe hundreds--of record albums. They were unlabeled, but it didn't take much to deduce that this was some of Leticia's music.<br/><br/>There was a whine of feedback and the metallic <i>click</i> of a public address system switching on.<br/><br/>"<i>Adios, gentlemen</i>," said Brooks' voice. "<i>But here's something my wife made, to sing you to your rest</i>."<br/><br/>An eerie, lilting woman's voice began to sing over the PA system. At the same time, in a <i>basso obligato</i>, came a deep voice from somewhere nearby, rich in subsonics, seeming to shake the very air.<br/><br/><i>[I called for a rare Stability </i>check<i> here rather than a fixed Stability loss. There was a moment of confusion while we sorted out what the effect of the earwax was, but Ruby and Millicent both ended up at 0 and came under the spell of Leticia and the Mouth.]</i><br/><br/>Millicent gave a shout out of hell and launched herself on Ruby. She was otherwise silent, of course--her Uncle Jack had told her to never say anything if she was there to kill someone. Ruby rolled on the floor with her, trying to put out her eyes with her fingers.<br/><br/>Jimmy began to drone the Nahuatl folk tune that Elena had taught him.<br/><br/><i>[JP: Alouette, gentile Alouette...</i><br/><i>Me</i>: That is not the song! <br/><br/><i>The song allows people to refresh any skill that is not Sanity or Health, but for once Stability was not excluded.]</i><br/><br/>"I'm going to kill you!" shouted Ruby.<br/><br/>"Once you are gone," said Millicent calmly, "I will return to Vanessa."<br/><br/><i>[And so MP got a Drive refresh.]</i><br/><br/>As Jimmy kept singing, the two women slowly came to their senses and stood up sheepishly. The deep voice nearby kept droning on, filling their heads, driving out coherent thought.<br/><br/>"Sing!" said Geronimo. "We have to drive its evil away!"<br/><br/>"I am the very model of a modern major general..." began Ruby.<br/><br/>"<i>Salve regina, mater misercordiae, vita dulcedo...</i>" intoned Geronimo.<br/><br/>Millicent, who was a linguist, harmonized with Jimmy in Nahuatl. <br/><br/>Ruby, harking back to her sorority days, began to sing rhyming instructions to them. Millicent caught on and they were able to talk to each other after a fashion.<br/><br/><i>[They both had Art.]</i><br/><br/>They moved to the end of the room, where it split into two separate hallways. Jimmy could see that the stonework was probably from the Aztec period. They moved down the hallway and came up on a vast well in the ground. Jimmy stuck his head over the edge.<br/><br/>An enormous, lipless, snaggle-toothed mouth completely filled the bottom of it, twenty feet away.

The tongue unwound itself from Jimmy's neck and snapped around Ruby's neck.<br/><br/>Millicent tried to stab it, but her knife had little effect. Jimmy fired a burst down the well but the tongue kept up its grip. Geronimo fired shots into the tongue, then threw himself on Ruby, pulling the tongue off her neck. Jimmy shoved her back out of the room, and Geronimo pulled out his bundles of dynamite.<br/><br/>"Mr. Wright, what should I do?" said Millicent!<br/><br/>"Go!" he shouted. Ruby stumbled into the corridor. The tongue lashed itself around his wrist and yanked him back to the edge. Ruby scrambled forward and pulled him back from the edge, prying the tongue off of his wrist and pushing him into the corridor.<br/><br/>Geronimo looked at his tools. He only had short-burning fuses left. "Get out of here!" he called over his back.<br/><br/><i>[GP was out of Demolitions at this point, so Geronimo was planning to detonate the bomb at close range. And then...MP offered a Cthulhu Mythos spend.

He lit the fuse and prepared to throw it down the well. He felt strangely at peace, knowing that he'd see his brother again soon.<br/><br/>As she ran, Millicent turned to look down the hall. "Mr. Cuevas isn't coming!" she said.<br/><br/>"He's making sure the bomb goes off," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"That's not fair," said Millicent. "That's <i>not fair.</i>"<br/><br/>She stopped dead and pulled her hand out of Jimmy's. She swiveled around and raised her arm, just as Geronimo tossed the bomb...\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Afterward, they were never quite sure what happened, as they all lost consciousness in the confusion. But to Geronimo it seemed that as he let go of the dynamite, the corridor...warped...growing longer and longer, faster and faster, until he was thirty...forty...a hundred feet away from the well, all <i>without his moving at all</i>. There was a whistling, eerie noise in the air, and it seemed for a second that he heard strange voices singing.

Twenty or thirty feet above them was an iron grate, the only source of light they had. The floor of the well was a disgusting muddy ooze. <br/><br/>Ruby came shakily to her feet. All around her was the scent of Nectar. She looked up and saw a woman standing next to the edge of the well. A thick veil concealed her face.<br/><br/>As she stared, she saw horrid Mouths open all along the sides of the well, dripping Nectar.<br/><br/><i>Steady, steady, old girl</i>, she thought. <i>Flopping around in the mud isn't going to make all this horror go away. And...whatever just happened up there...I need time to think about this</i>.<i> </i>Jimmy and Geronimo struggled to their feet next to her. Geronimo put a comforting hand on her shoulder.<br/><br/><i>[RP actually made the Stability test to </i>not<i> go for the Nectar!]</i><br/><br/>The woman began to talk in a sing-song voice, with a strange lisp. "You think you're clever," she said. "But you cannot kill our god."<br/><br/><i>That voice</i>, thought Ruby. <i>Leticia de la Luz.</i> She slowly began moving her hand around to her back and inside her blouse. She could still feel the little .25 Colt she had taped under her brassiere strap hanging between her shoulder blades. It was clear the rest of their guns had been taken.<br/><br/><i>[Big Preparedness spend by RP.]</i><br/><br/>"You will have much time to contemplate this," continued Leticia, "as you sit here and slowly die of disease. But I do owe you a farewell...so I will sing you a lullaby."<br/><br/>With a snarl, Ruby pulled the pistol free, spun it in her hand, and fired it directly up at Leticia. The shot buried itself in her chest. Black ichor began to pour out of the wound, and the veil slipped from Leticia's face. She bent down, glaring at Ruby, and then her face split down the middle, revealing ragged edges filled with teeth. A hissing growl filled the air.<br/><br/>Ruby sighed and began to collapse into the ooze. As she slipped down, Jimmy snatched the gun from her hand and emptied the clip directly into Leticia. He stood there for several moments, finger spasmodically squeezing the trigger even as the hammer clicked on an empty chamber, black ooze dripping down onto his face from Leticia's lifeless body.<br/><br/>Geronimo gently took the gun from him and lowered Jimmy's arm. "Millicent has fainted. I believe you can make your way to the top by stabbing the mouths with a knife and using them as a handhold. I experimented on some of the nearby ones, and they do not bite after being stabbed."<br/><br/>Jimmy shook his head and grunted, and then began the long climb up the slimy walls. He glanced down to see Geronimo propping up Ruby. It was clear that some Nectar must have gotten into her mouth when she fainted the second time.<br/><br/>When he reached the top, he swung out onto the grille, holding himself suspended by one hand while rifling through Leticia's pockets with the other. Eventually he found a key that unlocked the grille, and pulled himself up into another underground storage room. There was some rope nearby and he used it to pull the women and Geronimo out of the pit.<br/><br/>Nearby, they could hear the sound of a gramophone playing some sad French Socialist songs.<br/><br/>Geronimo found a couple of the kind of pistols Brooks' men had been carrying on a table in one corner. He handed one to Jimmy, and they walked toward the sound of the music, which was coming from behind a nearby door.<br/><br/>The door wasn't locked, but Jimmy kicked it in anyway. On the wall opposite to them was an enormous poster of Billie Holliday, with the mouth defaced and scratched away. A pink carpet gave the dank chamber an incongruously cheerful note. Brooks was sitting by the record player, with his back to the door. A picture album with photographs of Leticia and him, while she was still human, was open on his lap.<br/><br/>He straightened when they came in the room, but didn't turn around. "Is she dead?" he asked.<br/><br/>Jimmy and Geronimo looked at each other, and raised their guns.<br/><br/>Brooks looked down at his hands. "Useless," he said. "Useless--"<br/><br/>There were two loud bangs, and then the sound of a phonograph needle clicking at the edge of a record. \n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>When they came back, Jimmy and Geronimo found Millicent trying to hold Ruby down. They could see that she was in the grips of a Nectar sexual frenzy. Geronimo yanked Ruby away from the girl.<br/><br/>She wrapped her arms and legs around the Spaniard. "Oh, Geronimo," she sighed. "Let's not restrain ourselves." She began pulling off the buttons on his shirt.<br/><br/>Trembling, Geronimo gently pushed her away. "Now is not the time," he said huskily. "I...cannot. Not like this!" <i>Not when she is not herself.</i> "Jimmy! Help me!"<br/><br/>Jimmy shoved Ruby away from Geronimo and twisted her around. He handcuffed her behind her back and then pushed her into a corner.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Millicent searched the blood-soaked room that Brooks had been shot in. She found a small datebook with an itinerary neatly written down inside, the history of an expedition to the city of Merida in the Yucatan. She also found a letter from Brooks to SS, with one interesting phrase: "The more I think about it, the more I am convinced that it really <i>does</i> all come down to Merida--that everything comes back to her..."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>They went their separate ways to prepare for the trip to the Yucatan. Ruby met Captain Murphy in Puerto Vallerta and decided to take a relaxing Pacific cruise through the Canal and then looping back up to Merida. Murphy was surprised by how fragile she was.<br/><br/>Betty flew Jimmy, Janet, and Geronimo back to Los Angeles. Geronimo spent much of his time going to church, and confessing how much he had been tempted by fornication.<br/><br/>Jimmy took Janet out on the town, meeting with the local bigwigs and trying to repair his fraying network of connections, including Senator Grey, who he ran into one night at the Players'.<br/><br/>"How did that whole poisoning the reservoir thing turn out?" said Grey.<br/><br/>"It had an explosive result."<br/><br/>"I'm going to forget I heard that, since I'm a member of Congress.

As she flipped through the morning newspaper, she came upon a small item:<br/><br/><i>Graveyard vandalized--Caretaker Injured</i><br/><br/>"Wait...I didn't...did I? No, I only vanished that one time..." she said to herself.<br/><br/>"You need some more coffee, hun?" asked the waitress.<br/><br/>"Yes, sure," she said, distracted. Betty and Jimmy walked into the coffee shop.<br/><br/>"Flying this trip should be easy," Betty was saying. "Jump to Arizona, then eventually to New Orleans, and down to Havana to meet the Captain. You ever been in Havana, boss?"<br/><br/>Jimmy grunted and took a slug of whiskey.<br/><br/>But the trip turned out to actually be easy for once, and a few days later they were drinking Cuba Libres with Captain Murphy and Ruby in Havana.<br/><br/>"It's just rum and Coke," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"It's the surroundings, James," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"I've done some research," said Millicent brightly, hauling several books up on to the table.<br/><br/>She had been thorough. They were headed to M\xe9rida, named--like all the other M\xe9ridas in the Hispanophone world--after M\xe9rida in Extremadura, Spain. An unholy proportion of the conquistadors had been from that region, and many of those had been from M\xe9rida. Fifteen or twenty years ago, the M\xe9rida in the Yucat\xe1n had been one of the richest cities in the world, full of men who had made their fortune in the hemp ropes made from the sistal plant. The region had been ravaged in the nineteenth century by the Caste War, an uprising of the Mayan tribes in the region that had never quite died down.<br/><br/><i>[Library Use by MP; this came without a spend...]</i><br/><br/>An interesting bit of trivia came up: there had been a famous shipwreck in 1911 of a SS <i>M\xe9rida</i>, which was rumored to have been carrying a large amount of the treasury of the Mexican government, fleeing the coming Revolution. No one had yet managed to salvage the treasure, if it existed.<br/><br/>The Mayan civilization of the region had vanished centuries ago; their ruined cities, built around the sinkhole wells called cenotes, still littered the jungle.<br/><br/><i>[As an aside, the cenotes were caused by the dinosaur-killer asteroid! This came from the Library Use spend that MP made.]</i><br/><br/>One curious tribe of the region had drawn her attention: the Xoxul. Their name was a Mayan word for <i>outcast</i> or <i>evil people</i>. In 1850, an explorer named Arthur Cartwright had found ruins he called Chichen Xoxul, centered around a pyramid dedicated to "sorcery and the stars." The site was pretty remote and probably a ritual area, not an actual city, and made by the Mayans; the Xoxul had captured it from them.<br/><br/>While Cartwright had translated the word Xoxul as <i>wicked people</i>, Millicent's research revealed that while that wasn't the original meaning of the word in Mayan, it had taken on that meaning in the region--because the local Mayans considered the Xoxul to be an evil group of magicians. The Xoxul, according to them, worshiped gods associated with the nine Lords of the Night, especially one god, whom they had made massive amounts of human sacrifice to--Golxumel.<br/><br/>"That sounds like Gol-Goroth," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Might be the same guy," said Millicent. "The Mayans said he was toad or birdlike, and one name the Xoxul had for him translates as <i>Fisher</i>."<br/><br/>"The Fisher From Outside," mused Jimmy. "That's a name for Gol-Goroth as well."<br/><br/>"There was a conquistador name Francisco de Belacazar," continued Millicent. "He wanted to visit Chichen Xoxul. But his guide told him that he would not take him there, for 'I am no Xoxul, nor will I go to their place.' Francisco went anyway...and was never seen again."<br/><br/>"Just where is this Chichen Xoxul?"<br/><br/>"On the estate of a guy named Francisco de la Vega. He has a big sistal plantation."<br/><i>[This all ended up being a Library Use 2-point spend, for volume and speed of information.]</i><br/><br/>"I remember something about this," said Jimmy. He flipped around one of Millicent's books. "Yeah, look. This Golxumel guy came to the Yucat\xe1n at the end of the Mayan period. And they say he's going to return one day."<br/><br/>"Do you think this is the being behind the mouths?"<br/><br/>"Maybe...he might fit the description."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>They flew down to M\xe9rida the next day. Murphy had already made the crossing, and met them at their hotel. Charlie stood behind him, holding the bags and looking intently at Murphy, as usual.<br/><br/>"We're going to need an in with this guy de la Vega," said Jimmy to Ruby.<br/><br/>"One of my father's friends is down here, an American wildcatter. He can probably a find us place to meet the locals. We're meeting him for drinks tonight here in the hotel salon."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>"M\xe9rida ain't exactly what you call a hopping town," said Hank Peterson. "If you're looking for social life, do what I do and fly back to Havana."<br/><br/>"We've done Havana," said Ruby, sipping her drink and leaning back against the mahogany bar.<br/><br/>Hank was typical for a lot of her father's friends--one of the first generation of the great American oil prospectors. He had a salt and pepper beard, hair that hung lankly over his forehead, and wore a bolo tie. He had a thick East Texas accent.<br/><br/>"Well, there's a club in town. Might be hard to get you in, your name ain't Spanish. Though you are rich, and that goes a long way."<br/><br/>"Oh, but I have a Spanish name <i>now</i>," said Ruby. "There's my husband coming now. Hello, Geronimo!"<br/><br/>"Se\xf1or Peterson," said Geronimo, shaking Hank's hand. "An honor. Ruby has said much about you."<br/><br/>"Well, I'll be," said Hank, eyeing Geronimo a little suspiciously. "Congratulations to you both. You down here prospecting for your pa?"<br/><br/><i>[Hank is suspicious because Geronimo has Credit Rating 2.]</i><br/><br/>"No, I'm on an archaeological tour."<br/><br/>"That is a big deal down here. There's Chichen Itza, where the Maya used to have their shindigs, and Uxmal...I don't even know what that is really. Thought it was a kind of tobacco, but I guess it was a city of some kind."<br/><br/>"I was hoping to see those, and another place...Chichen..."<br/><br/>"Xoxul," said Millicent. "I'm her secretary, Mr. Peterson."<br/><br/>"And you are...what the hell are you?" said Hank to Jimmy.<br/><br/>"A friend. Jimmy Wright."<br/><br/>"Well...I suppose you can head down to the Conquistador Club. Happy to have you as guests. Mr. and Mrs..."<br/><br/>"Cuevas."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>"I need a wedding ring," said Ruby to Captain Murphy.<br/><br/>"Now, Ruby, we've talked about this. You're a great gal and all, but you know my mistress is the sea."<br/><br/>"No, it's for my fake marriage to Geronimo."<br/><br/>"What?"<br/><br/>"It's part of my master plan."<br/><br/>"I know what I have to do then," said Murphy. He went to his cabin and returned with a flat wooden box.<br/><br/>"Oh, you keep your jewelry there?"<br/><br/>Murphy opened the box to reveal a pair of matched pistols. "All right, Jerry, you and I are going to have a duel over this!"<br/><br/>"Murphy, this is the second fake husband of mine you've try to shoot!"<br/><br/>"I didn't try to shoot him, I shot him! In the leg counts, according to the Code Duello!"<br/><br/>"It counts, but you were drunk and trying to shoot him in the head."<br/><br/>"I only let him off because he was crying."<br/><br/>"Of course. This is all for the mission, so just calm down."<br/><br/>"I don't even know why you'd want to even fake marriage to some guy named Joseph McCarthy!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448429/#Comment_448429" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-09T14:53:26+00:00" title="September  9, 2015  2:53PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VII: As the Gloom Begins To Fall (Part 2)</b><br/><br/>The Conquistador Club was formal in the way that only old-school Spanish colonials can pull off. The men wore cutaway jackets or military uniforms. Their women wore severe black full-skirted dresses heavy with lace. In one corner was an old Frenchman, a subaltern under Maximilian who had stayed mostly out of spite.<br/><br/>The club itself had a magnificent Belle Epoque cast iron facade. The main salon had a domed glass roof. An orchestra played Viennese waltzes, although few people were dancing.<br/><br/>Hank took Ruby on a tour of the room, talking to the landowners with mineral rights. Ruby chatted pleasantly with them while scanning the room.<br/><br/>"Oh, who's <i>that</i>?" she asked, pointing at an elegant middle-aged man.<br/><br/>"Him? That's Francisco de la Vega, local bigshot," said Hank.<br/><br/>"Let us go make his acquaintance," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>De la Vega had heavy features, thick eyebrows, and a face that naturally settled into a frown. He graciously kissed Ruby's hand and made a quick bow to Geronimo. "I can tell by your accent you are Aragonese, yes?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"I had occasion to visit Zaragoza once. Charming city. I hope you know Barcelona? I had many happy days there, before the current difficulties. Soon, though, I think order will be restored throughout Spain and the good work of Generalissimo Franco will allow the king to return. I give money to his noble cause, and the Church to support the refugees. One day the Communist and socialist scum will be driven from our mother country."<br/><br/>Containing his rage with aplomb, Geronimo nodded agreement. "It is to be hoped for."<br/><br/>"You may have heard that we have similar difficulties here in Yucat\xe1n. The Mayans are succumbing to the poisonous allure of these false ideologies."<br/><br/>Ruby turned the conversation to archaeology. "We've been to Chichen Itza and the other sites. I'm looking for something different, something few people have seen. I've heard that you have some ruins on your property."<br/><br/><i>[Archaeology spend by RP; this was to impress de la Vega that she actually had been to some of the other sites, and allay his suspicions.]</i><br/><br/>"I am impressed," said de la Vega. "I've known few women who have climbed the Stairs of Quetzalcoatl."<br/><br/>"I am not many women."<br/><br/>"No, indeed you are not," said de la Vega. Glancing at Geronimo, he made another quick bow. "<i>Con su permisso, se\xf1or.</i>"<br/><br/>"We would like to visit Chichen Xoxul, if you'll allow us on your land."<br/><br/>"I think you would not be impressed. It is nothing more than an old well and some stones. <i>Chicen</i> means well in Mayan, as perhaps you know."<br/><br/>"Your pronunciation is excellent."<br/><br/>"Thank you. I have both Mayan and Spanish ancestry. I do not hold with these stuck up old fools who are obsessed with pure Spanish blood. There is good blood in this country too."<br/><br/>"How admirable. But I would still like to visit the ruins."<br/><br/>"I'm sure they will disappoint. However, please come out to my estate as my guests. My man will work it out with your man. Just let me know where you are staying."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Back at the hotel, Betty and Millicent were studying. At least until nine o' clock, when Betty threw down her book. "There's an excellent bar in this hotel," she said. "Why are we sitting up here in this room like a couple of old maids?"<br/><br/>"Did you get at least half the questions right?"<br/><br/>"I got some."<br/><br/>"Good enough."<br/><br/>They got dressed and dropped down to the ballroom. There was a lively crowd dancing to the Latin band, and many beautiful women in evening dresses floated through the crowd like exquisite tropical birds.<br/><br/>Millicent perched on a stool by the bar, talking with the bartender. "I met a man in Mexico City who said he had sent some men out this way to look at some local ruins. I don't know their names, but he was called Jonathon Brooks. Have you seen anyone like that?"<br/><br/>"You should talk to the local guides," said the bartender. "They don't come to a place like this."<br/><br/>Millicent ordered another drink. A woman of about thirty, in a long midnight blue evening gown turned to her. "Pardon me, I couldn't help overhearing you talking before. Are you an American?" She had a nice upper-class British accent.<br/><br/>"Guilty as charged."<br/><br/>"Oh, thank God. I thought I wasn't going to be able to speak English again tonight."<br/><br/>"Even with an American?" said Millicent, grinning. "What brings you here?"<br/><br/>"I'm in transit, actually. Havana, then maybe Vera Cruz. Perhaps New Orleans after that, and New York. We haven't decided."<br/><br/>"Havana is lovely."<br/><br/>"Happy to know it, thanks. Actually, this is a bit of a <i>wanderjahr</i> for me. My husband is back in England taking care of our children, and a friend of mine asked me to come out and look after some of her affairs in the Americas. In the meantime I'm able to enjoy myself. My goodness, I love my children, but I haven't had a proper vacation in a decade. Evelyn O'Connell, by the way."<br/><br/>"Millicent Lowell. This is my friend Betty Auckland."<br/><br/>"How ya doin'?" said Betty, pumping Evelyn's hand. "This guy, I think he asked me to dance or for a fiver. One way or the other I'm gonna find out more." She bounced off to the dance floor accompanied by a tall, dark, and handsome Mexican man.<br/><br/>"She certainly has <i>joie de vivre</i>," said Evelyn, with a wry grin. "Reminds me a bit of my husband, actually. He's American too."<br/><br/>"Have you been to Los Angeles?"<br/><br/>"Haven't the pleasure."<br/><br/>"Just keep in mind that the water is rather cold at the beaches...about...you prefer Celsius or Fahrenheit?"<br/><br/>"I'm used to both. I've been to the Continent, to Africa...rather a bally lot of places, actually. You see, I studied archaeology in Egypt about ten years ago."<br/><br/>"Really?

"My God, I thought that Jean would never shut up--"<br/><br/>She stopped short. The room was in complete disarray. The beds had been stripped, the dresser drawers had been pulled out and tossed, the backs of pictures had been pulled out to see if anything was hidden behind them.<br/><br/>"James," she said. "It happened again."<br/><br/>"Professional job," said Jimmy. "Good tradecraft. Probably couldn't have done it better."<br/><br/>"Why'd they leave it such a mess, then?"<br/><br/>"To send a message."<br/><br/>"I have to go," said Ruby, dashing past Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Where are the girls?" he said to Jimmy.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Ruby pounded on the hatch of the <i>Murphy's Law</i>, which was tied up at a landing not far from her hotel. The door opened, revealing a rather disheveled Captain Murphy. "Why, Mrs. Cuevas," he said. "Whatever brings you down here?"<br/><br/>"One question: did you mess with anyone's room?"<br/><br/>"Why would I do that? The only reason would be to send a message to someone."<br/><br/>"Did you send a message to anyone?"<br/><br/>"If I was going to do that, I'd use Western Union!" Murphy took a step forward, and stumbled. A strong arm grabbed him from behind and pulled him upright. Ruby looked into the tatooed face of Charlie.<br/><br/>"You've never lied to me," she said. "Is he telling the truth?"<br/><br/>Charlie nodded gravely.<br/><br/>"Wait a minute," said Murphy. "Someone was in your room? Was it Geronimo?"<br/><br/>"No, no. We're just doing the sting operation together."<br/><br/>"So you're in trouble, eh Rubycakes? You should stay here with me tonight."<br/><br/>"Wait here. I'll be back if there's any trouble. Keep drinking."<br/><br/>"I was going to do that anyway!"\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>"I'm planning to go on an expedition to Ethiopia with professor Fauche later this year," Millicent said to Evelyn.<br/><br/>"Professor <i>Luc</i> Fauche? I met him. Quite charming. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to make a phone call." Evelyn got up and glided out of the bar. She passed Jimmy and Geronimo, who burst into the bar and made a beeline for Millicent.<br/><br/>"Good, you're all right," panted Jimmy. "The room was searched. Again."<br/><br/>"Why? We just got here! Until...oh...we're being watched, aren't we? Who the heck is following us?"<br/><br/>"Who the hell isn't following us at this point?"<br/><br/>"I think it was Bethany. And we didn't do much to hide our presence--we took Ruby's plane, and Murphy's ship will be in the arrivals column," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"And that grave I told you about, somebody vandalized the cemetery and attacked the groundskeeper," blurted Millicent.<br/><br/>Jimmy sputtered. "We'll talk about it later," he said. "Betty! Get over here!"<br/><br/>Betty came up with a tall, dark, Latin stranger. "Mr. J! This is Alfonso. He's...uh...tall."<br/><br/>"Forgive me se\xf1or," said Alfonso, shaking Jimmy's hand gravely. "I did not realize you were her father."<br/><br/><i>[In retrospect, this was the moment the session transformed from a serious Cthulhu investigation into a Neil Simon sex farce. I consider this one of the nicest presents any gaming group has ever given me as a GM.]</i><br/><br/>"Damn right," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"<i>Au revoir, se\xf1orita</i>," Alfonso said, elegantly bowing to kiss Betty's hand.<br/><br/>"We don't have time for that!" said Jimmy, pushing him away. "Betty! Our room got tossed!"<br/><br/>Betty blanched. "I'm sorry, Mr. J. You can have my resignation right away. I mean, that's terrible tradecraft! It's not like Millicent can help me, she's just some schoolgirl!"<br/><br/>"They didn't search our room until we left!" said Milicent.<br/><br/>"Wait...we're being watched!"<br/><br/>"See, you figured that out all by yourself! We need you! Mr. Wright needs you!"<br/><br/><i>[GP, to JP: You need to be supportive.</i><br/><i>RP: Yeah, be a good father.]</i><br/><br/>Ruby ran up to the bar. "Murphy didn't do it."<br/><br/>"Who thought he did?" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"I did. He's kind of a jealous guy."<br/><br/>"Betty, don't worry about it," said Jimmy. "It happens. But a private eye needs to plan ahead. Remember that."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448472/#Comment_448472" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-11T16:19:03+00:00" title="September 11, 2015  4:19PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VII: As the Gloom Begins To Fall (Part 4)</b><br/><br/>"We must keep up appearances," said Geronimo, walking Ruby back to the suite. "If we are being watched, we must keep up the pretense that we are husband and wife."<br/><br/>"Good point," said Ruby, walking into the debris of the room. She opened the door to her room of the suite. "We'll sleep together tonight."<br/><br/>Geronimo stopped dead at the threshold of the room. The large crucifix fixed to one wall seemed to glare at him. Ruby obliviously went into the bathroom to prepare her evening toilet.<br/><br/>"I can't," said Geronimo, waving his hands in front of his face. He gently lifted the crucifix from the wall and carried it out to the balcony. On the balcony next to his, an old man was standing smoking. He watched Geronimo with a puzzled expression on his face. <i>Jewish</i>? he mouthed at him.<br/><br/>Geronimo shrugged and went back into the room.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Jimmy stopped at the front desk to collect Janet. He rang the bell and asked the night clerk to bring him the contents of the safe he'd given them when he checked in.<br/><br/>"What do you keep in there?" asked Janet.<br/><br/>"Some books."<br/><br/>The clerk returned with a few bundles of letters, and a heavy algebra textbook.<br/><br/>"Mr. Wright, that's my book! I've been looking for it!" said Millicent.<br/><br/>Unperturbed, Jimmy opened the book. A section of the pages had been cut out in a neat square, creating a hollow containing a moldering old book with a cracked binding.<br/><br/>"Isn't that one of the books we took from Trammel's?" asked Millicent.<br/><br/>Jimmy nodded. "I like to hide those kinds of books. It's too dangerous to leave them where they can be found."<br/><br/>"Jimmy, isn't that awfully paranoid?" asked Janet.<br/><br/>"I can't remember the last time my room wasn't searched," said Jimmy, taking her arm and leading her towards the stairs. "I think my paranoia has justification."<br/><br/>An old man came up to the counter as they were leaving and angrily stubbed out a cigarette. "I was assured," he said to the startled night clerk, "That you did not allow <i>those people</i> into this establishment..."<br/><br/>While the clerk and the old man argued, Janet leaned in to Jimmy. "With everything that's happened tonight, I just...don't feel comfortable sleeping alone."<br/><br/>"Fine," said Jimmy. "I'll take the couch."<br/><br/>"Oh," said Janet. She paused a moment. "I suppose I should tell you, that in this tropical weather, I simply have to sleep in the nude."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Millicent and Betty returned to the room they shared and tried to clean up the mess. <i>Why do they always have to be so thorough</i>, Millicent thought to herself, and sighed. As she made her bed, she noticed that her copy of <i>Tropic of Cancer</i> was exactly where she had left it on the nightstand.<br/><br/><i>That's odd</i>, she thought. <i>Why didn't they move it?</i> She flipped through the pages of the book. Many passages had been underlined by her, with some notes scribbled in the margins. She was about to put the book back when she noticed something odd. There were some underlined passages that hadn't been there before; in fact, they were past her bookmark, in sections of the book she hadn't read yet.<br/><br/>"So Millicent," Betty said, breaking her out of her reverie, "When you're done picking up your side of the room, could you clear out for a while? Alfonso is gonna come up to see me."<br/><br/>"If it's just for that, then okay. But if he's going to kidnap you--"<br/><br/>"Nobody's kidnapping me," said Betty, chambering a round in the large .45 automatic she kept under her pillow.<br/><br/>"Good enough," squeaked Millicent. "I think I'll go tell Mr. Wright that Evelyn O'Donnell knows Professor Dreamy Eyes...just in case..."<br/><br/>She ran through the living room and tapped on the door to Jimmy's room. Inside, Jimmy was nervously reading a copy of <i>Popular Sistal Growing</i>, which was in Spanish, and anyway he was holding upside down.<br/><br/>"Jimmy," said Janet from the bed, "could you maybe give me a backrub? I'm really tense."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448507/#Comment_448507" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-13T04:51:52+00:00" title="September 13, 2015  4:51AM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I understand why Geronimo resisted temptation.

He looked down and saw a man climb up the balcony next to his. The man glanced at him, held a finger to his lips, and whispered "Shh! Se\xf1or."<br/><br/>From the room behind the balcony, Geronimo heard Betty's hoarse whisper. "Alfonso! C'mere!"<br/><br/>Geronimo looked over at the crucifix leaning up against the side of the balcony. "I'll give him twenty minutes," he said, and lit another cigarette.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Down at the <i>Murphy's Law</i>, Captain Murphy was sweeping the side of the hotel with his telescope. He saw the light from Geronimo's cigarette and focused in on the Spaniard. "He's smoking! You know what that means, Charlie! It means--"<br/><br/>But Charlie would have to wait. Murphy's wild gesticulations and inebriated state combined to make him trip, stumble, hang for a long moment precisely balanced on the edge of the deck, and then tumble over backwards into the water.<br/><br/>He came up sputtering. "Charlie! Stop pointing and grinning! Help me up outta here! Enough with your games!"<br/><br/>Charlie held out one hand. "You are lucky the code of honor among my people does not allow me to attack you in such an inebriated state," he said in a South Pacific language of great antiquity. "One day you will be awake enough."<br/><br/>With one great muscled arm he hauled Murphy onto the deck and then went back to sharpening his kukri.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Ruby awoke, oddly enough, with the dawn. She took off the sleep mask and saw Geronimo snoring quietly in a chair next to the French doors that led to the balcony. Somehow he managed to keep his back straight even while asleep, she noted. A cigarette had burned itself out while still clutched in two fingers. She gently removed the butt and then covered him lovingly with a blanket. She gave him a peck on the cheek.<br/><br/>She stepped out onto the balcony. Glancing over at Betty's room, she saw a man climbing down out of her balcony. The man paused, then held a finger to his lips. "Shh! Se\xf1ora!" he said, and finished sliding down to the ground.<br/><br/>Ruby shrugged, and turned back to go into the room. Noticing the crucifix that was propped up in one corner, she picked it up and brought it inside with her. She hung it up on the wall and went to make herself up for the day.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Neither Jimmy nor Janet had slept at all during the night. As the dawn light streaked across the sky, Janet yawned and sat up in bed, careful to keep the sheets pinned to her chest.. "Morning, James."<br/><br/>"Morning."<br/><br/>"I'm going to do my toilet, so maybe you should go to the other room."<br/><br/>"Sure." Jimmy slowly made his way into the living room, where Millicent was folding up a blanket.<br/><br/>"Morning Mr. Wright," she said chirpily. "See, I slept in the same clothes I was wearing, that's a plus, isn't it?"<br/><br/>"I need a cup of coffee right now," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Oh, I made some. Would you like a cup--"<br/><br/>Jimmy grabbed the pot from her with a barely-concealed snarl.<br/><br/>There was a muffled shout from Ruby's room. Jimmy ran to the door and yanked it open to find Geronimo staring at the crucifix, which was directly across from the chair he was sitting in. "I've done NOTHING!" said Geronimo to the wooden figure of Jesus. "I have done nothing but protect her!"<br/><br/>"Easy," said Jimmy, guiding Geronimo out to the balcony. They stood for a moment in the golden sunlight.<br/><br/>The doors to Betty's balcony shot open and Betty stepped outside. "What a morning!" she crowed, stretching magnificently. "Hey, how did you guys sleep last night?"<br/><br/>"James," said Geronimo, lighting a cigarette. "Cafe, por favor."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Janet met Ruby coming out of her room, immaculately turned out as always. "So, how was your night?" she asked.<br/><br/>"Oh, I slept beautifully," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Well. Congratulations to you, then."<br/><br/>"You didn't sleep well?"<br/><br/>In answer, Janet picked up the phone. "Room service? Could you send up a pitcher of bloody marys?" She looked at Ruby. "You want anything?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager"

"She distracted you while the room got tossed."<br/><br/>"Sorry Mr. Wright."<br/><br/>"It's all right. But you had a good idea about finding out what happened to Brooks' expedition. Let's find some of the local guides."<br/><br/>A day's worth of talking to people turned up three names: Pablo Garza, Guillermo Castillo, and a third man named Jacinto Espinoza. Nobody had seen Espinoza for a while, however.<br/><br/>"They're scared to talk about him," said Jimmy. "Let's find out why."<br/><br/>After a while, he pieced together enough by reading between the lines to get a fix on the story: Espinoza had been hired by a party to head out into the woods near the de la Vega estate; they went into them about a month ago, and nobody had seen any of them since.<br/><br/>"Maybe it was bandits," said one of his informants. "A lot of Maya are still upset they lost their empire. Six hundred and thirty-seven years, you'd think they'd give it up by now, but they're still upset at the Spanish."<br/><br/>"And you haven't seen any of the Mexicans who hired Jacinto?"<br/><br/>"No. If you want a guide, I guess you could hire Pablo, he's okay, or Guillermo."<br/><br/>Another man spoke up: "Or they could hire Nic."<br/><br/>"Yeah, like I'd tell them to hire Nic," said Jimmy's informant with a laugh. "You would not survive, se\xf1or."<br/><br/>"Who's Nic?"<br/><br/>"No, se\xf1or, I respect you too much...Nic is also a guide, grew up here. But...Nic has a temper. You are obviously a hidalgo of great standing, I would not inflict that on you."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>De la Vega sent a car driven by a liveried chauffeur of obviously Mayan ancestry. He drove Jimmy, Geronimo, Ruby, Millicent, and Janet out to the de la Vega estate.<br/><br/>"Tail us," said Jimmy to Betty.<br/><br/>As they reached the gate to the estate, they saw the de la Vega coat of arms displayed prominently over the gate. But nearby, etched into a wall, was an older coat of arms, mostly obscured by plaster and paint. But Ruby could just make out some of the details, especially the prominent letter E.<br/><br/>"Wasn't...Echevarr\xeda from the Yucat\xe1n?" she asked Jimmy, who just shook his head.<br/><br/>The de la Vega manor was at the end of a long, winding cypress lined drive. It was in turn of the century style, the cross between Belle Epoque and traditional Mexican hacienda style they had seen in M\xe9rida. They were conducted to a sitting room where they met de la Vega's other guests, some local plantation owners and their wives.<br/><br/>De la Vega made an appropriately grand entrance, striding into the room wearing riding boots and a white summer cutaway. A few medasl hung from the breast of his dinner jacket. "Se\xf1oras y se\xf1ores," he said. "I am so glad you are all here. It is so rare we get a chance to speak to so many charming norteamericanos, not to mention a brother of ours from Espa\xf1a."<br/><br/>"Thank you for having us," said Ruby in her most flattering tone.<br/><br/>"The honor is mine. Allow me to show you some of the few treasures I am fortunate enough to possess." De la Vega led them down a hallway, pausing in front of an old oil painting that Ruby recognized as being in the style of the sixteenth century. It showed a man with hot black eyes and a stern face full of angry hauteur.<br/><br/>"Is that Francisco de Belacazar?" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Yes, he was an ancestor of mine," replied de la Vega. He led them through a pair of ornate double doors into the dining room. It was a long chamber lit with candles and the dying glow of the sunset. The table was covered with an excellent linen tablecloth and expensive place settings. De la Vega sat down in a large chair at the head of the table. There was a fireplace behind him, and on one side of it was hung a painting. It must have been six feet long by was rather narrow, nearly filling the gap between the mantel and the wainscoting. It was a full body portrait of a woman in a long dress with a broad fringe of lace. The woman's face stared boldly out of the portrait, angular and somehow aristocratic.<br/><br/>It looked disturbingly like the pictures they had seen of Leticia de la Luz before her transformation. But the painting was at least twenty years old.<br/><br/>The other side of the fireplace was blank, although discolorations on the wall showed that it must once have held a painting the same size as the one of the woman.<br/><br/>Ruby made some small talk about the other <i>objets d'art</i> in the house before turning to the portrait of the woman. "She's quite striking," she said. "Who is she?"<br/><br/>"Ah, that belonged to the previous owner of this house," said de la Vega. "It is a sad story. Perhaps not best for dinner conversation."<br/><br/><i>[Me: This is me running up the flag saying, you need to make a spend to get this.]</i><br/><br/>"I understand," said Ruby. "Still, I find myself fascinated by everything I've seen in M\xe9rida--this house most of all. I'd love to hear any stories about it; it's such an elegant place, I know it must be really the most interesting place."<br/><br/><i>[aaand Flattery spend by RP.]</i><br/><br/>"It was not originally my family's house," said de la Vega, pleased despite himself. "They were a sad family, the Echevarr\xedas. They must all be dead now--certainly the male line has died out. They made their money long ago, even before the sistal--and after that, they made their fortune. They fell on hard times. The son was involved in the Revolution, but he never returned to the Yucat\xe1n. That painting is his sister, Leticia de Echevarr\xeda. Most people called her M\xe9rida, because she was a natural child of their father. He legitimized her, but you understand how people are; she was clearly Mayan. They were very close...and she was once my betrothed."<br/><br/>"What happened to her?" asked Geronimo.<br/><br/>"No one is really sure," said de la Vega. "But my investigations indicate she most likely died in a shipwreck in 1911."<br/><br/>"How awful," said Ruby. "I am sorry for your loss."<br/><br/>"She was an exceptional woman. Her kind comes very, very rarely. But I am distressing my guests. Please, enjoy your dinner."<br/><br/>The dinner proved to be mostly local fare, and obviously made as hot as possible. Millicent, who had grown up eating Singapore food, dug in with relish. Geronimo shrugged; he'd eaten gypsy food before. Jimmy and Ruby made the best of it they could.<br/><br/><i>[It was, in fact, a choice between losing 1 Stability or 2 Health.]</i><br/><br/>"Se\xf1ora Cuevas," said de la Vega over brandy, "have you decided what archaeological site you wish to visit? I could arrange a trip to Chichen Itza."<br/><br/>"Already been," parried Ruby. "This Chichen Zoshul..."<br/><br/>"Xoxul," said de la Vega.<br/><br/>"Yes. I really am interested."<br/><br/>"Well, how can I refuse a woman of your caliber? You have my permission to visit my grounds. But I must insist you hire a guide. It is impossible otherwise."<br/><br/>"I've heard the names of a few...a Guillermo?"<br/><br/>"Se\xf1or Castillo? Strangely enough, he is exactly who I would recommend. He is a man of breeding and aristocratic bearing, extremely knowledgeable, especially about the Mayan ruins. If any man could guide you to Chichen Xoxul, it is him."<br/><br/>"And Pablo Garza?" asked Millicent.<br/><br/>"A peasant. He is insignificant."<br/><br/>"There was also another man," said Ruby. "A Nicolas?"<br/><br/>"Oh, you mean Nic? Ah...Nic...well, se\xf1ora, if you insist on hiring Nic, you find that to be it's own reward."<br/><br/>"Is he an odd fellow?"<br/><br/>"One could say so, yes," said de la Vega smugly.<br/><br/>"Does he know the ruins?" asked Millicent.<br/><br/>"Nic's father was an archaeologist from the United States who married a Mayan woman, and Nic was raised in both worlds. If you insist on hiring Nic Luke, then you should go to the garage near the waterfront. I think you find Nic there, and decide for yourself how that will work for you."<br/><br/>"We'll find a guide tomorrow, but I'll probably hire Guillermo."<br/><br/>"I will have him call upon your hotel," said de la Vega.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448575/#Comment_448575" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-16T16:49:44+00:00" title="September 16, 2015  4:49PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VII: As the Gloom Begins To Fall (Part 7)</b><br/><br/>After dinner, de la Vega brought out a small band and took everyone to the manor's ballroom. "May I dance with your lovely wife? Con su permisso, se\xf1or," said de la Vega to Geronimo.<br/><br/>Geronimo glowered but let de la Vega lead Ruby away. "Come on, Mr. Cuevas, I'll dance with you," said Millicent, pushing Geronimo out into the dance floor.<br/><br/><i>[Geronimo's Credit Rating of 2 got hammered in this scene; he simply wasn't equipped to deal with rich folks being jerks, didn't know the dances, didn't have the right table manners, etc. Listening to the tape I may have hit this note a bit too much, but de la Vega is a smug aristo and pretty suspicious of them all, so he pressed all his advantages.]</i><br/><br/>"Dance me closer to the corner," said Janet in Jimmy's ear as he led her in a brisk Viennese waltz. "I want to hear what Ruby is saying!"<br/><br/>"Se\xf1ora Cuevas," said de la Vega while guiding her through an elegant turn, "I must recommend you not go into the woods. It is not safe. There are bandits. You must be very wary of these Maya, they are without pity and do not take prisoners...of the men. I think you understand me."<br/><br/>"I've been in hairier situations in the past," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"I expected no less of a woman of your mettle."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>The next day Guillermo Castillo called on them at their hotel. He wore an immaculate white suit with spotless linen. He had a dancer's natural grace and stance, and stood smoking a long, thin French cigarette. "My good friend Don de la Vega asked me to come and see you. You are looking to put together an expedition? Good. If you are looking for Chichen Xoxul, I cannot advise it, for it is in extremely difficult terrain and to be frank...I do not think a beautiful woman such as yourself would be willing to make such a journey."<br/><br/>"Well, luckily for me I'm not Frank. I'm Ruby."<br/><br/>"Se\xf1or de la Vega told me you were extremely witty. But he did not do credit to your beauty."<br/><br/>"Have you met my husband?" said Ruby, pushing Geronimo forward.<br/><br/>Castillo backed away slightly from the Spaniard's grim face and iron handshake. "I will need a hundred pesos a day," he said quickly. "You will not interfere in the hiring of the porters as I only work with my own men. I will advise you in the purchase of equipment. If I tell you to buy a piece of equipment, you will buy it, or I will not come. If you try to interfere, fire, or otherwise disrupt my men, we will leave immediately. You must understand that while you are my client and I will do everything to fulfill the objectives of the mission, I am the guide. And you must follow my instructions absolutely in the woods. It is the only way to ensure your survival. Do you have weapons?"<br/><br/>"We are very much prepared," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"You have an Aragonese accent, don't you?" said Castillo. "I have heard that only the anarchists and socialists have left Aragon, and the patriots were those who stayed."<br/><br/><i>[RP: What a sh*tbag!]</i><br/><br/>"It became very uncomfortable for me in that environment," said Geronimo with deadly calm.<br/><br/>"Well, the war will soon be over. I must take my leave. If you wish to hire me, inform the concierge. Good day."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>"I don't think he liked you very much," said Ruby to Geronimo as they trooped down to the waterfront.<br/><br/>"I don't think many people here like me," said Geronimo. "I am sure they think I am some kind of adventurer who has seduced you."<br/><br/>"Oh," said Ruby.<br/><br/>They came upon a large garage perched at the end of pier. The place bustled with activity. Men in greasy shirts were crouched over all different types of engines--automotive, maritime, even an airplane engine. Ruby grabbed the nearest man. "I'm looking for Nic," she said.<br/><br/>"For Nic? Sure, who's asking?"<br/><br/>"I am. Can you go get him?"<br/><br/>"Him? Sure, why don't you come with me."<br/><br/>The man led them into an out of the way section of the garage. "He Nic, these gringos want to see you!" the man said to someone who had their head buried under the hood of a car.<br/><br/>The person straightened up and turned around.<br/><br/>"Oh," said Ruby. "Nic is short for <i>Nicole</i>."<br/><br/>Nic was a shortish woman with long, straight brown hair she had tied up under a bandanna. She wore a man's sleeveless tee shirt that was stained with oil and grease. She had a hard but not ugly face. A cigarette dangled out of the corner of her mouth. She put a wrench in the pocket of her jeans, wiped off her hands on a rag, and said something in Yucat\xe1n dialect to her employee. They both smirked.<br/><br/>"What the hell do you want in my garage," said Nic.<br/><br/>"We've heard you're a guide--"<br/><br/>"I'm not a guide. I'm not just going to lead you around from place to place. My father was an archaeologist, I am an archaeologist by training."<br/><br/>"So am I. We want to go to--"<br/><br/>"You're not an archaeologist. I know exactly what you are. You're one of those rich American dilettantes who come down here to 'make' a big discovery! See how the <i>local</i> people live! But do you care? You're going to leave what, a nickel for some poor Mayan kid who's half blind from eating millet? Whose parents had their legs cut off by the Spanish? This is why I don't work as a guide anymore. I'm tired of dealing with you rich Yanqui bastards coming down here."<br/><br/>"Do you or do you not want our money?" demanded Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Depends. What do you want me to do?"<br/><br/>"Take us to Chichen Xoxul."<br/><br/>"This your wife?"<br/><br/>"She is."<br/><br/>"I am very sorry, se\xf1or. Because clearly one of you must be dying if you want to go to Chichen Xoxul, and have decided that the best way to do it is to commit suicide! It is very romantic that you want to do it together."<br/><br/>"Listen," said Ruby.  "I'm here because I want to see stuff the way Bartolom\xe9 de las Casas described it, before the Spanish burned everything down. I am here to feel ten centuries of civilization stare down at me as I humble myself before the greatest pyramids of anywhere outside Cairo. I've read the Mayan codices, and I want to visit the tombs of those great men. To pay my respects, with sorrow."<br/><br/><i>[Art History spend by RP to swing Nic around.]</i><br/><br/>"You remind me of my father a tiny bit," said Nic. "He was a Yanqui but not a bastard. He helped people down here. During the caste war, he fought with the Mayans. You. Spaniard. What are you, Popular Front, or one of those assholes who work for Franco?"<br/><br/>Geronimo stared back. "Don't mention that man to me, or remind me of the sorrow he has inflicted on Spain."<br/><br/>Nic nodded. "I'll take you into the woods. You don't pay me. You don't have to pay me anything. You pay for the porters; I'll find them for you. You pay for the equipment too. What I want isn't money. I want a hundred rifles."<br/><br/>"Only if you promise to save at least one bullet for this de la Vega," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"You've got a deal."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448605/#Comment_448605" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-17T15:58:45+00:00" title="September 17, 2015  3:58PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VII: As the Gloom Begins To Fall (Part 8)</b><br/><br/>The mist was just beginning to break over the jungle and blow back out over the water when Ruby heard the sound of a plane's engine. After a short time, a seaplane emerged out of the mist, engine spinning down as it glided into shore.<br/><br/>A door opened in the back of the plane and Dr. Orange stuck out his head. "Ruby! You look...rugged?"<br/><br/>Ruby was wearing khaki slacks, a military style blouse, a camp hat, and had a rifle slung over her back. "Good to see you, Doctor."<br/><br/>Dr. Orange hopped to shore. "Got your message, and Comrade Trotsky sends his regards." A couple of Mayan campesinos began to unload long flat crates out of the plane.<br/><br/>"Who's the dame?" asked Julius, nodding at Nic.<br/><br/>Ruby grabbed his arm. "We need Nic, okay? So be respectful. Now come on, I'll take you down to the village."<br/><br/>"You left the hotel?"<br/><br/>"The housekeeping wasn't up to our standards."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Jimmy arrived at the Conquistador Club. "I'm a guest of Don de la Vega," he told the concierge, who silently led him to a private room in the back.<br/><br/>The room was a study in contrasts: a tasteful sitting room in the English style...with some of the more graphic and gruesome examples of Mayan art lining the walls. De la Vega was sitting in an armchair in his immaculate ice cream suit.<br/><br/>"Mr. Wright," he said. "I'm glad you could make it down here to talk to me."<br/><br/>"It was a bit of a surprise, actually."<br/><br/>"Are you still planning to make your expedition to Chichen Xoxul."<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"I am here to warn and beg you not to do this."<br/><br/>"<i>Warn</i> me? Why?"<br/><br/>"You must understand that the cult of the Xoxul has never completely died away. But it is different than it was in the old days, just as the Maya today are much different than they were before the Spanish arrived. The Xoxul were a people that wanted to find knowledge. That they used techniques that to them seemed natural and normal but to us seem repellent is perhaps an indictment of the human race, not the drive for knowledge. But more than that, se\xf1or, things have changed even in my own lifetime. Chichen Xoxul is a cursed place now. I do not recommend you go there. And it is not the fault of the Xoxul that it has become like this. <i>Something else</i> has made it this way."<br/><br/>"Trust me when I say if I had the choice not to go there, I would not go there."<br/><br/>"Ramon was such a man as you were. He wanted to go beyond the old ways. He knew of them, of course; his family, especially on his mother's side, they all knew the old ways. But he went too far, I think; he did something terrible out there, and it had consequences that nearly destroyed him."<br/><br/><i>[JP used Assess Honesty to determine that de la Vega really was genuinely concerned.]</i><br/><br/>"Why should I trust you about this?"<br/><br/>"You must understand that I had nothing to do with what happened to the previous expedition," said de la Vega. "I am not necessarily sorry they did not reach Chichen Xoxul...unless they did. And in that case, Chichen Xoxul took care of them."<br/><br/>"Somebody has to right things. Somebody has to fix that mistake. And it looks like it has to be me this time."<br/><br/>"You are a brave man, Mr. Wright."<br/><br/>"I try not to think about it."<br/><br/>"I have so far managed to keep the Federales from intervening. Oh, they are very interested in you!"<br/><br/>"I appreciate it."<br/><br/>"Are you sure that what you will do will not cause consequences to everyone else?"<br/><br/>"No."<br/><br/>"Then why should I not bring in the Federales, to stop you from doing this mad thing?"<br/><br/>"If nobody does anything, the world is screwed anyway."<br/><br/>"So you do this to protect others? Not for your own power?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"In that case, go with God, Mr. Wright. Whichever one you call your own."<br/><br/>"I think I've had enough of gods in my lifetime."<br/><br/>"You may see many strange things at Chichen Xoxul. It is a very dangerous place."<br/><br/>"Do you recommend a blindfold?"<br/><br/>"No. There is no way to go through it except with your eyes open."<br/><br/>"I was afraid you would say that."<br/><br/>"But if I can offer you assistance, I will."<br/><br/>"Do you have a map of Chichen Xoxul?

She found out, by buying coffee and flowers from various abuelas around town that M\xe9rida came to the Echevarr\xeda household when she was ten or eleven, and almost immediately she and Ramon became extremely close. Maybe...too close. She uncovered a rumor that in fact the two of them were in a morganitic marriage when they were both 16.<br/><br/>Both Ramon and M\xe9rida had been on the the steamer <i>SS M\xe9rida</i> that had sunk off the coast of Norfolk, Virginia. Fast-talking her way into the port warden's office, Millicent found out that while M\xe9rida Echevarr\xeda had left from Vera Cruz, Ramon met them when the ship arrived in Cuba. M\xe9rida was not listed among the survivors of the wreck.<br/><br/>M\xe9rida had two children: Salvador, who died when he was a boy, and a girl most people called Rosacruz. Nobody has seen her since after M\xe9rida vanished; it was rumored she went to Mexico City to live with relatives.<br/><br/>When Millicent finally returned to her hotel room, on her bed she found a copy of <i>Lady Chatterly's Lover</i> with a note in a feminine hand written inside the cover: "Thought you might enjoy this one too."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>By May Day they were all staying in a coastal Mayan village, the guests of Nic Luke and her friends. This was Zapatista territory, and as friends of Trotsky they were all welcomed by the local leftist guerrillas. Ruby was bothered that Geronimo seemed to have disappeared, but shrugged it off as part of the Spaniard's often melancholy need to be alone.<br/><br/>They were sitting down to a wonderful meal of local Mayan dishes when a young man came running into the village, shouting in Mayan and Spanish. Everyone gathered around him. He had brought a copy of the International Herald Tribune from a few days ago which had a front-page story about the destruction of a Basque market town named Guernica by the Germans.<br/><br/>Dr. Orange found himself stared in an unfriendly way by the villagers, who seemed to want to find and hurt a German, even if he was a Social Democrat. He went to Nic and asked her to try and calm them down. "I'm on your side," he pleaded. "I was fighting the Nazis in the 1920s!"<br/><br/><i>[I offered an Oral History spend to give an inspiring speech, but OP was content with using Oral History to calm people down enough to keep them from trying to lynch him.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/>Geronimo still hadn't turned up by evening. Ruby spent some time pensively watching the jungle. "Where do you think he could be?" she asked Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Safe," he said immediately. "He can take care of himself. Maybe he had to go do something important...but you can bet that he was thinking of you when he did it."<br/><br/>Ruby nodded and turned away toward her tent.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>The next day they set out into the broiling, steamy forests of the Yucat\xe1n. Ruby, a veteran of previous trips into the African and Asian jungles, was the only one not immediately miserable; even Millicent, who still remembered growing up in Singapore, was wilting.<br/><br/>"I hate the jungle," muttered Jimmy. "Why do I keep ending up in them?"<br/><br/>"This is ridiculous," complained Dr. Orange. "Ridiculous!"<br/><br/>"Didn't you study archaeology?" asked Millicent. "Doesn't this interest you at all?"<br/><br/>"Ja, ja, it's great. I'm sweating in places I didn't know could sweat! Why can't we just study books on this, like a real archaeologist?"<br/><br/>Every mile cost them untold sweat and hard labor; they were blazing a trail through practically untouched jungle, but slowly they cut their way through it. On the third day of the expedition, they came upon a beat up truck in a clearing, parked near a muddy skid trail.<br/><br/>Jimmy searched the cab. He found some spent brass from a rifle, and what looked like a bullet hole in the door.<br/><br/>"Somebody tried to hotwire the truck," said Dr. Orange, pointing to the wires dangling below the dashboard. "And the distributor is missing."<br/><br/>"I don't know they're related," said Jimmy. "Locals might have tried to strip it after whoever these guys were bought it."<br/><br/>"Look at all the overgrowth around the truck," said Ruby. "It's probably been here for a month or so."<br/><br/>"Right when Brooks' expedition was in the area," said Jimmy.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Just before they pitched camp they came across their first artifact--a heavily carved column in the Mayan style, broken near the top.<br/><br/>"This wasn't Mayan," said Dr. Orange. "But it was designed to warn them. The top probably had some kind of head or other image on it, but it looks like someone broke it off."<br/><br/><i>[Archaeology use by OP.]</i><br/><br/>"Think it was looters?" asked Jimmy. "Or archaeologists?"<br/><br/>"What?"<br/><br/>"I knew an archaeologist once...that would have been his style."<br/><br/>They pitched camp near the pillar. The porters sang quietly by the fire, strumming a guitar for accompaniment. Dr. Orange took a few turns around the clearing. He stared into the gloomy jungle, stopped for a second, and then ambled over to Jimmy's tent.<br/><br/>Jimmy rolled awake when Dr. Orange kicked the tent pole. "There's somebody watching us," said the German.<br/><br/>"Wait here," said Jimmy, throwing on his pistol holster. "I'll find Nic."<br/><br/>Dr. Orange shrugged, waited for Jimmy to leave the tent, and then plunged into the jungle, creeping as quietly as he could through the forest. It had rained recently and water dripped from the leaves all around him, sparking silver in the moonlight. Up ahead he saw two figures standing in a shadowy clearing, quietly talking to each other. But as he tried to get near to them, they suddenly fell silent.<br/><br/>He turned around and ran back to the camp. Behind him, he heard crashing sounds as if the two people he had seen were running away from him as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448664/#Comment_448664" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-21T16:27:12+00:00" title="September 21, 2015  4:27PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VII: As the Gloom Begins To Fall (Part 10)</b><br/><br/>"Where's Nic?" said Jimmy to Millicent.<br/><br/>"I haven't seen her."<br/><br/>"Damnit. Listen, tell everyone to be on their guard. Somebody's watching us. Don't make a big deal out of it, just make sure everyone is ready. Where could Nic be?"<br/><br/>Dr. Orange stumbled into camp. "They heard me!" he panted.<br/><br/>"Who?" demanded Ruby.<br/><br/>"I don't know! There's always a <i>they</i>."<br/><br/>At just that moment, Nic came walking out of the jungle on the other side of the camp.<br/><br/>"What's going on?" she said.<br/><br/>"We're being watched," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"There are a lot of Indians in the jungle."<br/><br/>"We're the twitchy sort," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"You're paranoid even for gringos."<br/><br/>"You know these Indians?"<br/><br/>"I don't know every single Indian in the Yucat\xe1n."<br/><br/>"But you know the area, right?" said Dr. Orange. "So let's go see who's watching us."<br/><br/>"I don't think that would be a good idea."<br/><br/>"Could they be hostile?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"There's always the possibility of hostility when you travel across other people's land."<br/><br/>"And where were you, exactly?" said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"I was checking on things. I am the guide. Do you want me to stop doing my job? I can just stop here--you know the way from here."<br/><br/>Ruby shook her head. "She's not telling us everything," she whispered to her companions.<br/><br/><i>[Assess Honesty use.]</i><br/><br/>"Let's gather the mob and light some torches, wave some pitchforks," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"Pitchforks?" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Metaphorically."<br/><br/>"The mob that she hand-picked, and speak Mayan?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"We know where we're going! We can make it the rest of the way!"<br/><br/>"Herr doktor," said Ruby, "where's the sun going to come up tomorrow? You don't know, do you?"<br/><br/>"So what! We can do this! We've got hostages!"<br/><br/>"No. <i>They've</i> got hostages. We're in <i>their</i> territory. We are <i>their</i> guests. Or their prisoners."<br/><br/><i>[I ruled that Ruby was basically using Flattery unintentionally here to defuse the situation.]</i><br/><br/>"Fine, you deal with it!" huffed Dr. Orange. He dove back inside his tent.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Jimmy regarded Nic carefully. He didn't think she was being hostile, but he didn't know why she had concealed what she was doing. He walked up to her calmly and said, "You understand. We're in a place that's foreign to us. But we got you those rifles--you know we've seen a lot of action. So being watched in an unfamiliar place, and then having you not be completely honest about where you were--that's going to put us on edge."<br/><br/><i>[Me: Wow, that sounds really Reassuring.]</i><br/><br/>"You want to know what I was doing?" said Nic. "Fine, come with me. If you trust me."<br/><br/>They walked into the dark forest, stepping off the trail and into the underbrush. After a short but difficult passage they burst into a tiny clearing. An old native woman was sitting by a small charcoal fire, singing atonally as she stirred a pot hung over the fire.<br/><br/>"This is Estrella," said Nic. "She's a wise woman of the Xoxul tribe. She was telling me about the new danger that appeared in the area a few years ago."<br/><br/>"New danger?"<br/><br/>"You understand that Chichen Xoxul has always been a haunted place. But in the last fifteen years or so, there's some new terror that inhabits this place. Some people say it's a ghost, some say it's an animal...but whatever it is, it doesn't seem to be a creature of the waking world. I think it was dragged from the Mayan dreamtime myself. I'm superstitious that way."<br/><br/>Nic turned and said something to Estrella in Xoxul. The old woman replied, and Nic struggled to translate. "It looks like...something toadlike....or birdlike...maybe like a jaguar. I was trying to decide if we should go forward--Estrella has always been right about everything she's said to me. Well, except my ex-husband. If I didn't like what I heard this time, I was going to get us 'lost' tomorrow."<br/>"And what was your decision?"<br/><br/>"I hadn't made up my mind yet. And then my men said something about you planning to murder us all..."<br/><br/>"No one was planning to murder you."<br/><br/>"I assume that's what the German was saying. You know how they are."<br/><br/>"Oh, him. He's had too much sun."<br/><br/>"...all right. I'll take you to Chichen Xoxul. I don't think my men will want to accompany you inside, however."<br/><br/>As they left the clearing, Estrella called out something.<br/><br/>"She wants to know your name," said Nic.<br/><br/>"Jimmy Wright."<br/><br/>Estrella started laughing. "Jimmy, ha ha ha ha..." She said something in Xoxul.<br/><br/>Nic looked puzzled. "What does 'the rest of the rabbit' mean?" she said.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Jimmy came back to camp to find Ruby and Millicent giving an impromptu reading of <i>Lady's Chatterly's Lover</i>, translating it rather freely into Spanish as they read.

Ruby was near the front of the group, taking her turn hacking the underbrush with a machete. Suddenly she dropped her blade and flung herself at Millicent, knocking her to the ground.<br/><br/>A fusillade broke out from the trees ahead of them. Some porters collapsed, bleeding. A few more rifle shots rang out, forcing them to keep flat to the ground.<br/><br/>"They'll try and swing some people behind us to catch us in a crossfire," said Dr. Orange. "Old Nazi trick."<br/><br/>Jimmy crawled away from the rest of the group and into the forest. Millicent scrambled after him. "Damnit," he said. "You can come with, just stay quiet. If anything happens, head back to the rest."<br/><br/>Millicent crawled ahead of Jimmy and then loped off like a deer into the woods. Once again Jimmy was surprised at her tradecraft--she was barely making any noise, and he could hardly keep up. Suddenly she stopped and slid behind a tree, making a small, quiet motion with her hand.<br/><br/>Jimmy threw himself behind the trunk of a banana tree. He could see three men creeping through the woods, two carrying rifles and one a shotgun. The third man was also holding a bundle of dynamite.<br/><br/>He braced his rifle against the tree, measured his lead, and then emptied his rifle at the three men. Both riflemen went down with terrible head wounds.<br/><br/>The third man dropped his shotgun and dynamite and raised his hands. "I surrender!" he said.<br/><br/><i>[So, using the Ammo rules I've made, Jimmy (with his Firearms rating of 10) was able to burn off all the rounds in his rifle since he had Ammo 1. JP also spent some Firearms points to do more damage, which is my standard rule--spend them before the roll to add extra damage.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Ruby crept up a little bit and peered through the jungle underbrush. She could catch quick glimpses of the riflemen who had ambushed them. There seemed to be no more than four or five of them. All of them looked like local <i>campesinos</i>, except for one man who wore a clean white shirt and carried a fancy hunting rifle.<br/><br/>"Guillermo?" said Ruby to herself. "I'm glad we didn't hire that jerk." She raised her rifle and put a bullet in his chest. He fell hard to the ground, bleeding badly.<br/><br/>Dr. Orange stood up and started screaming in German in the most intimidating way possible--which was considerable. The surviving riflemen faded back into the woods as Jimmy came prodding his prisoner out of the woods.<br/><br/>Dr. Orange dragged Castillo out from the trees and threw him to the ground. "Who the hell is this guy?" he asked.<br/><br/>"A guide," said Ruby. "Did de la Vega send you?" she said to Castillo.<br/><br/>"No..." he panted. He had a bad chest wound. "I came to kill you because you didn't hire me. I do that to keep people away from here. I tell everyone they're bandits. It always works, when you hire me you never meet any bandits..."<br/><br/>Ruby's face grew hard. "We should just tie you to a tree and leave you to die," she said. "But I have a better idea. We're going to patch you up...and give you to Nic."<br/><br/>"Don't worry," Nic said with a smirk. "We'll take <i>excellent</i> care of you."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>They pushed forward. After a few hours they came across another warning pillar, but this one still had the capstone, which depicted a...toadlike...creature with a large mouth that was using its tongue to accept the head of a sacrifice. But something was wrong--the mouth of the statue had changed somehow. Its mouth no longer fit with the style of the rest of the pillar, having been replaced by a lipless, grinning, snaggle-toothed mouth that looked familiar to them all. Most unnervingly, this changed mouth <i>didn't seem to have been carved later</i>. But how could that be?<br/><br/>"I've read my dad's notes," said Nic. "They didn't used to look like that. The mouth is...wrong."<br/><br/>"It's a lie," said Millicent. "The stone is trying to lie."<br/><br/>"We're close," said Jimmy. He unrolled the map of Chichen Xoxul that de la Vega had given him. "These columns here," he said, pointing to a an odd assortment of columns on the east of the site, "they're pretty close. Let's go on through there."<br/><br/>"This is where we leave you," said Nic. "We'll wait a full day...if you don't come back by then, you're probably not going to come back at all."<br/><br/>"Fair enough," said Jimmy.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448680/#Comment_448680" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-22T16:10:51+00:00" title="September 22, 2015  4:10PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VII: As the Gloom Begins To Fall (Part 11)</b><br/><br/>As they approached Chichen Xoxul, Jimmy noticed something odd--the forest had become quiet. He didn't hear the constant background chatter of birds and monkeys. He didn't even hear the whine of insects. It was like animals didn't live in the area at all.<br/><br/>In the overgrowth ahead a stone column suddenly loomed up. They pushed through the grass and found themselves on a broad pediment, strangely untouched by the jungle. The place was a jumble of square Mayan-style columns, everyone carved with hieroglyphics and petroglyphs. The tops of the columns were stylized skulls of men and animals.<br/><br/>On a few of the columns they saw actual skulls. They looked human.<br/><br/>To their right was a small stepped pyramid. Some low walls to the left looked like they were the remains of a Mesoamerican ball game court. In between the three sites was a broad plaza flagged with large stones, covered with high stands of grass.<br/><br/>Then they found the heads.<br/>Perched up on top of several columns were the severed heads of Mexican men. They had looks of terror on their faces. They looked to be about a month old.<br/><br/>"That one there," said Jimmy. "That looks like the description we got of that guide that disappeared. The one that led Brooks' expedition."<br/><br/>"Mr. Wright," said Millicent, "something's moving in the plaza."<br/><br/>"What did you see?"<br/><br/>"I saw something move between those pillars over there...but I didn't see it before it passed the pillar, or after it passed that other pillar...it was like it wasn't there before!"<br/><br/>"Run," said Jimmy, sprinting forward.<br/><br/>Ruby and Dr. Orange scampered down into the plaza and took off in the direction of the well, plunging into the thick brush that surrounded the cenote. Jimmy and Millicent moved slower, trying to keep their guard up.<br/><br/><i>[Ruby and the doc used Fleeing, so they went where I sent 'em. Jimmy &amp; Millicent used Athletics, so they didn't get as far away, but were on their guard.]</i><br/><br/>Something suddenly came into view on top of the pyramid. Jimmy was sure it hadn't been there a second ago. It was...toad-like, somehow, about the size of a car, crouched like a jaguar. Its tail...tails....flicked around in the air in a manner disturbingly like a housecat stalking a mouse. It opened its mouth, revealing row after row of razor-sharp teeth, and then <i>projected</i> a long, sticky tongue that was at least half its length. It gathered itself for a leap...and vanished.<br/><br/><i>[3 point Stability loss for Jimmy and Millicent.]</i><br/><br/>"I don't want it here. I don't want it here. I don't want it here..." muttered Millicent.<br/><br/><i>[Me: Roll a d6 and spend as many points of Cthulhu Mythos as you like...]</i><br/><br/>A shadow crossed the sun. Jimmy saw the creature above him, looking like it was finishing its leap. Millicent raised her hand, and the creature was engulfed in a ball of green slime and thrown with enormous force into the forest.<br/><br/>Jimmy spun and stared at Millicent. Her face was chalk pale and her lip was trembling.<br/><br/>"Come on," he said. "Let's find the others."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>They found Ruby and the doctor standing on the edge of the well. "Take a look at this," said Ruby. "You won't like it."<br/><br/>The well was a typically rimless Mesoamerican well, but the mouth of the well looked like...a mouth. Or a Mouth, frozen in stone, with the same lipless grimace they had seen too many times already.<br/><br/>At the bottom of the well there was still water, and something gold glinted in the dimness.<br/><br/>Jimmy uncoiled some rope from his pack. "You guys lower me down," he said. "I'm going to take a look."<br/><br/>He rappelled down the sides of the well, which were slick with slime and moss. About thirty feet down he found a small cross hanging off a bit of projecting stone. The chain was too small for an adult. On the back was engraved <i>Salvador</i>.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/>He handed the cross to Millicent as soon as they pulled him back up. "I saw a cave leading from the bottom of the well," he said. "Went in the general direction of the pyramid."<br/><br/>"Salvador means Savior in Spanish," said Millicent. "But it was also the name of Echevarr\xeda's son, the one that died."<br/><br/>Dr. Orange was watching the plaza. To his surprise, he saw a man come walking out of the underbrush, dressed at what he could identify as the everyday clothes of a Mayan from seven hundred years ago. The man walked towards the well, not paying any attention to Dr. Orange and his friends. Suddenly he stopped, with a frightened expression on his face. He pointed at Millicent...and vanished.<br/><br/>"Ghost..." said Ruby, looking at Jimmy, who shrugged. "Jimmy, when nobody else knows, you're our expert!"<br/><br/>"It looked like he was just here to use the well," said Dr. Orange. As he spoke, the faint sound of drums and flutes was heard from the plaza.<br/><br/>All of them watched as a large procession marched into the plaza, dressed in brightly colored feathered cloaks and long woven robes. Drummers followed them, and men were blowing into conch shells.<br/><br/>"Do they see us?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>Ruby picked up a stone and threw it at an unoccupied corner of the plaza. Several people started, as if they had heard it, and a few turned around and pointed at Ruby. One man armed with an obsidian sword burst out of the crowd, running towards them, and another man raised a blowgun and shot a dart at Ruby.<br/><br/>The dart passed through her shoulder like she wasn't there, and the entire procession vanished.<br/><br/>"What does everyone know about ghosts," she said. "Let's discuss that now."<br/><br/>"I met one once," muttered Jimmy. "Gimme a minute...I'm thinking. It's not just a phantom shift, where you see stuff repeating...but this is different...they could see us, sometimes...I think we're actually observing things that are happening. Or happened."<br/><br/><i>[Cthulhu Mythos spend by JP, 2 Stability since JP didn't want to go all the way for the answer. (I usually ask my players just how much they want to lose and give them answers based on what they say.)]</i><br/><br/>"We should head to the pyramid," said Ruby. "We have loud banging sticks, that should scare off any Xoxul warrior. And I'll bet you anything we'll find out what's on top of the pyramid."<br/><br/>"Imagine what we could learn if we could contact the past," said Dr. Orange. "We have to go on."<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448701/#Comment_448701" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-23T18:20:01+00:00" title="September 23, 2015  6:20PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VII: As the Gloom Begins To Fall (Part 12)</b><br/><br/>They crossed the plaza, Jimmy nervously covering them with his gun and spinning around to see if they were followed. The pyramid was...odd. The decorations at the base were typically Mayan, but as the pyramid ascended, it was clear that someone had altered the artwork. Dr. Orange assumed that it was the Xoxul. As they climbed the steps, he could make out the story they represented, of a Xoxul sorcerer who had built the pyramid in a single day.<br/><br/>He also saw some odd looking slits carved into the side of the pyramid. He could tell they had been done after the pyramid had been built. As he peered at them, he saw some movement--and then the sound of a pistol being cocked. He leaped back as a shot rang out.<br/><br/>On the top of the pyramid, Ruby was suddenly confronted by several Xoxul warriors who hadn't been there a moment ago. "We are friends from the future," she said hopefully.<br/><br/>One of the warriors slashed at her with his war club, but it passed right through her. "Oh, that's spooky," she said, jumping back.<br/><br/>"That gunshot was definitely not from 1500," said Dr. Orange. "You can smell the cordite. Someone is inside the temple!"<br/><br/>"I just saw ghosts trying to kill me," said Ruby. "Give me a moment."<br/><br/>"Let's move," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>There was a small boxlike structure on top of the pyramid, open on one side. Jimmy pulled back both hammers on his shotgun and stepped through the entrance.<br/><br/>Inside he could see a gigantic altar, carved with what Dr. Orange had told him were Xoxul hieroglyphics. In front of the altar, flush with the floor, was a large red disc of some metal that he couldn't identify. The rest of the chamber had a strange lack of decoration.<br/><br/>He looked closer at the altar. It was carved in the form of a man on all fours, his wrists and ankles bound, with a large bowl on his back.<br/><br/>"That's the inversion of the chacmool figure," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"And those are bloodstains, very old," said Dr. Orange. "Look at the grooves carved from the bowl, leading to that disk."<br/><br/>"You recognize that?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"It's definitely not the sun or the moon, but those radiating lines...they're <i>like</i> the sun..."<br/><br/>"Dr. Orange, look--there's a seam in the middle, it's really fine. I think it can hinge down like a trap door," said Millicent<br/><br/>"Lemme try something," said Jimmy. He uncorked his canteen and poured it out into the bowl. Water drained down out of the bowl and flowed through the grooves on the floor.<br/><br/>There was a shuddering creak and the disk suddenly split in two and each half swung down into the floor, revealing a pit of some kind. At the bottom of it was a man aiming a gun at him.<br/><br/>Jimmy put a round into the ground at his feet. "No me maten, no me maten!" he shouted, dropping his pistol.<br/><br/>They all dropped down into the room below. "Agua, por favor," said the man. Millicent handed him her canteen. "My name is Vasquez, I was sent here by Se\xf1or Brooks. Then the ghosts attacked...and the creature. It won't go inside buildings...I think. So I hid in here. I thought I was going to die, it's been three days since I locked myself in and I ran out of water."<br/><br/>"Three days?" said Dr. Orange. "You've been gone more than a month."<br/><br/>"How could that be, a month? I would have died of thirst!"<br/><br/>"I don't understand," said Millicent. Ruby threw an arm over his shoulder consolingly. "I've seen many strange things," moaned Vasquez.<br/><br/>Dr. Orange turned on his flashlight. "Looks like this is where they kept the carvings," he muttered. Most of the carvings were rather typical of other Mesoamerican sites he had read about...but then he found one that gave him pause.<br/><br/>"Jimmy, look," he said. "See? A large circle, then four small circles...then four larger circles. And the sixth one has a line drawn through it, see!"<br/><br/>"I don't get it."<br/><br/>"It's the solar system, don't you understand? That third one is Earth, the sixth one Saturn!"<br/><br/>Jimmy shook his head. "But...how? Uranus wasn't discovered until the 18th Century!"<br/><br/><i>[Me: Doc, would you like to make a Physics spend?</i><br/><i>OP: I would </i>love<i> to make a Physics spend! It's what I'm about!]</i><br/><br/>Dr. Orange found another strange illustration nearby, showing a large circle and then a smaller circle at some distance. A line was drawn between them, with the glyph for a campfire and a number.<br/><br/>"One...85,000th...no, 86,000th...that's...a second...that's...that's...the distance between the earth and the moon, measured in light seconds. In light seconds!"<br/><br/>Enraptured, he pored over every inch of the walls. Finally he pulled the rest of them over. "Look, I'm a pilot and an engineer. This section here? Every time I look at it I feel like...this is some kind of control panel. See, those bits here rotate, like dials? And there's a lever here..."<br/><br/>They all looked at each other. "Well..." said Dr. Orange.

Something...happened. They felt movement without movement, a sense of <i>translation</i>. The light changed, dimming and brightening faster and faster. Then they stopped.<br/><br/>Millicent peered through the slits. The pyramid was gone, and they seemed to be hovering over a shallow sea. The air was hot and damp. She looked up into the sky and saw a star that was growing brighter and brighter, even though judging by the daylight it looked like it was around midday.<br/><br/>"Mr. Wright," she said. "Look at that."<br/><br/>Jimmy looked through the slit. "Get this thing out of here!" he yelled. "That's a meteor coming right at us!"<br/><br/>"Was that a <i>dinosaur</i> that just flew by?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Not again," moaned Vasquez.<br/><br/>Dr. Orange manipulated some dials and pulled the lever...\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>They had that same odd feeling of motion without motion. Then the light grew dim, and the air very cold. They found themselves gasping for breath, as if there was somehow not enough oxygen in the air. Snow filtered through the slits in the walls.<br/><br/>"Ahh," said Dr. Orange, not sweating for the first time in weeks. "That's more like it."<br/><br/>They all rushed to the slits and looked out. They seemed to be on top of a very high pyramid, itself on top of a very high mountain. Snow and ice was all around them.<br/><br/>"Based on the air, I think we're four or five thousand meters," said Dr. Orange. "No place in North America, I think. Maybe the Andes?"<br/><br/>"James, I'm cold," said Ruby. "Fix it."<br/><br/>Jimmy grabbed Vasquez by the collar. "You said, 'not again'. This happened before?"<br/><br/>"The room...goes places. I don't think I've been here before."<br/><br/>"We need to go someplace else, but the particular place we left," said Jimmy. "Doc, can you do that?"<br/><br/>"Sure, I'll just figure out the ancient Mayan <i>time machine</i>," said Dr. Orange. "But...let's see...I'm pretty sure the settings were like this when we left."<br/><br/>He fiddled with the dials, and then Jimmy threw the lever...<br/><br/><i>[I was charging a point of Cthulhu Mythos each time they activated the lever, but the group had a lot of it...]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>When the device stopped this time, they felt humid air wash over them, the familiar Yucat\xe1n jungle atmosphere. "I'm happy...I guess," said Dr. Orange. The rest of them grinned, and Ruby came up to shake the doctor's hand for bringing them home.<br/><br/>Then they heard the sound of conches blowing, and drums being pounded. Jimmy looked out of the slits. A ritual possession much like the one they had seen before was marching across the great plaza of Chichen Xoxul. There was none of the grassy overgrowth he had seen before--everything was neat and well-maintained.<br/><br/>Some red drops began to fall from the seam in the trap door. Suddenly, it swung down. Two men wearing feathered cloaks stared down at them in surprise, holding the body of a man who had just had his throat cut between them.<br/><br/>Ruby fired a warning shot at them with her pistol. From the slits a spear narrowly missed gutting her, and two men with obsidian swords jumped into the chamber with them. Two others hovered around the edge of the pit, waiting for an opportunity to climb inside.<br/><br/>Dr. Orange swung his rifle around, trying to get it to bear on the closest one, but the warrior managed to slip his sword under the gun and push it out of the way. The other warrior smashed the back of his leg, throwing him to the ground. He just managed to twist away before he could be hamstrung by the stone knife the warrior carried.<br/><br/>Jimmy fired off the other barrel of his shotgun, blowing away one of the men holding down Dr. Orange. The two warriors still in the sacrificial chamber stopped trying to climb into the pit for a moment, and Jimmy seized the moment to slam the trap doors up into place.<br/><br/>The remaining warrior stared at Ruby with a look of surprise and confusion on his face. Ruby drew her machete and swung it at him, but the warrior caught her blade on the handle of his own.<br/><br/>From outside the pyramid, they heard a man yell in archaic Spanish, "Wait! The great queen wants to speak to the European outsiders!"<br/><br/>Before anyone could say anything in reply, Millicent threw the lever.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>This time it was different. The room gave a shudder, and everything vanished, leaving them hanging in a lightless, weightless void. This wasn't the emptiness of outer space; this was utter and complete <i>nothingness</i>, without any light, any air, any senses at all. They floated in total silence, unable to even hear their own thoughts. And this lasted for a second, for an eternity, for no time, for all of time. It was just long enough to drive them all completely insane.<br/><br/>There was nothing left but the blackness, as it always was, and always would be. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448729/#Comment_448729" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-24T17:12:08+00:00" title="September 24, 2015  5:12PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You are a cruel GM and/or chronicler. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448734/#Comment_448734" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-24T19:49:06+00:00" title="September 24, 2015  7:49PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, heck, I never know if anyone is reading this anymore--commentary has been quiet this run <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>We're on session 11 now with the same PCs, so this isn't the end of things; but the encounter they have later is spread out a bit, so I was planning to dole it out slowly, not the least because I still don't have the next episode transcribed.

They couldn't feel or understand anything. But the Other was curious. It wanted to know. And that need created a <i>pressure</i>, prodding them into the gradual realization that there were <i>things</i> in the universe, two at least: them, and the Other.<br/><br/>Slowly, ever so slowly.<br/><br/>Sparks against the dark. Not sensation yet, just awareness. And yet the Other persisted, pushing, trying to understand, creating a waveform. As if it were searching for something, some key, some way of knowing.<br/><br/>And then it found music. They of course didn't know what music was, but out of the vaguest mathematical and theoretical postulates things became more and more comprehensible, the Other changing and adjusting, fitting itself into a shape or a form until finally with the dimmest spark of light that nevertheless blazed over them like a supernova, a chord burst forth: singing, rising, praising, pulling them in, giving shape to their most inchoate sensations and perceptions. Music flowed, snatches of counterpoint like Bach fugues made out of crystal, until multiple voices, instruments, tones played through the darkness and they knew themselves as separate from the Other and different and whole in of themselves.<br/><br/>Floods of memories woke in them. They began to reassemble their mental maps of the world, to know sensation, to know thought. And slowly, infinitesimally their egos began to separate. They still didn't know who they were, but the first painful realization that they were different entities began, filling the void with the sweet sadness of existence.

The iteration of the Messenger can only exist when the question may be asked. When the question may not be asked or CANnot be asked or willnot be asked, then the Messenger isnot. Ah. Yes. We have the clarification. When a species understands that the universe is more than what its sensoria can reveal, why, that's when the Messenger is going to appear. You see...Gol-Goroth is not so great at talking to monkeys.

So while thinking a lot about this encounter, I eventually came up with the Fisher's rather odd personality and equally odd delivery. I can't really capture it orthographically; it was a sing-song, high-pitched voice with the emPHASis put on odd syllables and a lot of words runtogether. Also, GG spoke with a lot of non sequiturs and technobabble.</i><br/><br/><i>My reasoning is that it is a being that is outside linear time and so communication was extremely difficult. It was music that ended up providing the initial bridge to the PCs; the mathematical language of music, which is coupled with memory and emotion for most people, was understandable in some fashion to Gol-Goroth and that was how the PCs egos were reassembled. (OP noted that I was echoing Sartre with the self only understandable in opposition to others...maybe I should have called </i>this<i> campaign post-modern too.</i><br/><br/><i>That whole section evolved in my mind over a while, because I didn't want the encounter to happen too quickly. I also embedded some clues in the locations they jumped too: the Yucat\xe1n before the K-T event was to demonstrate they'd moved in time but not space, the mountain pyramid is foreshadowing, and at least part of me thought maybe they'd try to find out who "the great Queen" was. Well, it will come back later, probably.</i><br/><br/><i>I don't generally use music during my sessions, but I actually had a queue for this session, when the first realization of music came upon them in the void--the Introit for Faure's Requiem in D Minor. I found a recording where the attack on the initial organ chord was nice and loud, and gave a real sense of suddenly breaking through darkness. It would have been nice to find an appropriate Bach piece, but I didn't have time to trawl through the organ catalog (I'm more a fan of his keyboard pieces on piano in any case.) That said, it's Bach that formed the bridge to their shattered egos, so probably they have Dr. Orange's bourgeois German upbringing to thank. (Hey, I'm from a bourgeois German family; I can tell, because just about every member of my immediate family, including me, has a piano.)</i><br/><br/><i>There were some mechanical things that came out of the freely RPed scenes where they explored each other's memories--I offered a point of Stability for a happy memory, or a point of Sanity for a sad memory, because paradoxically, sad memories did more to remind them of the human condition. Everyone took the bad memory option, and we put that in a pool they could use after we did the final tally on Stability loss. (I didn't bother until the end of the sequence.)</i><br/><br/><i>It worked out to be a nine point Stability loss, which put everyone at Shaken and thus they lost a point of Sanity. However, I gave them back a point of Sanity for frequently blacking out and generally not really acknowledging how terrible it was--basically, the fainting option we did in Mexico City and yes I know that's not how the rule works but it was working for us. So while everyone was Shaken by this Ur-Mythos Shock, with the point back for blacking out nobody was actually down any Sanity. Ruby clawed back three points out of the pool of Sanity (Jimmy took the other point) and as you'll see she justified this with a number of changes to her character.</i><br/><br/><i>There's another mechanical benefit but we'll get to that in a bit.]</i><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448830/#Comment_448830" name="Item_118" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-30T15:57:56+00:00" title="September 30, 2015  3:57PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VIII: No Maze to Unwind (Part 7)</b><br/><br/>"Julius! Wake up!"<br/><br/>Dr. Orange opened his eyes and sat up groggily. "Max..." he muttered. "It's good to see you."<br/><br/>"You said you were going to Mexico..."<br/><br/>"I was in Mexico."<br/><br/>"Did you fly back?"<br/><br/>"...I took a train."<br/><br/>"However, I'm not sure how you got here. The guards don't allow anyone without a white pass into this section."<br/><br/>"Must have been on a coffee break?"<br/><br/>"Julius...it's somewhat interesting that you showed up like this...but you understand that if I tell you anything I am putting my career, and potentially my freedom and my life on the line?"<br/><br/>"Or they'll kill us, I'm used to that."<br/><br/>"Ja, it's like the old country. Come with me to the lab."<br/><br/>They walked into a section of Caltech that Dr. Orange hadn't even suspected existed. ("There's no sub-basement 2!") Dr. Born led him into a lab crammed with unusual machinery. Eerie green light shone from some sort of beam projector in the center of the room.<br/><br/>"Yesterday, we put a rabbit here. In theory we teleported it."<br/><br/>"In theory? What theory?"<br/><br/>"...I'll get to that. I just know that we ported it. It's not disintegration until 72 hours have passed according to the experimental protocols. Since then, a number of...unusual events have occurred."<br/><br/>"Such as?"<br/><br/>"I had a thirty second conversation with Leland Stanford. I thought that was a little weird."<br/><br/>"Maybe I should catch you up on what I've been doing," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"Ja, and I can read you the requirements for Project Philadelphia."<br/><br/>They talked for several hours. Dr. Born explained that back in 1926 the British Navy recovered a lot of odd equipment in the middle of the Indian Ocean, eventually sharing some of their discoveries with the Americans. These mostly related to teleportation, the opening of portals in spacetime, and other even weirder ideas--possibly including time travel. There is also some ballistics research going on; one of the finds was a piece of a rocket of some kind.<br/><br/>"I can't get in on this right now," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"I understand. But I'm glad you know; it might be useful to have a man on the outside. I'm sure we can work out some kind of code. But of course...deportation, espionage, etc."<br/><br/>"Let me tell you what I've been working on," began Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>He talked for almost two hours almost without interruption. "...and that's how I ended up in your office," he concluded.<br/><br/><i>[Me: Julius, you understand I don't have PC stability!]</i><br/><br/>"You...spoke to an extradimensional intelligence?"<br/><br/>"I spoke to someone who said, hey--Grand Unified Theory, just call this number."<br/><br/>"Did he mention the name of the entity?"<br/><br/>"The Messenger or something like that."<br/><br/>"We should research this..."<br/><br/>"Based on my experience, we shouldn't."<br/><br/>"But Julius! Think what we could know! We could have flying cars by 1950!"<br/><br/>"If we don't do the research for this knowledge, then we don't deserve it. We have to know how to <i>not</i> know it first. That's science."<br/><br/>"Damnit, you always paid more attention to Karl Popper than me!"<br/><br/>A rabbit suddenly fell at their feet.<br/><br/>"A rabbit!" said Dr. Orange. "It's freeze-dried, I notice."<br/><br/>"Ja...and it's a different rabbit than the one we sent. But you know what that means..."<br/><br/>"A result!" they chorused together.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Ruby sat in her hotel room, writing furiously in a little journal. She was pushing to get every last bit of information about what had happened to her since January. She spent most of two days working on it, ending with a note saying goodbye to Murphy, along with the name of their daughter and where he could find her.<br/><br/>Charlie drove her to the train station. "It is not an easy thing," he said, "to come back from the dreamtime."<br/><br/>"No...it has not been easy."<br/><br/>"Are you sure you are making the right decision with regards to Captain Murphy?"<br/><br/>"I feel that...we love one another, but we also hurt one another. And if I keep bringing him into the crazy life that I found for myself...it will only hurt him even more."<br/><br/>"With all due respect, that is a strange sentiment to come from you, Miss Ruby."<br/><br/>"I'm not the same person I was before...my experience."<br/><br/>"One cannot be, when one has been through the dreamtime."<br/><br/>He stopped the car in front of the station. "Wait a moment," he said as Ruby made to get out of the car. He took a necklace off his neck--a simple cord with a piece of smooth basalt for a pendant. "Please take this. It belonged to a great matriarch of my people."<br/><br/>"Thank you, Charlie," said Ruby, taken aback.<br/><br/><i>[RP was doing a couple of things here: first, Ruby voluntarily gave up Murphy as her Solace; second, the necklace became Ruby's new Symbol.]</i> <p></p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ver_Spot" title="Ver_Spot"><img alt="Ver_Spot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ver_Spot">Ver_Spot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448831/#Comment_448831" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-30T18:13:03+00:00" title="September 30, 2015  6:13PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            God I love playing Ruby.

He walked up to the pilot and stared in his eyes for a long moment.<br/><br/>The pilot and the cabbie shuddered simultaneously, and then the pilot turned to Millicent. "Come, kid, let's go."<br/><br/>Millicent fainted.<br/><br/>"That happens all the time," sighed the pilot. He administered a sleeper hold to the cabbie.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Millicent came to in the co-pilot's seat of a twin-engine shot-hop air freighter. "I don't know why humans need two pilots to run these things," said Kakakatak/pilot by way of greeting. "They're easy enough. Although I am getting a bit stiff.."<br/><br/>"I've been told I have a thing in my spine," said Millicent slowly.<br/><br/>"Oh, that. Yeah, that's true."<br/><br/>"Is that a good thing?"<br/><br/>"It was sort of necessary. What I should be doing, kid, is pulling over to one of those states....I dunno, is Missoultuckey a state? and rearranging your brain. That's dangerous too, although I could probably pull of the whole memory block thing. That's probably the safest course."<br/><br/>"Is it? I'm just going to end back up with Mr. Wright and we're fighting this...contaminant. Can I do that with my brain rearranged."<br/><br/>"It's not a really fine-toothed ability...it wasn't too hard to cut out about two years before, but now I don't know. I'm reasonably sure you'd remember your name. We encoded that pretty hard."<br/><br/>"Maybe it's not a good idea then.<br/>"You might be right. Where should I take you?"<br/><br/>"Do you know where Vanessa is?"<br/><br/>"Nope. Not omniscient, sorry. Close though."<br/><br/>"I guess Los Angeles is close enough."<br/><br/>Kakakatak/pilot yawned. "My jaw keeps doing that," he wondered. "Oh...right, that's fatigue. I always forget you guys need to sleep."<br/><br/>"You should probably land and rest a while."<br/><br/>"I've got a better idea."<br/><br/>The better idea, much to Millicent's relief, was to land and put her on a train. "I should probably not see Jimmy," said Kakakatak. "It's really dangerous."<br/><br/>"Should I tell him you say hello?"<br/><br/>"What did you say Ruby was wearing?"<br/><br/>"A pantsuit for the jungle."<br/><br/>"I <i>really</i> don't like that branch...but I'll see if I can look him up."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>After about a week Jimmy and Janet, posing as a happy Canadian married couple, made it back to Los Angeles. Jimmy laid low at one of his safe houses.<br/><br/>One day he got a call on the emergency line he had set up for people from the office to keep in touch with him. "Mr. Wright, you better get down here <i>right now</i>."<br/><br/>"I'm on my way." He, Janet, and Betty piled into a car and drove to the office.<br/><br/>When he arrived on his floor, he saw the doors had been knocked down and men in suits were milling around the reception area. A better-dressed version of them approached him. "James Wright?"<br/><br/>"Unfortunately."<br/><br/>"Summers, FBI. I got a warrant to search these premises."<br/><br/>"Come on in," said Jimmy, handing his hat to one of his secretaries. "But...oh, I see that you don't have your third copy of this form."<br/><br/>"I don't need that to serve you."<br/><br/>"I disagree. Thomas! Take a look at this," said Jimmy to his brother-in-law/corporate counsel.<br/><br/>"Clearly irregular," said Thomas in a thick French accent.<br/><br/>"Nuts to that," said Summers.<br/><br/>"Quoi?"<br/><br/><i>[Law spend by JP to let Jimmy get to his office ahead of the FBI.]</i><br/><br/>While they argued, Jimmy quietly slipped away and made his way to his office. He locked the double doors behind him. He had only minutes to hide the things in his vault safe.<br/><br/>"Lightning gun. Magic armor. Those books..." he muttered, running over his mental inventory. Behind him there was the sound of some FBI agents demanding he open the door.<br/><br/>Jimmy pulled out one key from the bunch he kept clipped to his belt and a penknife. With the knife he pried off the plate of one of the light switches, revealing a button and a small keyhole.<br/><br/>The doors began to shudder from the blows of what he assumed were fire axes.<br/><br/>He jammed the key into the lock, turned it, then pressed the button. There was the whine of hydraulics as inside the wall, his vault was lowered down in a manner remarkably similar to a dumbwaiter. The cycle had just finished as the door behind him shattered, giving him just enough time to pull out the key and press the switchplate back into place.<br/><br/>Assuming it had worked, he had lowered into a place a dummy safe, containing interesting but non-mystical papers, behind his vault door.<br/><br/>The agents burst into the room, shoving Jimmy up against the wall. One took an ax to his souvenir cabinet, breaking through the reinforced doors and then tipping it onto the floor. The pictures inside fell out and shattered on the ground.<br/><br/>Summers fished out the picture of Jimmy and a large group of people on a rundown tramp freighter. "Who are these people? Where were you when it was taken?"<br/><br/>"Oh that?" said Jimmy. "I was on vacation."<br/><br/>"You being smart with me?"<br/><br/>"Never."<br/><br/>One agent picked up a necklace with a bit of brass metal dangling from it. "What's this?" he said.<br/><br/>"Keepsake."<br/><br/>The agent shrugged and dropped it to the floor. Jimmy surreptitiously kicked it into a corner.<br/><br/>"We want to talk to you," said Summers, grabbing Jimmy by the collar. "Come on."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448843/#Comment_448843" name="Item_123" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-01T17:29:59+00:00" title="October  1, 2015  5:29PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>"Damnit, you always paid more attention to Karl Popper than me!"<br/></blockquote>\n[golf clap]<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448844/#Comment_448844" name="Item_124" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-01T17:39:43+00:00" title="October  1, 2015  5:39PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My favorite bit of that was "It's not disintegration until 72 hours have passed."<br/><br/>JP came up with the "It's not the same rabbit."<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448857/#Comment_448857" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-02T14:40:25+00:00" title="October  2, 2015  2:40PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VIII: No Maze to Unwind (Part 9)</b><br/><br/>After seventy two hours, they cut Jimmy loose, but his office was closed down.

Das macht mich verr\xfcckt</i>," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"<i>Das ist voll nervig</i>," agreed Millicent.<br/><br/>They all paused.<br/><br/>"What the hell just happened?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Were we all speaking <i>German</i>?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"I know German," said Millicent. "I didn't think you did!"<br/><br/>"I don't!" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Here, read this," said Dr. Orange, shoving a physics book at Jimmy.<br/><br/>"I...can't. It's in German...what gives?"<br/><br/>"Let me write something down. Do you know calculus?"<br/><br/>"No."<br/><br/>"Now, concentrate really hard. I know the answer to this problem...how would <i>I</i> solve it?"<br/><br/>"Integration," said Jimmy without missing a beat. "There, where the limit approaches zero...what the hell?"<br/><br/>"We must still be...linked, somehow," said Ruby. "From what...happened to us. Maybe we can...borrow each other's knowledge somehow."<br/><br/>They all stirred uncomfortably, trying not to remember what had happened to them.<br/><br/><i>[So, here's the other cherry from their journey beyond time and space: once per session, each PC  may spend Stability one-for-one to gain points another PC has; like borrowing Jimmy's Law or Dr. Orange's Physics. This hasn't been used that often yet, but it does come up in the next couple of sessions; plus it's a neat way to cover for missing players.]</i><br/><br/>"On that subject," said Millicent, "I met a friend of yours, Jimmy. Sort of."<br/><br/>"Could you narrow that down?"<br/><br/>"He was two guys," said Millicent miserably. "First one guy, then another guy."<br/><br/>"Oh, all right."<br/><br/>"I'm so glad that makes sense to you," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"I'm going to need to go back to the office to get...some things I need," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Could you use a hand?"<br/><br/>"All the hands I can get."<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448884/#Comment_448884" name="Item_126" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-05T16:01:13+00:00" title="October  5, 2015  4:01PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VIII: No Maze to Unwind (Part 10)</b><br/><br/>"Jimmy," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Not James?"<br/><br/>"No. Jimmy, you're my friend. We've been together on this trip. I've seen some of the things you deal with, and I want to help. There is something I am thinking of doing that we could work together on. It's a little more clandestine than we're used to, but I feel it would be a benefit not only to us, but to the rest of the world. I mean, this isn't the only problem like this that's going to happen, right? We're dealing with this now, but who knows what strange creatures are out there manipulating the world in ways that are even more terrifying! Read this."<br/><br/>While Jimmy looked over Ruby's documents with incredulity, Millicent leaned over to Dr. Orange. "Professor, are we really all just...math?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"I don't understand how a bunch of numbers can order a soda pop...even if the soda is just math too."<br/><br/>"Everything can be expressed digitally," said Dr. Orange. "Every single thing in the world."<br/><br/>"But why did the stock market crash if everything's numbers?"<br/><br/>"The Los Angeles Society for Archaeological Studies," said Jimmy. "What the hell?"<br/><br/>"Rich people like to do things with their money,\u201d said Ruby. \u201cWe can set this up to fund our own work. Create a tourist attraction for the things that are merely interesting, and everything that is <i>really</i> dangerous we'll bury deep where it can't be used to hurt people. Will you help me?"<br/><br/>"A non-profit would help some of my problems," mused Jimmy. "But I'm a PI, not an archaeologist."<br/><br/>"We'll need an investigator, though," said Ruby. "One who is well-traveled. I know the people who would be more than happy to donate. I'll be the face, you'll do the actual dark stuff. And we'll launder stuff--you've got a good accountant for that. What we're involved in is beyond the law."<br/><br/>"I don't care about breaking the law," said Millicent. "But we need to be able to get away with it."<br/><br/>"If we're careful, we can do it. I mean, we know someone in the California university system..."<br/><br/><i>[So, this is how we built LASAS:</i><br/><br/><i>--I required a 2-point Credit Rating spend</i><br/><br/><i>--Then a five-point combined spend from Law, Bureaucracy, Streetwise, or Credit Rating. I told the players I would note down what they spent, as it would affect the nature of the foundation--if there were a lot of Streetwise, that would mean something.</i><br/><br/><i>As it was, it went Law, Bureaucracy, Streetwise, Law, Library Use, and Archaeology (we negotiated the actual spends) plus Ruby threw in some Architecture to allow for some secret rooms in their fort.</i><br/><br/><i>Ruby used Cryptography to acquire an Enigma machine, which were commercially available.</i><br/><br/><i>Ruby and Jimmy split the Credit Rating spends, leaving them as two principal shareholders.</i><br/><br/><i>I pointed out that they would probably need an academic of some kind to be the front for the group, but we decided to figure that out later.</i><br/><br/><i>During that conversation, we noted Jimmy and Ruby had been kicked out of all the best schools.</i><br/><br/><i>RP: I was kicked out of Hogwarts.</i><br/><i>JP: Jimmy is such a Hufflepuff.</i><br/><i>Me: Really? Not Griffendor? Oh, I know. The Sorting Hat was like "Griff--" and Jimmy shouted "No! Hufflepuff! Hufflepuff!"]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Jimmy made plans to break into his office and retrieve his secret items from the safe. He borrowed a car from Ruby and set Betty up with a company car. "When we leave, you drive the company car away from the building and try and draw off anybody watching us, while I get away in the sports car."<br/><br/>"Good idea, Boss. By the way, do I still work for you?"<br/><br/>"Definitely."<br/><br/>"Good. Next question: am I going to become a private eye, or are we doing something different now? Like, maybe I'm going to need to be a soldier of fortune, like Miss Ruby."<br/><br/>"I have a fortune, and I shoot people," said Ruby. "I guess that's accurate."<br/><br/>"We're still a little fuzzy on that," sighed Jimmy, trying to ignore Ruby. "Just no matter what, you'll be taken care of."<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448894/#Comment_448894" name="Item_127" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-06T14:46:21+00:00" title="October  6, 2015  2:46PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VIII: No Maze to Unwind (Part 11)</b><br/><br/>The night of the break-in, Jimmy and Millicent went to the roof of the building next door the Mason building, where his office was located. He used a flashlight to signal to Dr. Orange, one building over and armed with a scoped rifle, that they were in position.<br/><br/>Then he threw a grappling hook over to the Mason Building. Millicent tied the rope down on their side and they shimmied across to the narrow ledge that ran around the tenth floor of the Mason Building.<br/><br/>"This is filthy," muttered Jimmy. A pigeon flew up in his face and he clung to the side of the building, startled. "I'm getting too old for this."<br/><br/>Millicent lightly ran ahead of him. He marveled again at her smooth grace. Following her, they came to the window of his office. He peered into the gloom inside. The Feds hadn't bothered to clean up their mess, but otherwise it looked empty.<br/><br/>A few minutes with his lockpick kit was all he needed to spring the window open. He pulled up the sash and then he and Millicent clambered inside, looking carefully around. He took a step forward, and broken glass crunched under his shoe.<br/><br/>"Nobody move," said a voice from the darkness. It was a woman's voice, with a rather tony English accent. "We have you covered."<br/><br/>"Not moving," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>A figure dressed in a black leotard with a balaclava pulled over her face stepped into the dim light of the window and tossed a pair of handcuffs at Jimmy. He could dimly see the other figure holding something that glinted very much like the blued steel of a pistol in the shadows.<br/><br/>Jimmy gave Millicent the nod he always had given Francis before he went into action and plowed forward at the woman who'd tossed him the handcuffs. He knocked her to the ground but she rolled over and popped up quite lithely. Millicent ran for the deeper shadows further into the room. There was a flash and the muffled report of a silenced handgun as the other woman fired her pistol.<br/><br/>Across the street, Dr. Orange had seen Jimmy throw up his hands earlier. "Why are they always waiting for us?" he muttered. When he saw the flash of the pistol, he didn't think twice--he fired his rifle at where he expected the shooter to be.<br/><br/>Inside the office glass shattered as the high-velocity rifle bullet smashed through it and buried itself into the floor at the feet of the woman with the gun. Millicent jumped on top of her from the shadows but couldn't knock her to the ground. She was cracked across the jaw by the barrel of the other woman's gun.<br/><br/>Jimmy tried to grab his opponent but she nimbly jumped up onto the desk. <i>She knows what she's doing</i>, he thought. <i>But so do I.</i><br/><br/>The woman with the gun swept her leg in a quick kick and threw Millicent to the ground. She jabbed the gun into Millicent's neck. "Mr. Wright, I really don't want to have to hurt anyone. Perhaps we could start over, eh?"<br/><br/>Millicent got a far-away look in her eyes. "You really don't want to use that gun. You really don't want to use that gun," she said in a level monotone.<br/><br/><i>[Intimidate spend by MP.]</i><br/><br/>"Mr. Wright, I really don't want to shoot this little girl," said the woman with the gun. "Let's all move to the center of the room and I'll put down my gun."<br/><br/>"I don't know you," said Jimmy. "Put your gun down first and then we'll talk."<br/><br/>The woman backed away from Millicent, keeping the gun trained on her the whole time, and backed towards Jimmy. Finally she stopped in front of him, knelt down quickly, and dropped the gun at her feet.<br/><br/>Millicent turned on the lights, so that Dr. Orange would have a better shot if he needed to take one.<br/><br/>"I think we owe these people flowers," said Millicent. "They're always breaking into our hotel rooms."<br/><br/>"I think they're with Epsilon Sigma," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Same difference."<br/><br/>"We can neither confirm nor deny any of our activities," said the Englishwoman.<br/><br/>"Did you like the book?" the woman on the desk whispered at Millicent. She nodded.<br/><br/>"We're here to recover any items of interest," said the Englishwoman.<br/><br/>"I'm here to recover items of interest. My items," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"We seem to be at a bit of an impasse."<br/><br/>"We could call the Feds and report a break-in," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Who are you?" demanded Jimmy.<br/><br/>"I really don't think that's important," said the Englishwoman.<br/><br/>"It is. Depending on who you are, I might just let you walk away with the stuff."<br/><br/>"I'm not at liberty to give out my name."<br/><br/>"You're asking us to trust you with sensitive items and you won't trust us with your name?" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Er...no, we were just going to take them. Unfortunately we both chose the same night. To be honest, I really don't care about your articles, but orders are orders."<br/><br/>"You're not with the sorority?" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"We take our orders from...higher up."<br/><br/>Jimmy narrowed his eyes. The woman was a pro, he knew--superb tradecraft. But he had a man with a rifle across the street. "Do your superiors prefer you alive or dead? I'd prefer the former."<br/><br/>"I agree. Why don't we just walk out of the office."<br/><br/>Jimmy nodded.<br/><br/>"All right, Mr. Wright. I'm sorry we couldn't meet under better circumstances." The two women in black backed out of the room, and then ran into the office.<br/><br/>Jimmy fiddled with a piece of wood at the baseboard, prying it up with his knife, and then using another key from his ring to activate the hydraulics that would raise his real safe back into position. While he was fiddling with the controls, Millicent saw something flash in a corner of the room. She walked over and fished out the necklace with the brass pendant from the broken glass and trash. <i>Uncle Jack's necklace</i>, she thought. She put it on.<br/><br/><i>[Me: Bwu-ha-ha-ha. I mean, good. (Millicent saw it because of her In The Blood Drive.)]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy went through his inventory. <i>One lightning gun, charges unknown. Several old books. That notebook Noor was always writing in. My "magic" armor. That box of various stuff...that's everything except Jack's necklace...</i><br/><br/>He turned around and saw that Millicent was wearing it. "How about we wait until a little later when we know what that thing does," he said, reaching out a hand to lift it off her neck.<br/><br/>Millicent grabbed it and stepped back. "I'm not going to do anything with it," she said petulantly. "I'm just <i>wearing</i> it."<br/><br/>"Why don't you keep it in your pocket?"<br/><br/><i>[Me: I'll give you two points of Stability to keep wearing it...]</i><br/><br/>"It's the only thing my, my father gave me!"<br/><br/>"I'm not asking you to get rid of it, I'm asking you to keep it and not use it. We understand each other, right? I...I know who you are. Who you <i>really</i> are. I know you read Jack's letter...and you know that we hid you away, so that even I couldn't know your new name. You saw all that when we had that...experience. I know you feel the connection to the world that isn't our reality. I'm just asking that you keep it in your pocket until we understand what it does."<br/><br/>"But I want to wear it."<br/><br/>"Please."<br/><br/>"Oh, all right." Millicent took it off, but wrapped it around her arm like a bracelet when Jimmy turned away with a sigh of relief.<br/><br/>As they were getting ready to leave, the phone rang. Jimmy gulped and picked up the receiver.<br/><br/>"Tell Betty to take the alternate route. Trust me on this; you told me about it personally. We'll probably talk soon...old friend."<br/><br/>Jimmy hung up. On the way out, he gave Betty the high sign, and she threw her car into reverse and spun around in a bootlegger's turn. Right as she did, another car came swooping out of a side street, barely missing her. Apparently the Englishwoman's friends were planning to hijack her. Fortunately, with her head start she was easily able to evade them.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448907/#Comment_448907" name="Item_128" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-07T04:22:52+00:00" title="October  7, 2015  4:22AM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, I keep forgetting Millicent has that necklace.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448912/#Comment_448912" name="Item_129" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-07T13:49:07+00:00" title="October  7, 2015  1:49PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think one of its powers is to cause people to forget about it <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448914/#Comment_448914" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-07T15:38:15+00:00" title="October  7, 2015  3:38PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode VIII: No Maze to Unwind (Part 12)</b><br/><br/>The offices of LASAS were located on the site of an old Spanish hacienda. "There's a nice deep wine cellar we can use for temporary storage," Ruby explained, as she led Jimmy through the offices. "Sorry there's no place to sit, the furniture is still on its way. So hard to get real teak tables nowadays."<br/><br/>"Not if you pay enough, apparently," said Jimmy, wincing at the thought of how much everything had cost. "What about permanent storage?"<br/><br/>"Found an excellent place out in Nevada, far away from here...or any earthquake faults. There's absolutely nothing around for miles, just rocks, desert, and salt flats. We have an old silver mine that we can use to stash things in, near a place called Groom Lake."<br/><br/>"Good. Nothing should ever happen out that way."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Eventually Millicent was able to eventually lift Noor's notebook off of Jimmy. Perhaps he didn\u2019t make it very hard, having resigned himself to her curiosity. It was a small, completely ordinary hard-bound notebook of the type archaeologists used. It was also heavily splattered with a dried red-brown substance. Many of the pages were stuck together.<br/><br/>"Noor al-Buraki," she read, "formerly a graduate student of Dr. Ali Kafour of the Cairo Museum; currently an investigator into the ancient mysteries. Notes to our researches, including a concordance of several tomes and excerpts from a translation-in-progress of the Al-Azif."<br/><br/>The book contained lots of details on various entities, almost in the manner of a general researching the weaknesses and strengths of his opponents. Sometimes she found penciled notes in another hand, mocking Noor's surmises or demanding more research. She also found snatches of various texts copied out in both the original (generally Arabic or archaic French) and English translations in a graceful hand on the facing page.<br/><br/>About the Liar she found some different opinions. Some described it as a minor nuisance, or at least as minor a nuisance as an extradimensional malevolent entity could be. Others said that it had come to Earth long ago, and had been screwing things up ever since.<br/><br/>The main markers of the Liar were the lack of a head--its avatars were nearly always headless--and mouths on the palms of hands. It was known to be able to possess people, especially people who went to deep into the research of the Liar. There was also a tradition that he was a god of the dead, or that "the dead belong to him." It seemed to be able to take the form of people who had died under its influence. It was also rumored to be a sexually transmitted disease of some kind. Millicent also found a note with a date that made it one of the last entries in the notebook: "12 August 1925: Poss. av. Nyarl."<br/><br/>A lot of the rituals to the Liar were similar to those of Gol-Goroth, making the Fisher a good cover for the Liar--both like orgiastic rituals. However, after the experience in the Yucat\xe1n, Millicent suspected they had different aims, because the Liar shared one important characteristic with Nyarlathotep: it was one of the gods that <i>talked</i>. For whatever reason, it comprehended humans in a way most of the other entities didn't, or couldn't.<br/><br/>Unanswered questions abounded: why did Echevarr\xeda summon the Liar? What does the contagion of Gol-Goroth mean? Why couldn't the Messenger see Millicent?<br/><br/>"You three," she thought. "That's what he said. Not <i>you four</i>. And Trammel couldn't see me that well...and he thinks the Liar is Nyarlathotep."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Ruby went to Millicent one day. "I have to tell you something I remembered after we left Mexico City. When we were in that pit that Leticia threw us into...when you and I fainted the second time...well, afterwards, I got some Nectar in my mouth and you know what happened to me. But I remember: so did you. And you weren't affected at all."<br/><br/>"I did? I hadn't realized...of course if you're right, I guess I wouldn't have." Millicent sighed. "I think that sorority is looking for me. I don't want to have delusions of grandeur, but I think they started the whole thing to look for me."<br/><br/>"Jimmy!" called Ruby.<br/><br/>He reluctantly slunk into the conference room at LASAS headquarters Ruby was using for her "Millicent Intervention."<br/><br/>"Jimmy," repeated Ruby, "what don't we know?"<br/><br/>"There's somebody who has my face and is buried in a grave!" blurted Millicent.<br/><br/>"I don't know all the details," sighed Jimmy. "I only know part of the details."<br/><br/>"I think they gave me some dead girl's face, to be on the safe side," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"It was mostly K's plan."<br/><br/>"Am I going to keep doing strange things?"<br/><br/>Jimmy paused, remembering a little girl who had walked through the side of a freighter in a flash of light. "You are extremely special and particularly gifted...at getting into trouble. And at understanding things. An innate understanding."<br/><br/>"That's bad, isn't it?"<br/><br/>"Probably. There is one...person...you must never meet."<br/><br/>"The one who couldn't see me?"<br/><br/>"Yes. If he ever does, bad things will happen."<br/><br/>"What kind of bad things?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"World problems, let's say."<br/><br/>"Like boiling oceans? Apocalypse?"<br/><br/>"If I get my brain scrambled again, will that stop it?" asked Millicent.<br/><br/>"It might delay it."<br/><br/>"Does this have to do with the thing in her neck?" asked Ruby.<br/><br/>"It's part of the countering...I think. I only had a small part to play. We all did. We all did a small thing and nobody knew the whole plan, so that we could never betray it. And...it's why Francis, my best friend, hasn't talked to me in ten years.

But she didn't know what was done, just who you were.

As a bell mournfully tolled, Geronimo Cuevas slid into a confessional and began to recite his sins.<br/><br/>"Stop, my son," said the priest from behind the grillwork. "My son, you've been with us for a couple of weeks. No one works harder; you keep a vow of silence even though our order doesn't. But I feel you have not completely confessed everything that troubles you."<br/><br/>"There is a great darkness that haunts me."<br/><br/>"Yes, I can sense that. I am not sure that you have the right temperament for a communal life. I want you to think on that. I'll absolve you of your sins today...and we shall see what happens."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Ruby got a telephone call. "Ruby, this is Howard."<br/><br/>"Howard <i>Hughes</i>? Good to hear you again."<br/><br/>"Would you mind having lunch with me out at the yacht club tomorrow?"<br/><br/>"My pleasure."<br/><br/>The next day she motored out to Malibu. Howard graciously took her down to a small but elegantly set table on a pavilion near the water. As she drank her iced tea, a two-engined flying boat swooped out of the sky and landed in the water. It ran into shore and then rode up the boat slip on its own wheeled landing gear.<br/><br/>The plane was remarkably beautiful, with sleek lines and a parasol wing. The engines were mounted over the wing. On the rear of the fuselage there were two blisters, enormous clear plexiglass bubbles.<br/><br/>"Little project the government wanted me to look at," said Hughes. "Consolidated is building it. War Department wanted me to review it as a bomber and observation plane."<br/><br/>"What a fantastic machine," thrilled Ruby.<br/><br/>"I want you to have it."<br/><br/>"What? Why?"<br/><br/>"Let me be honest with you. I'm probably the person who's flown fastest, highest, and furthest of anyone in the world.  There are things up there, Ruby. I've seen them. I hear from the grapevine that you've seen things like that too. And you're working with Jimmy Wright..."<br/><br/>"I've seen things that most would not bring up in public. Or in private. Or with anyone, actually."<br/><br/>"I think this might be pretty useful to you. I've rigged out the interior like a flying yacht, for your comfort."<br/><br/>"What can I do for you?"<br/><br/>"Just knowing that you're using it right is my reward. Shall we have lunch? Hope you like lobster."<br/><br/><i>[The plane is in fact a prototype of the Catalina, which was used in anti-sub reconnaissance during WWII. After the war, a few were rigged out as literal flying yachts!]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Jimmy was holed up in one of his safe houses in Marina del Rey when there was a knock on his door. There was a man outside in a bad suit, with that certain tough-guy look only former cops have. "Mr. Wright? My name's Lou Columbo. I sorta work for you. Can we talk?"<br/><br/>They sat in the living room. "I know the Feds shut down your office," said Columbo. "I'd like to remind you that you have a <i>second</i> office and they haven't shut us down yet. Sure, a lot of guys left after all the receptionists vanished, and your unexpected trips out of the country...but we've brought our wives in to work the phones and we're still solving cases. I just wanted you to know that Special Branch is still out there and working for you."<br/><br/>"Just don't get yourselves killed."<br/><br/>"Yeah. Thanks Mr. Wright. Gotta go back and take care of my sister's kid Frank, he's visiting from Brooklyn." \n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>"Brother Cuevas? you have visitors."<br/><br/>"Really, brother?" said Geronimo, sitting up on his pallet. "Who are they?"<br/><br/>"An American and his servant."<br/><br/>Geronimo went out to the courtyard of the abbey where much to his surprise he saw Captain Murphy, Charlie--and a little girl, maybe five or six years old.<br/><br/>"Jerry!" said Murphy, jabbing out his hand to shake with Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Where is Ruby?" said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Ruby gave me the oddest letter. It's led me some strange places, including to the orphanage in town where I picked up this little one. The Sisters tell me she speaks good English."<br/><br/>"What reason would you have to pick up this girl?"<br/><br/>"She's my daughter. Ruby's letter opened my eyes to a lot of things. The thing about me and Ruby is that she's a great gal, but we're just too alike. She needs someone who can provide stability and take care of her."<br/><br/>"That's what she hired me for."<br/><br/>"Well, if it doesn't hurt too much to point out--you kind of quit. I think you should go back to L.A."<br/><br/>"I didn't think she needed me."<br/><br/>"I think she needs you more than she needs me." Captain Murphy was holding a small journal in his left hand, clutching it very tightly.<br/><br/>"What do you plan to do with your daughter?"<br/><br/>"Find a good school for her, and then try and raise her. Raise her right! Teach her the things she needs to know, like a sheepshank! And which fork to use!"<br/><br/>"I'm not sure a ship with a bunch of sailors is the best place..."<br/><br/>"No, we'll have to settle down. Maybe Groton, or Boston...someplace like that."<br/><br/>"I'm not sure settling down is the best course for you."<br/><br/>"True. Maybe we'll keep on the move. We'll go to London! Paris! Zurich! Maybe give Berlin a miss."<br/><br/>"I'm not sure it's the most stable lifestyle for a child...especially without her mother."<br/><br/>"I don't think Ruby's going to settle down anytime soon...so it's my job. Anyway, I'm giving you Charlie to take you back to L.A."<br/><br/>"The white devil speaks true," said Charlie, with a grin. "I will accompany you to Los Angeles, if you wish."<br/><br/>"Why should I go to Los Angeles?" said Geronimo. "I'm comfortable here."<br/><br/>"No offense, Jerry, but  whatever's bothering you, you won't work it out among a bunch of cassocked priests," said Murphy. "Mumbo jumbo and waving their hands over you, that's not going to fix anything! You need to go out and do God's work."<br/><br/>"What is God's work?" said Geronimo bitterly.<br/><br/>"Well, it's up to you, Jerry. You want to stay and wither away here in Mexico, go ahead--it's a good country to do it in."<br/><br/>"Hey!" said a couple of Mexican priests walking by.<br/><br/>"My stay here has run its course," said Geronimo. "I will travel to Los Angeles. Let me get my things."<br/><br/>Geronimo returned to his cell, picked up his razor, his picture of his brother--and his gun. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449015/#Comment_449015" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-13T17:34:30+00:00" title="October 13, 2015  5:34PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode IX: Blue Monk (Part 2)</b><br/><br/>"I think you are doing the right thing," said Charlie to Geronimo one night when they were standing on the deck of the cargo ship that had taken them on as extra hands. "Miss Ruby must be going through a difficult time, for I saw her step out of the dream world. And that is not a good thing to do."<br/><br/>"Dream world?"<br/><br/>"\u2026May I say, Mr. Cuevas, I have known you and the Captain and Miss Ruby for a long time. When the Captain found me, I was much like you--I had great shame I needed to atone. That is why I was trying to commit ritual suicide. The Captain found me and stopped me. For a long time, I was very angry at the white devil for that. When I met Miss Ruby, I thought, 'Well, the Captain and she deserve each other--perhaps one day they will kill each other and resolve all our problems.' But then through her I met you. And there came a day when I realized that Captain Murphy did not deserve Miss Ruby. And I realized that was because if <i>you</i> would follow Miss Ruby, then she must have something more than just what Captain Murphy saw in her."<br/><br/>"I am glad to hear you think so highly of me. I am not so sure I see that much more in Ruby. She is who she is."<br/><br/>"She came out of the dream world. That will change a person."<br/><br/>"Then perhaps she is a stranger now."<br/><br/>"Perhaps." Charlie turned back to his French copy of Rousseau. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Millicent did some research on the vandalism at Evergreen Cemetery. She paid a visit to the caretaker who had been hurt during the incident.<br/><br/>"I don't know what to tell you," he said. "Somebody cold-cocked me from behind. Messed me up pretty good, even took a bite out of me! Probably one of those drugged up Mexican gangs, I hear they been biting people lately."<br/><br/>"What were they doing?<br/><br/>"Dug up a grave. Some little girl, Leticia Adams."<br/><br/>"Can I see it?"<br/><br/>"Sure."<br/><br/>When she saw the grave, which hadn't been filled in, Millicent couldn't shake the feeling that there was at least a possibility that the grave had been dug out <i>from inside</i>. "Shame they dug up some poor girl's grave," she said.<br/><br/>"Yeah, everything's going to hell," said the caretaker. "The damn Roosevelt's in office, the mayor's a crook. What are you going to do?"<br/><br/>"Did they take the body?"<br/><br/>"No idea, we haven't exhumed the coffin. I figured they were disturbing the earth, maybe trying to dig up the tombstone. Kids today."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Dr. Orange was reading a copy of the Los Angeles <i>Daily Mirror</i>. "Jimmy Wright: Phony Tribune of the People!" screamed the headline.<br/><br/>"Dr. Orange," said Geronimo from the entrance of his office.<br/><br/>"Ja?" said the doctor, not looking up. "Wait, where the hell have you been?"<br/><br/>"Taking care of my needs. I was hoping that you could help me find Ruby."<br/><br/>"She's got some charity, the Los Angeles Society of Archaeological Studies. Look it up in the phone book. Unless you have something important."<br/><br/>Dr. Born ran into the office, erased one character from the chalkboard that was covered with  equations, and wrote in a Greek letter.<br/><br/>"That changes everything!" said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>Dr. Born walked out, followed by Geronimo. He had just reached the lobby when Dr. Orange caught up with him. "Wait, maybe you can get Ruby to fund us," he said, shrugging into his coat.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"Mr. Cuevas," said Millicent from behind the receptionist's desk at LASAS. "You're back!"<br/><br/>"I have returned, yes. I want to see Miss Ruby."<br/><br/>"Did you come back the normal way?"<br/><br/>Geronimo started to say something and paused. "Let me just buzz you in," said Millicent quickly.<br/><br/>"Ruby!" said Dr. Orange, rushing into the office. "Can you look over my grant proposal? Also Jerry's back."<br/><br/>"I see," said Ruby. "Millicent, can you take care of that?"<br/><br/>"Can you explain your proposal?" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"That's what undergraduates are for!"<br/><br/>"Maybe you could put it in terms that director we worked with would understand?"<br/><br/>"Oh, all right. It uses bad magic."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Ruby led Geronimo into her office. She gave him an affectionate, tender hug, taking the Spaniard by surprise. <br/><br/>"Perhaps you have changed," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Who said I changed?"<br/><br/>"Captain Murphy and Charlie. They found me in the abbey. I also had the pleasure of meeting your daughter."<br/><br/>Ruby just stared.<br/><br/><i>[And that's you shut up! I said. 1 point Stability loss to Ruby.]</i><br/><br/>"I think the Captain means well but I am not sure that is the best environment for a child," said Geronimo. "Ruby, how long have I known you? More than two years. I know I have only been your employee but I thought perhaps I knew you better."<br/><br/>"I was younger. I got caught up in an idiotic situation...I put her up for adoption because I thought anyone would make a better mother. I didn't know how to be responsible then...and maybe in that way I've changed."<br/><br/>"What does this place you have founded do?"<br/><br/>"It will protect people from the kinds of things we've seen...things people might not even believe in but can harm them."<br/><br/>"Does this mean there's no room for me in your life?"<br/><br/>"Of course not. I need my friend, my companion...I know you're hurt as well. I want to make you feel better as well."<br/><br/>"Don't you think your daughter would be better off with you?"<br/><br/>"Mixed up with all this?"<br/><br/>Geronimo paused. "I do see a difference in you. But where do I fit in your life?"<br/><br/>"Stay with me. Be my companion," said Ruby, holding his arm. "And if you need any help with anything..."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"Charlie!" said Ruby, coming out of her office. "I didn't know you did crossword puzzles."<br/><br/>"For a long time I thought they were a spell used by the white devil to imprison me. Now I realize they are a passtime. Captain Murphy lied very often."<br/><br/>"What's your real name, by the way?"<br/><br/>"Ra\u2019iarii."<br/><br/>"I'll just call you Charlie, then."<br/><br/>"Most people do."<br/><br/>"Would you like to join our organization, or do you want to go back to working for Murphy?"<br/><br/>"I do not wish to work for the Captain, nor am I able to return to my home. And if you are truly now a creature of the dreamtime, I think you will need my help."<br/><br/>"So this is going to happen again?" said Millicent, miserably.<br/><br/>"It has all happened before, so it will all probably happen again."<br/><br/>"What has happened?" said Geronimo, puzzled.<br/><br/>"While you were away..." began Ruby. She glanced around. "We shared an experience. Call it a reconception. You're nothing, and then you're born, and...then you grow up...so....it's like a birth...well, we spoke with more than one of these...elder...beings..."<br/><br/>"Your sins have been forgiven. You have been reborn. <i>Deo gratia,</i>" said Geronimo.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449029/#Comment_449029" name="Item_134" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-14T16:30:36+00:00" title="October 14, 2015  4:30PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 14, 2015 4:40PM by Aviatrix.">edited October 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode IX: Blue Monk (Part 3)</b><br/><br/>"I spoke to the caretaker at that cemetery that got vandalized," Millicent said to Jimmy.<br/><br/>Jimmy twitched. "Why..."<br/><br/>"Do you remember when we put that part of an arm in the icebox?"<br/><br/>"I try not to think about it."<br/><br/>"Well I took it out to look at it and it told me a plot to go see and that was the plot that got vandalized and it was some six year old's grave and the picture of her was the picture that Vanessa took of me but it's not the same as the one Uncle Jack took of me..."<br/><br/>"An arm, that was separated from its body and was still moving gave you an address <i>and you followed it!</i>"<br/><br/>"It was only on the way to my dinner with Dr. Fauche!"<br/><br/>"We still have to talk about that!"<br/><br/>"And the caretaker said he got attacked and the ground was all dug up and I don't know if it was from above or below..."<br/><br/>"There's a multi-layered plan to keep you safe," said Jimmy. "Unfortunately, when our security measures start to get untangled they bite us in the ass. Don't go back there to snoop."<br/><br/>"Snoop on what?"<br/><br/>"You always find something to snoop on! Just leave it alone, it will be fine. Because if we start investigating, it might cause people to notice."<br/><br/>"And the other thing we talked to couldn't see me, the Mess--"<br/><br/>"And we're going to stop talking about that too  Is there anything else?"<br/><br/>"Mr. Cuevas is back!"<br/><br/>"Great." Jimmy paused. "This is going to be weird..."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Bangkok! The heart of the Kingdom of Siam, a crossroads for Southeast Asia. Bangkok! The steaming riverbanks, the narrow canals threaded between densely packed blocks of houses. Bangkok! City of thousands of shrines, millions of people, and a smile on all of them! Everywhere they looked they saw something new, something exotic to them, something they didn't understand.<br/><br/><i>[I charged everyone a point of Stability for general culture shock--thanks to Bill White for that idea--and then we had the </i>de rigeur<i> playing of "One Night in Bangkok."]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy nervously pawed through his flash cards. "Uh...sawatdee...khrup?" he said to Millicent.<br/><br/>"Very good, Mr. Wright! Let's review the numbers," she said. They had been trying to pick up some Thai during the preparations for the trip, a task the multilingual Millicent found far easier than Jimmy, who had never bothered to learn another language. <br/>They had arrived during the wet season. Rain poured down on them, steaming off the roofs of the buildings near the wharves. The air, muggy and warm, was stifling.<br/><br/>"What's our first task?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Bangkok hasn't really gotten up on the whole house numbers concept," said Millicent. "So we need to find that address."<br/><br/>"Do we know anyone here?" said Ruby. "I know rich people, and Jimmy you know scoundrels."<br/><br/>"Lot of overlap there," said Jimmy. "I think I know someone...I heard she moved here from Shanghai..."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>They went down to the red light district, which was conveniently nearby. "This is the place," said Jimmy, pointing to a small bar with the world "Lily's" written in English over it, along with longer signs in Siamese and Chinese.<br/><br/>"Wait..." said Ruby. "I think I know what some of those characters mean..."<br/><br/>Jimmy shrugged and led them into the bar. It was dimly lit, with movie posters tacked up along all the walls. Several heavily made up people were lounging at little cabaret tables scattered around the place, some talking to Siamese businessmen who were nursing their drinks. Behind the bar, a middle-aged drag queen with immaculately applied makeup looked up as they entered.<br/><br/>"Hello, Lily," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Wait a minute..." said Lily. "I know you...you were looking for Jack back in Shanghai. Jimmy, wasn't it?"<br/><br/>"How are you?"<br/><br/>"I'm older."<br/><br/>"You don't look it."<br/><br/><i>[Me: So you're using Flattery...]</i><br/><br/>"I want to be clear, you're not the first white man to chase me down, even after ten years. What can I do you for?"<br/><br/>"These are my colleagues."<br/><br/>"Well," said Lilly, giving Geronimo a once-over. She glanced at Ruby. "Oh honey, that's so last year."<br/><br/>Ruby glared back.<br/><br/>"...and my goodness, this is a total tear-down," continued Lily, shaking her head at Millicent. "I see you need our services."<br/><br/>"I get that a lot," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"But you did bring such a handsome friend," said Lilly, smiling at Geronimo.<br/><br/>"I...do not...I'm not...quite...sure...if I'm the...right..." muttered Geronimo nervously.<br/><br/>"She helped me out with a case once," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Anyway," continued Lily, "A, thanks a lot for bringing in so many white people, it helps with the advertising. B, why are you in Siam (I hope there's a wedding ring involved)..."<br/><br/>"Sorry, Lily."<br/><br/>"Always a bridesmaid..."<br/><br/>"Actually, we're looking for an address."<br/><br/>"I'm just a social director, eh?

The building itself proved to be a townhouse.<br/><br/>Jimmy waited until the first street kid tried to pick his pocket, and then nabbed him to get information about the house. Squirming under his grip, the boy said, "Yeah, there's a white guy lives in there. We call him Waen."<br/><br/>"Waen?"<br/><br/>"It means 'glasses'," said the kid, making circles around his eyes with his fingers. "He wears these big spectacles all the time. American, I think. Talks like you do."<br/><br/>The kid explained that Waen didn't seem to do much, just spend most of his time in the house, although he did make fairly regular trips out into the neighborhood. Jimmy gave the kid a few baht to pay for his tourist greeting services and then they set down to watch the house.<br/><br/>A few hours passed, and then Geronimo, watching from a silk seller's stall, saw two men dressed like stevedores go down the alley behind Waen's house. He followed them to the entrance of the alley, and saw them pound on the back door of the house for a while, calling out "Waen! Waen!" After a while they gave up and left the area. Ruby trailed them down to the river, where she saw them meet a crowd of dock workers and have a heated conversation in Siamese with them.<br/><br/><i>[Shadowing test by RP.]</i><br/><br/>Geronimo, Jimmy, Millicent, and Dr. Orange made plans to break into the house, since "Waen" wasn't home. While Millicent watched the alley to make sure nobody interrupted them, Jimmy easily picked the lock on the back door and the rest of them slipped in.<br/><br/>The house was sparsely decorated with modern furniture, but they noticed a few unusual things. There didn't seem to be anything <i>personal</i> anywhere--no pictures of family, nothing that looked like a keepsake, no personal letters. The clothes in the closet were all conservative American-style summer outfits.<br/><br/>Under the bed Jimmy turned up a small wooden box with several dozen vials of nectar inside. There were two styles of vials; one was stamped with something in Siamese. Next to the box was a record album from Luz Records in Mexico City.<br/><br/>In the closet they found a basket full of bundles of baht, several thousand dollars in U. S. currency.<br/><br/>Jimmy found a handkerchief with the monogram "DL" on it, the only thing that gave even a hint of Waen's identity.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>They set up a rotating watch on Waen's house, and in the evening they saw a man in a suit very much like the ones they had seen in the house bound up the steps to the townhouse. He was wearing a fashionable pair of horn-rimmed glasses. He unlocked the door and let himself in. After a while a light came on inside, and they heard the sound of classical music playing on a gramophone.<br/><br/>"Ruby, go charm the man," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Someone needs to come with me," pleaded Ruby. "You said he has Nectar!"<br/><br/>"I will go," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>They walked up to the house and knocked on the door. It opened to reveal the man they had seen come in. "Can I help you?" he said in a pleasant, Middle-American accent.<br/><br/>"We've heard this is a place to have some fun," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Don't know who would have said that, this is just my house."<br/><br/>"Some of the dockworkers mentioned something fun and exciting, and we thought we'd give it a shot."<br/><br/>The man paused for a moment. "Sure, come on in," he said, ushering them inside.<br/><br/>They stepped into the living room. "So...this is for both of you?" said Waen, dubiously.<br/><br/>"Yes, we'd like to try and experiment...hands up!" said Ruby, pulling her small automatic out of her handbag.<br/><br/>"Now, hold on a moment..." began the man, quickly raising his arms. "I don't have a lot of money..."<br/><br/>"We're not interested in your money. We not interested in what you're selling. We're interested in where it's coming from and who's supplying it!"<br/><br/>"I thought you wanted to go to the fights!"<br/><br/>"We're not interested in them. We want the name of your supplier, and where they're getting it from. The Nectar!"<br/><br/>"...you must be one of Samson's little fellas. May I put my hands down or are you going to shoot--"<br/><br/>"Keep 'em up!"<br/><br/>"I manage the fight business around here, and the Nectar is used for in them. That's all I know! I made myself useful to the organization."<br/><br/>"What organization!"<br/><br/>Waen hesitated. Geronimo loomed behind her menacingly. "I can tell you where the fights are held," squeaked Waen. "Is that enough? Frankly, if you go higher up than that there will be consequences. The fights are all held at the Noble Pali Monastery."<br/><br/><i>[Intimidation spend by GP; I asked for an interpersonal spend, because Waen is pretty cool beneath his meek demeanor.]</i><br/><br/>"Who's supplying it?"<br/><br/>"That's all I know."<br/><br/>Ruby fished out several hundred American dollars from her bag. "We never came here, you never spoke with you, all right?"<br/><br/><i>[Bargain spend by RP.]</i><br/><br/>"You're not really from Samson, are you?" said Waen.<br/><br/>"We dealt with him."<br/><br/>"And what is your intention here?"<br/><br/>"We enjoyed Samson's product, but we can't get it in Los Angeles anymore. So we're coming here to get some."<br/><br/>"You know it's different here in Siam?"<br/><br/>"Honey, Nectar's Nectar. And I'm jonesing."<br/><br/>"Well if that's all, I could just get you in the fights, I'm sure you'd enjoy it..."<br/><br/>"Thanks, but I prefer my Nectar in a safe environment."<br/><br/>"There's very few safe places in Bangkok. Maybe I could see clear to sell you some <i>Maltese</i> Nectar."<br/><br/><i>[Stability Test time for Ruby, TN 5!</i><br/><br/><i>JP: Spend 4 or nothing.</i><br/><i>RP: I'll spend...3.</i><br/><i>Me: An 83% chance isn't so bad...</i><br/><i>RP: Never tell me the odds!</i><br/><br/><i>But Ruby passed.]</i><br/><br/>"No thanks," said Ruby through gritted teeth.<br/><br/>"And what are you here for?" Waen asked Geronimo, putting his hands down as he did.<br/><br/>"Just to make sure you answer questions," Geronimo replied smoothly.<br/><br/>"And what exactly was the question? In all this confusion, I seem to have lost the thread of our conversation."<br/><br/><i>[JP: Oh, this has gone from they're in control to he's in control...</i><br/><br/><i>(It's always nice to know your "project an air of silent menace" is working.)</i><br/><br/><i>JP: No shots have been fired...</i><br/><i>GP: Not yet.]</i><br/><br/>"You won't tell anyone we came," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Oh, I promise. I won't tell anyone," said Waen. "And when you get to the monastery, just tell them you've come to celebrate the rites of old. They'll take good care of you."<br/><br/><i>[Bargain Spend by RP.]</i><br/><br/>Ruby and Geronimo backed out of the house, and then started walking rapidly away, careful not to even glance at Millicent, Jimmy, and Dr. Orange. They walked for a half an hour but were confident they had thrown their tail.<br/><br/><i>[Sense Trouble by RP, and it worked--they did throw their tail.

Millicent decided to head out to watch Waen's house--or Daniel Lowman, as her research on him had finally turned up.<br/><br/>The monastery was a long, low building, mostly walls surrounding a large open courtyard. Towers piled high in the traditional Indian fashion rose from the corners of the inner court.<br/><br/>Once they got past the guards at the gate, they began to notice odd things. The inscriptions and hangings inside the temple were a strange and eclectic mix of Theraveda Buddhism, Zen, and traditional Hinduism.<br/><br/>In the center of the courtyard was a large Zen garden, which was extremely out of place, as were the monks who wore blue robes instead of the normal saffron or orange of Thai buddhists. The blue robed monks were practicing some kind of martial art that looked a bit like Tai Chi.<br/><br/><i>[Theology use by Doc Orange to pick up on the oddness of the monastery's decoration.]</i><br/><br/>Eventually, one of the blue robed monks came up to meet them. "Welcome," he said.<br/><br/>"We're Canadians," said Ruby. "We like seeing the local architecture, culture..."<br/><br/>"This is a place of worship, however."<br/><br/>"Yes, but we are seekers of knowledge."<br/><br/>"As was Buddha. What are you interested in learning."<br/><br/>"I am a practitioner of karate. I would like to study your fighting style."<br/><br/>"You understand for us there is no difference between the practice of Buddhism and the practice of martial arts? It requires purification and dedication."<br/><br/>"Can we speak with someone to learn more?"<br/><br/>"I'd like to learn too," said Dr. Orange. "I want to know how Tai Chi made its way down here."<br/><br/>"It's not exactly Tai Chi, nor is it exactly gongfu," said the monk. "Our abbot developed the style after many years of study and training. We also incorporate muy thai, of course."<br/><br/>"This should all be meditation, not fighting," muttered Dr. Orange under his breath. Out loud he said, "I'd like to meet the abbot."<br/><br/>"Well, you are unclean foreigners, if you'll excuse the expression. I don't speak English very well," said the monk.<br/><br/>"Oh, but we'd love any chance we could have to learn more," said Ruby winningly.<br/><br/><i>[Flattery spend by RP. I asked for an Interpersonal spend here, although listening to it now...well, I'm not sure meeting the abbot is a Core Clue, and this is certainly an easier way.]</i><br/><br/>"Very well, I will take you to him."<br/><br/>They followed the monk through a long colonnade and into a pleasant garden in a courtyard. "Abbot Udom will see you know," said the monk, gesturing them into the garden.<br/><br/>They pushed into the courtyard and suddenly all stopped still. Sitting cross-legged on the ground in front of them was a wiry middle-aged man, who carried with him that air of steely grace Jimmy had seen only in the greatest fighters. But that was not what made them freeze.<br/><br/>An enormous tiger was lying next to him, its head on his lap.<br/><br/>"You are my new Canadian disciples?" the man said in English. "I am Thawi Udom. It is somewhat unusual that people of your persuasion should find us. How did you discover this monastery?"<br/><br/>"We've been visiting several monasteries, actually," said Ruby. She rattled off the list of obscure monasteries she had paid a local guide to tell her about.<br/><br/><i>[Preparedness spend by RP to have this knowledge.]</i><br/><br/>"At the Noble Pali monastery we pursue a new line of Buddhist thought. For many years I served in various mercenary groups, including the Foreign Legion. I fought many small wars, but then I had a revelation: I should live in peace. So now I bring the discipline of the fighting arts, and the many different religions I took inspiration from."<br/><br/><i>[I based a bit of Udom's story on the biography of Morihei Uesheiba.]</i><br/><br/>"We have come to celebrate the rituals of old," said Jimmy. <br/><br/>"All three of you?"<br/><br/>"I have," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Come to the side gate this evening," said Udom, "and we will conduct you to the rites. We will accommodate those who wish to watch." <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/3Jane" title="3Jane"><img alt="3Jane" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/3Jane">3Jane</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449079/#Comment_449079" name="Item_138" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-20T10:46:04+00:00" title="October 20, 2015 10:46AM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, I just wanted to say I'm still reading with bated breath and wishing I could play or run games like yours.

The same basket, Millicent noticed, that they had found all the money in.<br/><br/>Millicent fell into her shadowing routine, following Lowman to a government office of some kind. He went inside for a short period and then returned--without the basket. She kept on his tail as he entered a seedier part of town.<br/><br/>Lowman stopped at a noodle stand to talk to a Thai man who was sitting there. Lowman talked to him for a while, his face always pleasant and open. But by the end of the conversation, the other man was shaking and seemed to be pleading for something. Lowman slapped him on his back and left the noodle stand. <br/><br/>After a while Lowman stopped at a cafe and met with several white people. Millicent crept up close to them so that she could make out what they said. They were having a low conversation in French.<br/><br/>"How could you lose them in the marketplace," Lowman was saying. "I thought I trained you better than that."<br/><br/>"We're sorry, sir, but they proved remarkably effective at slipping away."<br/><br/>"Make another mistake like that," said Lowman, "and I will report you to <i>your</i> supervisors. And I think we both know what will happen then."<br/><br/>"Yes sir. We've already found their hotel."<br/><br/>"Good. Watch them. I need to check in with Udom."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Betty gave Jimmy and company the news that their hotel had been burned. Again.<br/><br/>"Perhaps Lily could help us," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Sure," she said when they asked. "I have some people who owe me favors."<br/><br/>"Are they trustworthy?" asked Jimmy.<br/><br/>"No, but they're not going to rat on you to any organized crime people. Not after you pay the cover, at least."<br/><br/>"They'll probably rifle through our stuff," mused Ruby.<br/><br/>"We're used to that!" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Your stuff, maybe," said Lily to Ruby. "Her stuff, probably not. Sorry. And they'll probably want pictures of your bodyguard there."<br/><br/>"Fragrant Honey Shop," mused Jimmy. "We've heard that before."<br/><br/>"That bum!" said Ruby. "The one who broke into my house! He said to go there for the nectar...and you had to say something..."<br/><br/>"Let me check my notes," said Millicent. "It was, 'I have come for the exhibition.' That got you in to watch the fights. But...wait. This SS wrote Trammel that if you wanted to fight, you said 'I have come to join the circle of excess.'"<br/><br/>"Neither of those match what Lowman told us," said Jimmy. "I'm willing to bet that what he told us to say was something like 'Kill these interlopers.'"<br/><br/><i>[I walked a tightrope on this one--I didn't want to overrule the spend, so I made it clear that Lowman hadn't ratted the PCs out to the cult; but he did give them the code message meaning to not trust the speaker.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Millicent and Dr. Orange went out in search of the man Lowman had talked to at the noodle shop. Some asking around finally got them a name, Siripong, and a location, which was a dive bar.<br/><br/>"Great, more white people," he said when they sat next to him at the bar. "You going to ruin my day too?"<br/><br/>"We just want to find out how the other white guy ruined your day," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"I don't have any pretensions. I don't pretend to be a nice guy. Maybe you heard there's an underground fighting circuit? I was thinking, they got their thing in their territory, so I could start my own in mine. But Waen came by and he told me that if I didn't stop he'd send some guys over who knew how to torture. The words <i>castration</i> and <i>flaying</i> worked their way into the conversation. He's pretty creepy, he has a bunch of Europeans who work for him. He's mixed up with Thawi at the temple...but I think he works for someone else higher up.

"I can do your makeup."<br/><br/>"Oh bitch, it's <i>on</i>," said Lily.<br/><br/>"You can help me pick out an outfit!" said Millicent to her.<br/><br/>"Thank you, Buddha! About time."<br/><br/>Pretty soon they were all in costume. Jimmy was now wearing a beard, with hair graying at the temples, and an expat's immaculate white suit. Geronimo looked like a Basque sailor. Ruby was wearing a jet black wig and a decadent evening gown; she was made up to look older and uglier than she was. Dr. Orange was in a clean white jacket, the perfect valet to Ruby and Jimmy. And Millicent...Millicent...she looked like...<br/><br/>"A prostitute," said Lily. "Trust me, it's the best disguise, you can be Geronimo's pickup. Plus you look like Veronica Lake in this wig! If you squint.

The zen garden in the middle of the central courtyard had been cleared, with a wooden paling fence erected around it, and temporary risers rigged up on all sides.<br/><br/>The crowd was mostly Siamese, with some Chinese and even a few Japanese there; some of the latter two groups were in uniform. There were clumps of Europeans in some of the more elaborate boxes. Dr. Orange recognized a few of them as quite clearly German embassy staff--and by embassy staff, we mean spies, of course.<br/><br/><i>[Bureaucracy spend by OP, followed by a Cop Talk spend to let him recognize the actual spy.]</i><br/><br/>"That guy, I've heard about him in the underground--Hugo J\xfcrgens. A real Nazi for sure," he told the others, as the first fighters were led into the arena.<br/><br/><i>[Of course at this point OP started playing the Mortal Combat theme on his phone.]</i><br/><br/>Sixty-six seconds later, the fight was over--one of the combatants had pulled the arm out of a socket from his opponent, and then used the severed limb to beat the third fighter to death.<br/><br/>The next fight had a Roman theme--two teams of five armed with tridents and nets murdered each other in a gruesome free-for-all.<br/><br/><i>[Mostly a 2 point Stability loss; I knocked off a point for Geronimo (soldier) and Ruby (Adventure drive).]</i><br/><br/>Geronimo and Millicent, down with the groundlings, decided to try and sneak off into the rest of the monastery. Up in the boxes, Ruby and Jimmy tried to keep from throwing up; Dr. Orange dropped out to talk to the "other" servants.<br/><br/>"Wot terrible form," said a Cockney he met outside a box with a few Englishmen inside. "'Enry's me name."<br/><br/>"How often do you come to these things?" said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"Every other week or so. You get used to it--oh, look at that! Poor blighter, I liked 'im. There's a lay order 'ere, some of the foreign bigshots belong to; they don't fight or nothin', just get in the inner circle.

They found a room with little partitions set against the wall to form cells of a kind. They were floored with woven mats, and had sleeping blocks instead of beds. A few were occupied by blue robed monks in lotus position, deep in meditation.<br/><br/>Further down they began to hear the sound of low voices, interspersed with the sound of flesh being struck. Peeking around the corner they saw several people in blue robes sitting in meditation postures, being struck by other men--with fists, with clubs, with whips.<br/><br/>They scurried past that area and headed down another corridor. At the end was a room that was obviously Udom's office, and just as obviously not the office of a Buddhist monk; it was well-appointed, with teak furniture and silk wall hangings. There were pictures of Udom from his mercenary and French Foreign Legion days. In the desk they found letters and telegrams from SS, most referring to the testing of new formulas that were being sent to the monastery, or requesting a higher rate of "production" so that something could be used in tests. A man named Pramoj was referred to several times.<br/><br/>"Look at all these letters from embassies," said Millicent. She wrote down the countries that had corresponded with Udom.<br/><br/>"This is an invitation," said Geronimo, waving a piece of paper. "To some meeting on 'the island.' What could that mean?"<br/><br/>They left the office and followed the sketch map Millicent had made of the monastery based on the exterior layout. At one point they heard men coming up the corridor towards them and they ducked into a monk's cell. The men walked by carrying heavy buckets. "It's made so much tonight," one groaned. "Get Pramoj to clean up."<br/><br/><i>[GP and MP had a 3 point "General Stuff About the Monastery Pool" they used to find Udom's office, and Millicent's map was a 3-point Preparedness spend.]</i><br/><br/>A man in a ragged French Foreign Legion uniform came out in response to their calls. He was carrying a mop and wore a surgical mask over his face.<br/><br/>"He was in one of the pictures in Udom's office!" said Millicent. "Let's follow him."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>"Isn't that Lowman?" said Ruby. "Over there, with the Germans and Udom."<br/><br/>"Why is he hanging out with them?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"I don't know, but one of the Embassy guys just passed him a folder. Come on, Jimmy. I need to find the bathroom."<br/><br/>Taking Jimmy's arm, Ruby staggered over to the German box. Lowman intercepted them. "Pardon me, ma'am, but this is a private box."<br/><br/>Ruby gagged and pressed her hands over her mouth.<br/><br/>"Oh, I see," said Lowman quickly. "There's a bucket over by the stands. It's not quite dignified, but this sort of thing happens a lot here."<br/><br/>Meanwhile the very Prussian-looking man Dr. Orange had told them was named J\xfcrgens drew himself up with affronted, barely-controlled rage. "I am sorry, <i>edle Frau</i>, but this is not a box for civilians such as yourself."<br/><br/>"Hey, that's my wife!" said Jimmy, blocking J\xfcrgens' view. "She insisted we come, but she can't take it. Lay off her!" He took a step back, bumping into Lowman, who stumbled into Ruby, dropping his folder.<br/><br/>Ruby swept it up off the floor, slipping some papers out as she did. She passed it back to Lowman without a word, and then threw up.<br/><br/>"Verdamnte Amerikanerin!" shouted J\xfcrgens.<br/><br/><br/><i>[Me: I don't really need to know why Ruby can throw up at will, right?</i><br/><br/><i>It was a Filch roll by Ruby to get the papers, set up in the fiction by Jimmy's bump and grind with Lowman.]</i><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449153/#Comment_449153" name="Item_143" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-26T17:10:40+00:00" title="October 26, 2015  5:10PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode IX: Blue Monk (Part 8)</b><br/><br/>Geronimo and Millicent followed the man in the mask down the corridor. He disappeared through an open doorway into a larger room.<br/><br/>"Is he talking to someone in there?" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"He's talking, but I don't think to a person," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>From the room they heard the masked man ask, "But what is the difference between your production at different times?"<br/><br/>"Sacrifice helps," said a deep bass voice.<br/><br/>"You are a liar," said the masked man in reply. "It has nothing to do with that."<br/><br/>In reply, the deep voice only laughed, a horrible grating noise like boulders tumbling down a mountain. Millicent and Geronimo sped back up the corridor to rejoin their friends.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>The place that Lily had found for them was a modest boarding house mostly occupied by drag queens. While the others set up their room, Dr. Orange went over the papers Ruby had lifted from the Germans.<br/><br/>Most of them were from the Sicherheitsdienst, and seemed to be profiles of some kind. On one page he found a photograph of himself. <i>Wanted for return to Germany. High-value target, </i>the notation said. There were also files on Ruby ("Well, I had a lot of ex-boyfriends, I guess one of them was bound to be a Nazi," she said), and a rather extensive file on Jimmy. The notes on him boiled down to <i>trouble-maker who pokes his nose into too many things--terminate if possible</i>. <br/><br/>There were also orders to the local agents working for the Germans to keep all of them under surveillance. There was an entry in the file that the SD had received a report on them from an agent codenamed <i>Brille</i>.<br/><br/>"That means <i>glasses</i> in German," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"Lowman," muttered Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Why would whoever is in charge of the Nectar here try and reach out to other countries?" said Millicent. "And why would they <i>want</i> it? It's just trouble."<br/><br/>"You could put it in a bomb," mused Ruby. "Drop it on the other soldiers and attack during the confusion."<br/><br/><i>[That was one I didn't think of.]</i><br/><br/>"Don't forget that Brooks had some way to use it for mind-control," said Jimmy. "The local stuff doesn't seem to work like that...but they're experimenting."<br/><br/>"How can there always be a fifteen-minute wait for the bathroom?" said Geronimo, looking down the hall.<br/><br/>"It's just like school," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Less bitchy, more mascara," said Janet.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Millicent set out to find this mysterious "Savitree" who she thought was the "SS" from Brooks' and Trammel's correspondence. Fortunately most Siamese indexes used the first name to organize information.<br/><br/>While there were several candidates she finally settled on one. "Dr. Savitree Sirhan," she told the others. "MD, PhD in biochemistry. She was educated in Zurich, comes from a Chinese-Siamese family, and is interested in biological experimentation."<br/><br/>"Can we just kill her?" wondered Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"I think I found this Pramoj guy too," she continued. "Or at least his grandfather, who fought in Indochina. But his grandson was also in the Foreign Legion, although he didn't serve on the Western Front like Udom."<br/><br/>"Wait, <i>what</i>?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Udom was part of a FFL battalion sent to France. I think he mostly did labor, but he was there."<br/><br/>"What about Lowman?"<br/><br/>"He has a nice long paper trail...but not all the details hold up, and I can't find confirmation for some of the things."<br/><br/>"Count on it," said Dr. Orange, "he's a spy. I can catch the whiff of secret police from here."<br/><br/>"There's one more thing," said Millicent in the miserable tone that usually preceded her revelations. "I was doing some research on the monastery...but when I was reading a book on local little-known temples, I found Ramon Echevarria's name stamped on the check-out card, from 1922."<br/><br/><i>[Two Library Use spends by MP.]</i><br/><br/>"What was it about?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Among other things, something called the <i>Shrine of the White Buddha</i>. I don't know what that is, but it doesn't seem very well-known."<br/><br/>She flipped open the book to some photographs of the temple. Like most Siamese temples, it was based on the Indian style, with the tall conical representation of Mt. Meru in the center. Like many Siamese temples, it was cruciform in shape.<br/><br/>"Why does that thing keep reminding me of a European church?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"It's very subtle, but one arm of the temple is longer than the other," said Dr. Orange. "Maybe that's it...but that's strange. On the other hand, it's pretty much assumed that the Buddhists influenced the Gnostics...maybe somebody repaid the favor."<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449157/#Comment_449157" name="Item_144" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-26T23:55:40+00:00" title="October 26, 2015 11:55PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, what I remembered saying was that Millicent placed herself completely in Lily's hands.

When they showed up, they found a man in saffron robes sweeping the front stairs.<br/><br/>"Welcome," he said. "We so rarely get Europeans here. I am Phajol Khadpol."<br/><br/>"Why is it called the shrine of the White Buddha?" asked Millicent.<br/><br/>"It is descriptive; the interior is finished in white stone."<br/><br/>Jimmy narrowed his eyes. Phajol was dissembling about something, but was it because he couldn't share the teachings of his temple to Europeans, or a more profound secret.<br/><br/>Inside the shrine proved to indeed be made of white stone. The walls were covered with bas-reliefs of Buddha's Enlightenment, the churning of the Sea of Milk, and scenes from the <i>Ramayana</i>. But things seemed to be <i>off</i> somehow...a few of the carvings seemed to almost appear to be based on European art of the 11th century.<br/><br/><i>[RP made an Art History spend.]</i><br/><br/>There was a rather tall and muscular white man with a shaved head and wearing saffron robes cleaning the floors. He regarded them with suspicion, but otherwise left them alone. Jimmy started to pace around, muttering to himself, and finally rejoined the rest of the group.<br/><br/>"Remember how the outside had one longer arm than the others? Inside they're all the same length...I think there's some kind of secret room here," he told them.<br/><br/>"I'll distract him," said Ruby. "Millicent, I'll need you to translate into Siamese."<br/><br/>"<i>Ce n'est pas necessaire,</i>" the big man told them.<br/><br/>"He speaks French," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"How <i>fascinating</i>," said Ruby. She pointed at one wall. "Could you tell me about what <i>that</i> means?"<br/><br/>"I am not a priest...I fought in the Indochinese wars but now I am a monk..."<br/><br/>"Oh, but I'm sure you know something..."<br/><br/><i>[I think in-session this was spun as Reassurance, but it's clearly Flattery.]</i><br/><br/>While Ruby kept him distracted, Jimmy and Geronimo dashed for the arm that was suspiciously short. In one corner they found a small doorway with a curtain draped in front of it.<br/><br/><i>[Architecture use by JP, and accompanying Stealth roll with Geronimo piggybacking and contributing a point, which was good because JP rolled poorly.]</i><br/><br/>The room they found looked like it had been built by Siamese artists, but the style was distinctly western European, as was the enormous cross carved into one wall. Under it was an inscription:<br/><br/>Pauperes commilitones Christi Templique Salomonici<br/><br/><br/>"The Templars," said Jimmy in a strangely high-pitched voice. He began to read more of the Latin inscriptions.<br/><br/><br/>"I thought you didn't speak Latin," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"I don't," said Jimmy. "But Millicent does..."<br/><br/><i>[Hey, someone used their Gol-Goroth cherry! JP made a Stability spend to pick up a point of Latin.]</i><br/><br/>The art and the inscriptions related a history of the appearance of giant Mouths in the world, and the growth of a cult centered around combating them.<br/><br/>The very first mouth, as near as they could figure out, seemed to have appeared in Ethiopia. Other mouths spread out across and around the Arabian Sea, crossing into Into India. For some reason, they seemed to have been driven out of India (Geronimo, remember his history reading, thought it might have occurred during the suppression of Buddhism in India.) Eventually the cult made its way to Siam.<br/><br/>Then the story got really weird. A trio of Frankish knights, come east for the Crusades, kept going east. Somewhere in the Himalayas, they found a thing described as a "Yawning Chasm". After this encounter, they journeyed still further on, eventually reaching Siam. Two of them stayed, having joined with the local groups, but the third returned to Europe, where he seemed to have been important either in founding the Templars or the groups associated with the birth of the order. Meanwhile, it seemed that the First Mouth was destroyed around the birth of Christ.<br/><br/>"What mountain did they climb?" Geronimo asked Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Somebody chiseled it out...recently. Maybe fifteen years ago. My money is on Ramon." He took out a small camera and began to take photographs of the inscriptions.<br/><br/><i>[While I had planned this Templar revelation--don't worry folks, this isn't in the actual book; this is all me--in the same episode as they found the Nazi connection (also all me), but what the heck.</i><br/><br/><i>As RP said, "Now I'm officially in a Pulp game."</i><br/><br/><i>As it turns out, there's just a </i>sliver<i> of plausibility here; the Gnostics really were influenced by Buddhism, the Templars have long been suspected of having included Gnostic elements into their rites, and the communication across the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea was a lot more common than is commonly understood. So the idea of an anti-Liar cult spreading among the Buddhist (and Jewish! and ultimately Christian!) communities of southern India, which were spread in a diaspora into southeast Asia.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>"Thank you," said Millicent to the big man. She could see Jimmy and Geronimo sneaking back into the room. "Are there any other shrines nearby we should visit? We're trying to see as many of them as we can."<br/><br/>"I suppose over towards the river you can find some," said the big man.<br/><br/>"Thank you," she said. They all streamed out of temple and stood in the muggy sunlight. Above the monsoon clouds were already beginning to sweep in from the sea.<br/><br/>"Templars!" they kept repeating to themselves. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449177/#Comment_449177" name="Item_147" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-28T04:49:17+00:00" title="October 28, 2015  4:49AM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I also cut the part where Lily tried to teach Millicent the price schedule of a European prostitute...</blockquote>\n10 baht for a hand job, right?

The rest of them tried to decide which path to follow to untangle this knot of troubles they found themselves bound in.<br/><br/>They tried to formulate a plan to get back into the monastery and find Pramoj, going over and over different iterations while drinking watered down alcohol at Lily's bar. They were close to finding a plan when a couple of tough looking Siamese men came in.<br/><br/>"Those don't look like Lily's crowd," said Jimmy. They got up as inconspicuously as possible and went into the kitchen, hoping to warn Lily. But before they could reach the back door, it was kicked in and a couple of Siamese street muscle and a European man pushed their way inside.<br/><br/>Millicent shoved Ruby and Geronimo behind a counter, and then she and Jimmy tried to fade into a corner. From the main room there was the sound of a burst of automatic fire, followed by the sound of someone getting slapped, hard. They heard Lily scream.<br/><br/>"That was a German gun," said Jimmy to Millicent. They could hear someone shouting in German-accented Siamese, "Tell me where they are!" The sound of breaking glass came from the other room.<br/><br/>Jimmy's face grew grim. He gathered himself and dashed for the back door. One of the thugs fired off a burst behind him, but he was too quick and managed to dash up the alleyway. He doubled back around the front of the bar and kicked in the front door.<br/><br/><i>[Athletics roll for Jimmy to get out the door, made fictively possible by the element of surprise.]</i><br/><br/>Two submachine guns were leveled at him by Siamese thugs. A German man had his Luger to Lily's head. "Mr. Wright," he said. "So nice of you to join us."<br/><br/>"You think I would run in here without a plan? You think I don't have something set up? You should know by now what happens to people who hurt my friends," said Jimmy.<br/><br/><i>[Intimidate spend by JP to keep the Germans from shooting anyone.]</i><br/><br/>"<i>H\xe4nde hoch</i>," said the German. He barked something to the thugs. They relieved Jimmy of his pistol, and then shoved him into the street with the barrels of their guns.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Millicent dashed through a market square and into a dilapidated teahouse. "There's trouble at Lily's," she said breathlessly in Siamese. "Germans are breaking the place apart."<br/><br/>From behind a table, the man she had been told was the one to whom Lily paid protection money yawned. "I don't get paid to fight Germans," he said. "I get paid to keep the police from shutting down that [slur]'s place."<br/><br/><i>[Oral History spend to find this guy.]</i><br/><br/>"You're going to let some Germans come in and push you around on your turf? And look weak in front of everyone?"<br/><br/><i>[RP: You're the mob! Have some self-respect!</i><br/><br/><i>Intimidate spend, creatively, by MP.]</i><br/><br/>"All right, all right," the gangster sighed. He picked up a club and nodded at two of his soldiers.<br/><br/>"They have guns," said Millicent.<br/><br/>The gangster grabbed a shotgun.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When they arrived in front of Lily's, Millicent and the gangsters could see two thugs trying to shove Jimmy into a car.<br/><br/>"Ooo boy," muttered one of the gangsters.<br/><br/>Jimmy, sensing his chance, suddenly burst forward, slipped across the back seat of the car, and then out the other side.<br/><br/>"Halt!" shouted the German. One of the thugs raised his gun, but then glanced back at the German, unsure if even the Nazis wanted him to open up on a crowded square.<br/><br/>"You two get him!" shouted the German as he waved them towards Jimmy. "You two get that <i>Amerikanerin</i>!"<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jimmy dashed through another crowded market square. People with baskets of fish and rolls of silk crowded through the square, past the vendors barking their wares aggressively. As he ran, he nearly plowed into a man in a beat up fedora and weathered leather jacket.<br/><br/>"Jimmy?" said the man, incredulously.<br/><br/>"Indy?"<br/><br/>"No time!" they chorused together and ran off in opposite directions. Jimmy began to scale a pile of crates leaning against one building.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449730/#Comment_449730" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-24T15:44:36+00:00" title="November 24, 2015  3:44PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 24, 2015 6:50PM by Aviatrix.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode X: Ruby, My Dear (Part 2)</b><br/><br/>"What are you doing?" said Millicent in German as the two thugs approached her. "You! I was so close to getting him! Why are you messing up my investigation!"<br/><br/>Everyone stopped.<br/><br/><i>[Intimidation spend by MP.]</i><br/><br/>"What are you talking about, <i>fr\xe4ulein</i>?" said the German.<br/><br/>Millicent opened up a leather wallet and waved a quite convincing copy of an official German identification paper.<br/><br/>The German yelled at his thugs to go after Jimmy, and came up to examine Millicent's papers. "Liesl Steiner of the RHSA," he muttered. "I was not aware of any other operations. Who sent you?"<br/><br/>"SS-<i>Obergruppenf\xfchrer</i> Heydrich, of course," said Millicent. "I report...directly to him."<br/><br/><i>[Bureaucracy use here to know the right German. The papers probably had been lifted by Millicent at some point, and since we were still using Covers at this stage, MP dumped some points into the "Liesl" identity.]</i><br/><br/>"I should still have been informed," muttered the German. "This is not procedure! I must take you back to the embassy to confirm this with our superiors..."<br/><br/>"I must return to them before they know who I am. You have to hit me."<br/><br/>"I'd prefer not to hit a <i>fr\xe4ulein</i>..."<br/><br/>"I'd prefer not to be hit. But I must keep up appearances.

But you're near the river...</i><br/><i>RP, going nuts: Yes yes yes! I want to do that thing...with the boats...gimme a pencil!]</i><br/><br/>Ruby and Geronimo fled to the edge of the river bank. A ferry was just about to pull away from the slip and they raced for it, leaping from the bank onto a fishing boat. There was a splash behind them as one of their pursuers fell into the river. The other landed with a thud and grabbed at Ruby's hair. Geronimo seized an oar from the bottom of the boat and cross-checked him into the water. As the ferry lumbered past, they jumped aboard.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Jimmy clambered to the top of a building, tossing bundles of bahts at the residents to distract him. The two thugs chasing him were almost within knife range when he saw the ferry with Ruby and Geronimo onboard chugging below him.<br/><br/>He jumped from the building, trailing a bolt of cloth, and smashed into tarpaulin covering the middle of the boat, rolled off of it, and landed on his feet next to Ruby.<br/>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/> They met up with Millicent at Wat Pho, the beautiful porcelain temple. After Jimmy managed to choke back his anger about Millicent's shiner, they began to make plans for returning to the Noble Pali Monastery.<br/><br/>The eventual decision was to send Millicent, in her Liesl Steiner guise, inside to talk to the Germans. Geronimo would resume his Basque sailor identity and try and keep an eye on Millicent, while Jimmy and Ruby would try and sneak inside to find and talk to Pramoj.<br/><br/>That night Millicent imperiously strode into the temple and walked boldly to the German box. A monk ran to fetch Thawi to talk to her.<br/><br/>"I was not informed by the embassy that there was another coming tonight," he said.<br/><br/>"I have come because of the inept handling of Herr Wright by your friends in the embassy," she said.<br/><br/>"Yes...no offense,  <i>fr\xe4ulein</i>, but these Germans are bumblers."<br/><br/>"One cannot pick one's countrymen. Or coworkers."<br/><br/>"Yes. I think this Lowman is a homosexual. You should report him."<br/>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Ruby and Jimmy, dressed in black clothes and with balaclavas over their faces, crept to the one spot along the walls of the monastery they hoped wasn\u2019t observable from the rest of the complex. Together they shimmied over the wall and dropped into a quiet courtyard. <br/>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>"Obviously we can't show you all our secrets," said Udom, leading Millicent on a tour. "We're keeping the supply hidden for now...but you can see our fighters. So far the program is working well--the unique discipline of my martial arts controls the impulses the drug creates. At least in Dr. Sirhan's formulation."<br/><br/>"How long has she been working on this?"<br/><br/>"Several years...surely you were informed..."<br/><br/>"I am confirming our information," said Millicent, scribbling down a note.<br/><br/>"Oh..." said Udom, clearly nervous. "This is Pramoj."<br/><br/>"Ah, a Fascist," said Pramoj. He was the man in the tattered Foreign Legion uniform and face mask Millicent had seen on her last trip.<br/><br/>"What do you do here?" she asked.<br/><br/>"I am the caretaker. The fighting areas are difficult to maintain, but I do what I can."<br/><br/>"And the Source is difficult to work with, I'm sure."<br/><br/>"What would you know of the Source?"<br/><br/>"Did your people not tell you? I have been with Mr. Wright for some time. I am aware of many things."<br/><br/>"Pramoj will take care of you," said Udom. "If you will excuse me, I have one or two things to check on..."<br/><br/><i>Like me,</i> she thought. "I've been to L.A.," she said to Pramoj after Udom left.<br/><br/>"It's not my understanding the Germans have had anything to do with that."<br/><br/>"Not officially."<br/><br/>Pramoj regarded her skeptically.

Jimmy was keeping an eye out for anyone following them, which is why he didn't notice Ruby running smack into a female acolyte.<br/><br/>The young woman looked at both of them, and then began to scream. Ruby whipped out a blackjack and smashed it into her head. The woman staggered back, still screaming, and Jimmy pounced forward and slapped her. The acolyte fell to the ground, moaning. "Don't kill me," she said.<br/><br/>"Just stop screaming," whispered Jimmy.<br/><br/>He helped her up. The sound of sandaled feet came from one branch of the t-shaped intersection they were standing in.<br/><br/>"This way," said Jimmy. "There's an ornamental fish pond down here. C'mon!"<br/><br/>"Fish pond?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"I studied the floorplans!"<br/><br/><i>[Architecture spend by JP to find the best way to go.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Geronimo managed to sneak past the guards ringing the fight arena and enter the temple complex. He flattened himself against the wall as several blue-robed monks hurried by. "Somebody was screaming! This way!" one said.<br/><br/>"Probably Ruby," he muttered, and moved on in the direction he thought the Mouth lay.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>"What I don't understand," said Millicent, "is how you can work with a being...so alien...that there's no trust, no possibility of trust."<br/><br/>"It Lies, in other words," said Pramoj. "I have seen many things in war and battle...and I have a relationship with Dr. Sirhan. It does not matter what it is--it's personal."<br/><br/>"But are either of you in control of this thing?"<br/><br/>"I don't think anyone can control it, although Dr. Sirhan flatters herself that she is."<br/><br/>"That's my concern. In L.A., when Trammel was in the hospital, a man who worked with him tried to take over the business and learned--fatally--how unprepared he was."<br/><br/>"I have taken...precautions in that respect. If it should ever become necessary, I have prepared a way to destroy it. But why should you want to do that? Do you not wish to exploit it?"<br/><br/>"I think that might be a little too dangerous."<br/><br/>"You're not like any Nazi I've ever met."<br/><br/>"How many have you met?"<br/><br/>"One is more than enough. I've met too many."<br/><br/>"There was a smaller mouth in L.A. that talked to me...it lied to me and told the truth at the same time, I think. I'm afraid if you listen to it for too long, the lies might become the truth."<br/><br/>"I believe your <i>F\xfchrer</i> has said words to that effect."<br/><br/>"I don't want what that thing is capable of saying to become the truth. Am I making any sense?"<br/><br/>"A great deal. But why should I trust a Nazi?"<br/><br/>"Why should I work with anyone who would try to exploit that thing?"<br/><br/>"I have a personal loyalty. Like you do, with Hitler."<br/><br/>"If you could set up things in your own fashion, how would things be set up here?"<br/><br/>"They wouldn't be set up at all. I'd destroy the Mouth and leave this place."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Geronimo found himself walking down the long corridor that led to the Mouth, having passed the staging area for the acolytes who were imbibing Nectar and driving themselves into a furious rage. As he passed a small room, he heard Millicent talking with Pramoj.<br/><br/>As he approached the room at the end of the corridor, he heard a voice: "<i>Hermano</i>? <i>Mi hermano</i>? Are you there?"<br/><br/>The voice was that of Rodolfo, his dead brother. If it was an imitation, it was a perfect one. He closed his eyes, breathing heavily, and clutched his rosary.<br/><br/><i>[Aaaaand a three point stability loss. Quoth RP, "how attached to your Stability are you?"]</i><br/><br/>Geronimo grasped his rosary, muttering an <i>Ave Maria</i>. <br/><br/>"Brother, are you out there?" the voice continued. "I can't see you, it's so dark in here..."<br/><br/>Geronimo ran into the room at the end of the hall. "Rodolfo!"<br/><br/><i>[Hard Driver on Geronimo's Remorse drive, so 2 points of Stability back.]</i><br/><br/>He looked around, but couldn't see anything except for a pit in the center of the room. Grillwork on the ceiling let in some dim light and the noise of the fighting ring, and the floor was slightly inclined towards the pit. It seemed that this place was used to keep the arena clean--the blood and carnage from the combats was sluiced down into it from above.<br/><br/>"I can't see you, brother! I think I'm at the bottom of a well," said the voice.<br/><br/>"But you're dead!" said Geronimo, distraught.<br/><br/>"I don't know what I am...I'm dead? But how can I talk to you if I'm dead?"<br/><br/>"Where could you be?" said Geronimo. As he approached the edge of the pit, a long pink tongue--more like a tentacle--shot out of it and wrapped itself around him. The saliva burned caustically as it soaked him.<br/><br/>Down the hallway, Millicent and Pramoj heard the scream. "Someone is with the Source," said Pramoj.<br/><br/>"What should we do?" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Investigate," said Pramoj. He pulled a cattle prod out of the corner of the room and trotted down the hall.<br/><br/>Geronimo twisted his arms until he could get purchase and then threw the tongue off of him. He pulled the knife he had concealed in the small of his back out and slashed at the tongue, and then fell back on the tiled floor.<br/><br/><i>[TN 4 Athletics test to get free, then a Weapons attack.]</i><br/><br/>Pramoj came into the room and jabbed his cattle prod into the tongue. "Get back, you lying thing!" he shouted. The tongue retreated back down into the pit. "Who are you, and what are you doing here?" he said to Geronimo.<br/><br/>"I was here for the fights, and I heard it calling in my brother's voice...so I came to investigate."<br/><br/>"Normally I would say that is highly unlikely that you could hear anything over the noise of the fights, but the Mouth has many tricks. But now you have seen what you must not see."<br/><br/>"He's with me," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"This is not a Nazi," said Pramoj, taken back.<br/><br/>"I am here to destroy it," said Geronimo, getting to his feet.<br/><br/>"We should talk," said Pramoj. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449820/#Comment_449820" name="Item_157" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-30T16:32:45+00:00" title="November 30, 2015  4:32PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode X: Ruby, My Dear (Part 4)</b><br/><br/>Jimmy and Ruby dragged their hostage into the room with the ornamental pond. The young woman began to bite Jimmy's hand, clearly trying to say something.<br/><br/>He lifted his hand for a second. "<i>Tiger!</i>" she hissed.<br/><br/>"Is that a Siamese word meaning <i>beautiful bird that will never hurt us</i>?" said Ruby hopefully.<br/><br/>In answer, a low rumbling growl came from the darkness. Through the eerie moonlight, the enormous tiger they had seen with Udom stalked towards them, fur flashing silver as it walked.<br/><br/>Ruby fished into her satchel as the tiger began to tense its muscles for a spring. She fished out a flare, smashed it against the wall and then jabbed at the cat with the brightly sparking lit end.<br/><br/>Someone began to bang on the door as Ruby, Jimmy, and the acolyte began to circle around the room. "Back, back!" said Ruby. "James, what am I doing?"<br/><br/><i>[Preparedness by Ruby to have a flare, and then a 1 point Stability loss for being in close proximity to one of the most fearsome predators on four legs.</i><br/><br/><i>"This was about your best bet," I told RP, "other than getting into a fight with a tiger.

They raced towards the door on the opposite side of the koi pond, slipped it open, and ducked into the next room. They spun and bolted it shut. Jimmy swung a heavy bar down into brackets on the door for good measure.<br/><br/>"Oh good, you must be next!" said a voice behind them. Turning around, they saw one of the blue-robed acolytes standing next to one of the gates to the arena. He nodded at their acolyte/hostage. "Going to the fights. Good. Best way to get your blue robes. You guys have your Nectar yet?"<br/><br/>"Yes," said Jimmy quickly.<br/><br/>Ruby bit her hand as the man offered her a flask. Jimmy grabbed her arm and twisted it behind her back as she lunged forward for the precious drug.<br/><br/>"You sure?" said the monk dubiously. "You look like you could use some."<br/><br/>"I'm not--" the acolyte tried to said, but Jimmy glared at her, then at the monk.<br/><br/>"Well, I think you could do with a refresher--the stuff wears off...but I guess you know best," he said, and then opened the gates.<br/><br/><i>[Ruby failed her Stability check, but luckily Jimmy restrained her, then used (he was out of points) Intimidation to get the monk off their case.]</i><br/><br/>He shoved them forward toward the middle of the ring. Several men came stumbling out toward them. The noise of the crowd rose as the gates closed and the men began to run at them.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Millicent, Geronimo and Pramoj were still talking when they heard the deep toll of a gong being struck. "That's the intruder alert," said Pramoj. "Did you bring anyone with you, my fine freedom-fighting friends? Such strange goings on. Are these your people...fr\xe4ulein?"<br/><br/>"It's possible," said Millicent meekly.<br/><br/>"You came here to destroy the Mouth, but your people are trying to buy the serum? Something doesn't add up here. And I know Germans love arithmetic."<br/><br/>"We just want to stop those things," she pleaded.<br/><br/>"I see. I have planted explosives all around the Mouth--I poured the concrete, and I was a military engineer in the Foreign Legion. However, I don't think that's enough--even if you were to throw explosives down it, or around it. You need to do both, an exterior explosion to collapse things around it, and an internal explosion to rip it apart. At least I think so...if we could ever find where they lead, maybe we could destroy all of them."<br/><br/>"Working on it," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"I would have destroyed the Mouth a long time again, except first I'm pretty sure Udom would kill me and second...I would need assurances that Sri Sirhan would be preserved. Or at least given the opportunity to escape."<br/><br/>"She's not here?"<br/><br/>"No. She's on an island somewhere. There's a barge that goes down there from time to time. If you look at the waterfront, you could probably find it."<br/><br/>"We don't plan to...harm her now."<br/><br/>"I know she is not what she was...but I still...if you wish to do this tonight, we must hurry and be careful. Do you have an escape plan?"<br/><br/>"I was thinking, pardon the vernacular, <i>run like fuck</i>?"<br/><br/>"There are many more of them than us. On the other hand, I have two more than I thought I would. It's an old building...not everyone knows their way around like I do."<br/><br/>"We can set off the explosives while you wait elsewhere, throwing suspicion off of you," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"We'll need to prepare some explosives, and get the Mouth to eat them...perhaps inside a body of some kind."<br/><br/>"One of the fighters?" said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Perhaps. Let's check to see if we have a side of beef first."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449842/#Comment_449842" name="Item_158" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-01T16:37:44+00:00" title="December  1, 2015  4:37PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode X: Ruby, My Dear (Part 5)</b><br/><br/>Ruby scanned the crowd. She could see Udom and Lowman up in their box. A gong chimed.<br/><br/>The four men hopped up on Nectar loped towards them. Each was wearing a different colored sash around their waist. Red-sash and Green-sash peeled off to pounce on Jimmy, while Yellow-sash headed toward Ruby and Blue-sash to the acolyte, who dropped to the ground shrieking. Ruby frantically looked around for a weapon. She scrambled toward a spear lying in the dust and swept it up just as the Yellow-sash reached her.<br/><br/><i>[Preparedness test by RP to find a spear.]</i><br/><br/>Her stance changed, became somehow more masculine, and she expertly swept the butt of the spear around, making a space between her and her attacker. She spun it fluidly around and then jabbed at him with the spearhead.<br/><br/><i>[RP borrowed some Weapons points from Jimmy using her Gol-Goroth cherry and went down to 3 Stability.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy ducked and rolled between Red-sash and Green-sash, who slammed into each other. They snarled and fell to the ground struggling as he backed away.<br/><br/>Ruby thrust the spear forward and sank it into Yellow-sash\u2019s chest. The man screamed and then began <i>walking up the spear</i> towards her--too late, she realized that the crossguards on the spear had been removed, probably to provoke just such a situation.<br/><br/>Before she could fully register what was happening, Jimmy grabbed the spear out of her hands and, overpowering the man stuck on it like a cocktail olive, jabbed the head of the spear into Blue-sash, who was about to rip the throat of the screaming acolyte with his teeth. The spear jammed into his back, and he screamed and snapped at his fellow pin cushion impersonator further down the shaft.<br/><br/>Ruby spun around just as Green-sash rushed her. She dropped into a compact judo stance and flipped him toward the men impaled on the spear. He landed in between them, snapping the shaft in two, releasing the other men, who screamed and began running around with half a spear each sticking through them.<br/><br/>Red-sash tried to pounce on Jimmy, but he spun into his own judo style throw, rolling the man over his back and smashing him to the ground. The man rolled up coughing blood.<br/><br/><i>[I based that on an actual nasty aikido technique I used to suffer through. Jimmy was borrowing scuffling from Millicent at this point. All but one of the attackers was down to negative Health at this point, but Bangkok Nectar makes them able to keep fighting even when Hurt.]</i><br/><br/>Ruby kicked the legs out from the man with the spear head jammed through him, and then slammed the jagged end of the spear down, forcing the point into the ground and pinning Blue-sash to the dirt momentarily before he managed to lift himself off of the stubby wooden shaft.<br/><br/>Green-sash growled and pounded his chest. "I'm going to rip your arms off and beat you to death with them!" he shouted at Jimmy, then began to stride forward. Jimmy scrambled in the dirt looking for a rock and came up with the broken hand of a statue of the Buddha. He smashed it into the man's face, causing blood to spray out from his mangled nose.<br/><br/><i>[Preparedness test by JP.]</i><br/><br/>Ruby pulled another flare out of her satchel, struck it into sparking life, and jammed it into the face of Blue-sash. She felt something give as it crushed into the man's eye socket and he dropped to the ground howling in agony. She glanced up at the stands and saw Udom, clearly now aware that something had gone wrong, signaling to his guards.<br/><br/>Jimmy pulled the broken spear out of ground. He charged at Green-sash and jammed the spear with a vicious uppercut into the soft spot where his jaw met the neck. A gout of blood shot out and  the man dropped into the dirt.<br/><br/>Ruby squared off against Yellow-sash. She ran forward and chopped hard at his throat, dropping him to the ground. She backed away until she was behind Jimmy.<br/><br/>Red-sash paced back and forth, sizing Jimmy up. He reached down and wrenched the broken spear shaft out of Yellow-sash, spinning it around in a competent-looking kata. He glared at Jimmy and then grinned.<br/><br/>Jimmy threw the spearhead at him, flipping it overhand like a dagger. It flew into his throat and he fell down, spraying blood from a severed artery.<br/><br/>Blue-robed monks swept Jimmy and Ruby back under the stands as the crowd screamed their approval and bloodlust down on them.<br/><br/><i>[This turned out to be one of my favorite combats of the campaign; I normally would have cross-cut over to Millicent and Geronimo, but everybody was entertained by the fight, so we stuck with it and then took a break.]</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449855/#Comment_449855" name="Item_159" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-02T17:00:05+00:00" title="December  2, 2015  5:00PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode X: Ruby, My Dear (Part 6)</b><br/><br/>Pramoj, Geronimo and Millicent watched Ruby and Geronimo come back under the stands, accompanied by a couple of blue-robed monks. "Maybe we can help them," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Are they with you?" asked Pramoj. <br/><br/>Millicent nodded. "So, then, we are all agreed we're doing this tonight?" continued Pramoj. "Very well. One moment."<br/><br/>Ruby collapsed on a bench in the recovery room. Jimmy kept eyeing the door--he knew it was only a matter of time before Udom's men arrived. As he watched, a man wearing a surgical mask entered.<br/><br/>"That was really great," said one of the blue-robes to Ruby. "Where did you find that flare?"<br/><br/>"Excuse me," said Pramoj to the monks. "I need to have a word with you." They turned around to look at him.<br/><br/>He pulled out a Luger pistol and shot them both in the head. "Are you with Liesl Steiner?" he said to Ruby and Jimmy. Stunned, they nodded.<br/><br/>"Come with me."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Shortly afterward they found themselves on the edge of the room containing the Mouth. From the well in the floor the great Tongue rose in the air, swaying in a horrific fashion and dripping with Nectar.<br/><br/>Ruby twitched and began to walk toward the Mouth, entranced by the smell of Nectar. She stumbled to her hands and knees as the Tongue began to arc towards her, dripping smoking drops of caustic fluid.<br/><br/><i>[Ruby failed her TN 5 Stability check to resist the Nectar.]</i><br/><br/>Geronimo grabbed her by the waist and dragged her back out of the room. "I think I'll sit over in that corner," she whispered. Millicent began to chant the Nahuatl song Elena had taught them.<br/><br/>Pramoj appeared, dragging a body down the hall, a gunnysack slung over his back. He cut a hole in the body's chest with his knife, and began to stuff Semtex into the cavity. "I need one of you to throw this into the mouth," he said.<br/><br/>Jimmy sighed, waited until Pramoj was done, and then hoisted the body in a fireman's carry. He walked towards the Mouth, singing the Nahuatl song.<br/><br/>"I don't like that song," boomed a deeply unpleasant voice all around him as he got closer.<br/><br/>Without faltering in his singing, Jimmy dumped the body unceremoniously into the Mouth. The Tongue wrapped itself around the corpse and dragged it toward its gullet. Jimmy staggered back in the direction of the entrance.<br/><br/>"I advise running," said Pramoj. He clicked a button on his detonator.<br/><br/>"This way, Mr. Wright, Mr. Cuevas!" shouted Millicent. She grabbed their hands and tugged them down the hall. Behind them there was a loud bang as the charges Pramoj had planted inside the corpse detonated. They all collapsed in a courtyard a hundred meters from the Mouth.<br/><br/>"Hold your ears," said Pramoj, and then he fired the second set of charges.<br/><br/>The ground buckled under them, scattering them around the courtyard. A huge mushroom cloud of evil-looking yellow dust leaped into the air, and smoke and dust rolled over them in a choking, miasmic wave. Ringing filled their ears, deafening them.<br/><br/>Udom and several of his security lackeys burst into the courtyard. They looked around at Jimmy, Ruby, Millicent, and Geronimo. Finally Udom saw Pramoj. <i>You</i>, he said, not that anyone could hear him.<br/><br/>Everyone went for their guns. \n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Ruby fired off a shot at one of the monks, who scrambled for some cover. Jimmy pulled out his backup piece, flipped it in the air to Geronimo while drawing his other pistol, and the two of them blasted away at Udom.<br/><br/>The two remaining monks sprang at them, whirling around their staffs. Ruby and Geronimo shot both of them, but they continued forward, eyes rolling wildly.<br/><br/>Millicent grabbed Pramoj and pulled him down behind a statue in the corner. "I made a promise to keep you safe!" she whispered.<br/><br/>Udom scrambled toward the exit of the courtyard. Jimmy double-tapped him in the chest, then put another round in the back of his head to make sure.<br/><br/>The two monks dropped their staffs and made posthaste out of the courtyard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449873/#Comment_449873" name="Item_160" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-03T17:19:41+00:00" title="December  3, 2015  5:19PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode X: Ruby, My Dear (Part 7)</b><br/><br/>After trying to throw people off their trail by booking a room in a nice hotel--and leaving a note in several languages saying "Better luck next time (Millicent left her copy of <i>Lady Chatterly's Lover </i>as well), they went to a bad waterfront hotel run by one of Lily's cousins. He normally charged by the hour, but after grumbling about "Li Chu" and degeneracy, gave them a couple of rooms--including, of course, Pramoj.<br/><br/>"He doesn't want us to kill Savitree," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"It was a condition that was necessary for me to agree to blow up the place I lived," said Pramoj.<br/><br/>"I understand," said Ruby. "You want a job?"<br/><br/>"She means that we want to find the thing's body and kill it," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Oh," said Pramoj. "That's crazy. But all right. If you want to find her, you should go down to the docks and find the barge."<br/><br/>"But we might have to hurt her if we find her," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"I'm not saying she shouldn't be stopped. You've destroyed the Source, so if we can shut down the rest of the operation...I can maybe find her a place. I owe her that much."<br/><br/>"What does her operation do?" said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"She was trying to find some kind of super-soldier serum. That was Thawi's job, to find a training regimen that would work on people even after they took Nectar. I think she was trying to find a way to mix the Mexico City Nectar with our Nectar...if you use the sex-drive Nectar as a reward system, you'd have an army maker that no totalitarian government could resist."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Ruby eventually cleaned up using the outdoor, cold water shower--which, however, was pretty refreshing considering the constant damp, rain, and humidity of rainy season Bangkok. She found Geronimo smoking on the narrow balcony of their room.<br/><br/>"There was a tiger," she blubbered, falling into his arms.<br/><br/><i>[In session I had a brief scene where Millicent encountered the spirit--or so she thought--of Noor al-Buraki from the previous campaign. I had an idea of making this a bigger plot point later in the campaign, but that never worked out, so the main takeaway is that she gained the ability to turn Sanity loss into Cthulhu Mythos rating.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>The next morning Geronimo and Jimmy went down in the pre-dawn twilight to talk with the fishermen on the waterfront. After a while, they got the number of a docking slip where a "crazy American" would dock a barge that made frequent trips down the river to some island nobody knew anything about.<br/><br/>They waited there for a while. Geronimo smoked pensively. The sun rose, causing the air to almost shudder as it bloomed into heat. Clouds had already gathered, however, and soon a fine rain was falling on them.<br/><br/>A motorized barge came chugging up the river, spreading diesel fumes and blue smoke everywhere. They could hear a voice singing in French with a cracked American accent:<br/><br/><i>Je me souviens la nuit...</i><br/><i>Et la valse du Tennessee...</i><br/><br/>After it tied up, a small, wiry woman came out of the pilothouse and sauntered down the dock. She caught sight of Jimmy and froze.<br/><br/>"No no no," she said. "Oh no. I told you I never wanted to see you again after Danger Island!"<br/><br/>"Joyce Summers," said Jimmy, surprised. <br/><br/>"You keep him away from me," Joyce told Geronimo.<br/><br/>"This was not planned," said Jimmy. <br/><br/>"You're the reason I don't fly planes anymore, you know that? The only thing in the world I loved to do and I can't do it no more!"<br/><br/>"We don't need you to fly a plane," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"No! I still like piloting <i>boats</i>," pleaded Joyce.<br/><br/>"I promise you this won't stop you piloting boats. We don't even need you to pilot this one...just leave it for us," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"I need a drink," muttered Joyce.

Private island, owned by the Sirhan family. I run down supplies--diesel for the generators, food, medical supplies. Lots of that, actually."<br/><br/>"How many people on the island?" said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Maybe twenty or thirty, based on the food. But I've never seen more than five or six walking around."<br/><br/>"What kind of security do they have?"<br/><br/>"Couple of guys with machine guns. And that Savitree lady."<br/><br/>"When's your next shipment?"<br/><br/>"Making a run tomorrow."<br/><br/>"We'll be on it. Just do your job normally, and it will be fine."<br/><br/>"Do you own the barge?" asked Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Yeah, it's mine--I got paid for that last job I did for you, couldn't go home...so I bought a barge and been making money in Thailand."<br/><br/>"How much is it?"<br/><br/>"It's not for sale."<br/><br/>"Not buying it.

Lily's cousin knew a guy who knew a guy who knew a guy in the Triads. That evening they went to a small restaurant. "I see you were sent by my good friend Wu," said the Maitre d'. He handed them a menu. Printed on the inside were silhouettes of guns.<br/><br/>"I'd like a salad," said Ruby, pointing at a rifle.<br/><br/>"Excellent choice. Perhaps something...spicy."<br/><br/>"Perfect."<br/><br/>"We have it in stock tonight. Anything else?

Jimmy, Millicent, Ruby, and Geronimo slipped off the back of the barge and began swimming toward the shore, towing an inflatable raft with their equipment in it.<br/><br/>Even at this distance they could hear the sound of generators from the island. There was some kind of largish summerhouse near the dock Joyce was tying up at, and they could see several Europeans standing on the pavilion of the house.<br/><br/>They made landfall at a sheltered cove out of the sightlines of the main house. Ruby scouted a bit ahead into the forest and found a wire fence strung up across the island. Topping it were two strands of barbed wire with heavy insulators attached, indicating they were electrified.<br/><br/>When the rest of them arrived, Ruby pointed out that the fence was designed to keep things <i>inside</i>, not outside.<br/><br/>With some difficulty they found a tree that they could use to swing over the fence. They crept through the island, listening intently. It was clear that there were other generators than the ones near the house, as if there was another complex nearby.<br/><br/><i>[Outdoorsman spend by GP to get them over the fence.]</i><br/><br/>They broke through the woods and saw two long, low buildings directly ahead. They could see the generator complex between them, but the fence blocked their way to them. As they watched, they heard a klaxon give a short bark and there was the sound of a gate sliding open.<br/><br/>Something came crashing through the bush toward them, but it stopped abruptly.<br/><br/>Millicent quietly stalked forward into the brush, trying to not even breathe. She was pretty sure she had gotten past whatever it was that had been moving toward them.<br/><br/>"I have a bad feeling about this," said Jimmy. "Everyone into the trees."<br/><br/>They waited a while as the dusk deepened around them. Suddenly Ruby saw some motion at the base of the tree. At first she thought she was seeing things. "Lizards don't get that big..." she thought. <br/><br/>The thing, which looked like a ten foot long monitor lizard, looked up and hissed at her. She could see that its mouth had been...mutilated, somehow. It looked like a...a...Mouth.<br/><br/>She could smell the Nectar coming from it even at this height.<br/><br/>Jimmy looked down. "It's a Komodo dragon!" he shouted. The dragon turned to face him, and a long, sticky tongue shot into the tree and wrapped around his ankle. It turned out that a ten-foot long monitor lizard was quite strong.<br/><br/>Geronimo fired a shot from his silenced pistol at the lizard, but the dragon kept its hold on Jimmy's ankle. Geronimo drew his heavy survival knife and slashed at the tongue. The dragon hissed and let go of his ankle. Jimmy managed to pull himself back up into the tree.<br/><br/>"It burnt my pants with its saliva," he muttered.<br/><br/>Jimmy, Ruby, and Millicent shot down at the dragon but all of them missed. It plowed into Ruby's tree, shaking it viciously, and she tried to cling to the branches but fell to the ground.<br/><br/>"Ruby!" said Millicent. Her eyes grew large as she began to mutter to herself. "Go away, go away, go away..."<br/><br/>The dragon, and Millicent, both vanished.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Millicent found herself inside a concrete room, evidently a cage or animal pen of some kind. Heavy bars divided the room in half. She glanced behind her and saw a gate of iron bars over the exit to the jungle. The dragon was at her feet, and a very confused Siamese man with a mop stopped cleaning the cage.<br/><br/>"You..." he said and fainted.<br/><br/><i>You did not know how to move me very well</i>, hissed the dragon's Mouth.<br/><br/>"I can move myself," she said, and suddenly was standing on the other side of the bars. <br/><br/>"Oh," she said, and fainted.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>She came to on a bed, strapped tightly down on it. A Siamese woman in a lab coat was looking down at her.<br/><br/>"Dr. Sirhan?" she said.<br/><br/>"Yes," said Savitree. "Please tell me who you are, and how you came to my island?"<br/><br/>"I wanted to tell you that Pramoj was still alive."<br/><br/>"That's good, but that doesn't answer my question," said Savitree with a smile.<br/><br/>"I'm not entirely sure how I got here..."<br/><br/>"I find that very difficult to believe. There are only a few ways to come here."<br/><br/>"I didn't climb...I was outside, and now I'm inside."<br/><br/>"But how were you on the island in the first place?"<br/><br/>"I swam."<br/><br/>"Ah, I find that hard to believe. Swam from Patthaya? The channel is not <i>that</i> narrow. Swam from a boat, then. But which boat?"<br/><br/>"I came on that barge they said might be coming to you."<br/><br/>"That is very interesting...I'd like you to come see something." Sirhan called to a couple of hulking orderlies to let Millicent up. As she walked with them, Millicent realized she must be in the summerhouse.<br/><br/>Dr. Sirhan led her out onto the pavilion. Into the warm light of sunset. Far upriver she could see the barge approaching, still at least forty minutes away.<br/><br/>"That's...that's not possible!" shouted Millicent. "That's not possible!"<br/><br/>"I think perhaps it is, although it has been a long time since I have seen anything like that." She turned to the orderlies. "We should be on our guard. Why...don't we let one of our pets outside this evening?"<br/><br/>Millicent fainted.<br/><br/><i>[So, her "magic" roll actually failed, and suddenly I saw an opportunity to play around with the time part of the timespace continuum...]</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449948/#Comment_449948" name="Item_164" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-10T05:08:13+00:00" title="December 10, 2015  5:08AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Weren't there two komodo dragons at one point?<br/><br/>"I think the Mouth represents something that is part of us.

Up close, they seemed to be hospital wards of the kind sometimes found in missions in Africa.<br/><br/>As they crept closer, Ruby inched ahead of them. "Wait!" hissed Jimmy as she rounded a corner and came face to face with four large men in hospital orderly uniforms carrying double-barreled shotguns.<br/><br/>"Greetings," one of them said. "Dr. Sirhan has been expecting you."<br/><br/>"Let's not keep her waiting," said Ruby glibly. "Have you seen my friend? She vanished a little while ago?"<br/><br/><i>[Reassurance spend by RP to keep the goons from going "all Island of Dr. Moreau" on her.]</i><br/><br/>"Come with us," the man said. His companion handcuffed her behind her back, and then he and another orderly pushed her forward with their guns, leaving the other two to stand guard.<br/><br/>Jimmy and Geronimo looked at each other, shrugged, and burst out of the foliage with their silenced pistols out. Jimmy put two shots into the base of one of their skulls while Geronimo emptied his clip into the other one.<br/><br/><i>[Both Geronimo and Jimmy have Firearms 8+, giving them Ammo 1 under my house rules; this lets them run out of ammo in order to take multiple attacks, which is what they used here to put down the guards.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Ruby was brought inside the summerhouse and shackled to a chair. A guard sat facing her holding a shotgun.<br/><br/>Dr. Sirhan entered, and motioned for the man to lower the gun. "There's no need for that," she said. "Ruby Fitzgibbons! My German friends have given me a complete dossier on you."<br/><br/>"You're not the first person to tell me that."<br/><br/>"I assume that Mr. Wright and that handsome swarthy gentleman you spend so much time with are around somewhere?"<br/><br/>"They may be. I was more interested in a young friend of mine. Did she drop by?"<br/><br/>"Oh yes. She is very unusual, very...different."<br/><br/>"She's sweet."<br/><br/>"Do you know what we do here?" asked Savitree.<br/><br/>"Komodo dragon breeding farm?"<br/><br/>"No, animal research is just part of our work. Come, let me show you."<br/><br/>Ruby was led through a subterranean passage into one of the long, low, hospital buildings. They emerged in the main ward. Long rows of hospital beds lined each wall, most occupied by smiling Siamese men and women.<br/><br/>"This is the people ward," said Savitree. "Most of the subjects here are my own relatives, who volunteered for research."<br/><br/>"Really?"<br/><br/>"Yes, we have tried many things. I believe you know of our soldier program? Good. We are also interested in the...how can I explain this to a non-scientist? The grafting of occult flesh onto human subjects. We hope that by doing so, we may find a way to combine the heritages. Here is one of our experiments."<br/><br/>An elderly woman smiled at Ruby, who shuddered when she realized the old lady's mouth had been replaced by the hideous Mouth of the Liar.<br/><br/>"Mouth-to-Mouth transplantation is a new innovation," said Savitree, unperturbed. "Mostly we've worked in the transplantation of actual Mouths onto human flesh--that is what we plan to do to your friend, by the way. You however, would probably not be a good candidate."<br/><br/>"Oh? Why is that?"<br/><br/>"I don't think you could live with yourself. Originally I was just going to have you shot in the back of the head and tossed in the bay. Instead, however, I plan to take you to the animal ward. I think you find it most interesting."<br/><br/>"My only question is: do you have any tigers?"<br/><br/>"No, we haven't tried tigers yet. I had a subject in mind, but Thawi was overprotective. Did you have anything to do with his murder, by the way?"<br/><br/>"It's been a busy couple of days."<br/><br/>"I'm sure it has been." Dr. Sirhan turned away slightly, then with practiced grace spun around, sweeping her arm at the back of Ruby's knee. The scalpel she had been concealing in one hand bit deeply into the flesh of the American's leg, and Ruby collapsed in a heap on the floor.<br/><br/>"I've only hurt the one hamstring," said Dr. Sirhan calmly, wiping the blood from her scalpel. "I'd prefer you to remain partially mobile."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449994/#Comment_449994" name="Item_167" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-14T16:52:47+00:00" title="December 14, 2015  4:52PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode X: Ruby, My Dear (Part 12)</b><br/><br/>Millicent woke up shackled to a hospital gurney. A Siamese man in scrubs was washing his hands. Hearing her wake up, he turned around quickly. "Oh, you should not be awake. I'll get the anesthesiologist in here right away. You have nothing to worry about. The surgery has an excellent success rate."<br/><br/>"I have to get away..." muttered Millicent. She concentrated on teleporting again...<br/><br/>And the gurney vanished beneath her. She fell heavily to the floor. The Siamese man fainted and slid to the floor as well.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Sirhan and her guards carried Ruby into the animal ward. A wire cage separated the entryway from the main ward, which was lined with smaller cages. Inside them Ruby saw monkeys with Mouths, cats with Craws, birds without Beaks, and of course the Dragons of Lies. The guards opened the door to the ward, threw Ruby to the ground, and then stepped back and slammed the door behind her.<br/><br/>Through the grillwork Ruby could see Dr. Sirhan studying a large board with many toggle switches on it. "I think...monkeys," she said, and flipped the switch.<br/><br/>A klaxon rang and all the monkey cage doors opened at once.<br/><br/>Geronimo burst through the outside door and leveled his shotgun at Dr. Sirhan. "Close those doors, you bitch," he said.<br/><br/>"I could do that," said Savitree calmly. "But then you will kill me."<br/><br/>From inside the ward, Geronimo, Sirhan, and the guards could hear Ruby suddenly begin to whisper in a sibilant, vowel-filled language--the Tongue of Lies. <i>Spare me</i>, she hissed at the monkeys.<br/><br/><i>She tortures us! Free us!</i> they hissed back.<br/><br/><i>Open the door and she's yours</i>, replied Ruby.<br/><br/>As one, the monkeys sprang onto the wire grille that separated the ward from the outer chamber and began to gnaw their way through the wire.<br/><br/>"Oh boy," said Savitree.<br/><br/>"Open the cage," growled Geronimo. "I have killed before. I am not afraid to slay you."<br/><br/>"Very well," said Savitree. She pressed a large red button and then dropped to the floor under the desk. The gate to the ward sprang open and the monkeys burst into the room.<br/><br/><i>[GP: But they're going to attack her, right?</i><br/><i>Me: Most of them!]</i><br/><br/>Geronimo squeezed both triggers on his shotgun. The mob of monkeys in front of him dissolved in a cloud of fur and blood, but two of them got past the buckshot and leaped onto his shoulders, gnawing furiously.<br/><br/>Ruby popped her belt buckle open and took out the tiny two-shot derringer she kept hidden there. Despite the pain burning like fire up her leg, she was able to get a shot off from prone position and shot one of the monkeys, killing it. Geronimo drew his knife and plunged it into the remaining monkey.<br/><br/>There was a burst of flame and the monkeys who had gone after Savitree yelped horribly as they burned to death. She stood up from under the desk. "I hate doing things like that," she said. "So unscientific."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Jimmy slammed through the front door of the people ward. A guard with a shotgun moved to intercept him. Jimmy shot him in the chest with one barrel of his shotgun, dropping the guard, and then kicked open the double doors to the ward floor itself.<br/><br/>From the operating theater, Millicent peaked into the room and saw Jimmy running toward her...and people climbing out of their beds behind him.<br/><br/>"Mr. Wright, look out!"<br/><br/>Jimmy dropped into the kind of slide that would have made Enos Slaughter nod approvingly and rolled into the operating theater. Millicent pushed the doors closed behind them and they both slid a heavy cabinet in front of the door. The windows in the door shattered as the subjects from the ward smashed their fists into them.<br/><br/>The doors shuddered from the weight of bodies falling against them.<br/><br/>"Millicent! Do that thing!" shouted Jimmy.<br/><br/>"But Mr. Wright, I don't know if I can..."<br/><br/>"Just do it or we're dead!"<br/><br/><i>[So, Millicent spends Cthulhu Mythos to do her Physicists Hate This One Easy Trick With the Spacetime Continuum.

Savitree, with remarkable sang-froid, was reaching for the control panel to open the remaining cages.<br/><br/>Geronimo jumped over the desk and seized her wrist in one vice-like grip. "What are you going to do with me?" whispered Savitree. Geronimo leaned back for a second...<br/><br/>And Savitree dropped them both to the floor in a sacrifice throw. She rolled over Geronimo and raised one hand to strike him.<br/><br/>A shot rang out and she fell to the floor. Ruby flung away the derringer and crawled forward toward Savitree, who was scrambling to get back up. Geronimo cracked her on the wrist with the back of his knife blade.<br/><br/>Jimmy smashed her in the back of the skull with the butt of his shotgun. Blood splattered to the floor and Savitree fell forward, bracing herself against the floor with splayed hands. Millicent kicked her in the face.<br/><br/>"Your friends will die," panted Sirhan. "If you don't put down your weapons now. The blonde girl and the reporter. Do you really think we can't hear the noise of a plane landing in Patthaya? You really are <i>stupid</i> heroes."<br/><br/>Jimmy put Sirhan in a vicious immobilization hold. "Take care of the generators," he hissed at Geronimo. Millicent helped Ruby up and they all staggered outside.<br/><br/>From the heights on the south end of the island a crowd of Europeans had gathered, looking down at them. "Uh, what's the meaning of this?" shouted Daniel Lowman, in his flat American accent.<br/><br/>Jimmy glared at him, and continued dragging Sirhan toward the people ward.<br/><br/>"<i>Freunden</i>," said Lowman, "<i>wir m\xfcssen gehen. Jetzt.</i>" He and several of the Europeans began to move toward the docks. <br/><br/>"The barge is gone!" someone shouted. <br/><br/>Lowman produced a pistol. "There's a motor launch on the other side of the hill," he said. "Unfortunately, many of you are going to need to stay."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>"Where are they," growled Jimmy as he dragged Savitree next to the people ward.<br/><br/>"Why should I tell you? You're going to kill me, aren't you?"<br/><br/>"Pramoj wants you alive," pleaded Millicent. "He's in love with you. We'd like to give you back to him alive. But you're not making this easy!"<br/><br/>"He's not in love me!" retorted Savitree. "Muriel always told me you white devils would end up treating me like this. I didn't want to believe her--I always got on well with Europeans. But I'm swearing off you people right now!"<br/><br/>"We're Americans," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"That's even worse! Very well. You'll find your islander friend and the blonde girl in the basement of the main house. And the reporter...is here in the ward."<br/><br/>"Did you do anything to her!" shouted Jimmy.<br/><br/>"We <i>experimented</i>. Don't worry, she'll recover." Savitree snickered. "You know, we call Siam the <i>land of smiles</i>." Her laughter became maniacal.<br/><br/>Jimmy dropped her to the ground, pulled out his pistol, and shot her in the kneecap. Through the cries of pain, she kept up her pealing laughter.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Jimmy burst into the people ward. Most of the patients were milling around, hissing and drooling Nectar from their mouths...or the Mouths implanted on their bodies. They backed away from him quickly--whatever Millicent had done, they had <i>felt</i> it.<br/><br/>Some of the beds remained occupied with unconscious or sick patients. Jimmy made a beeline for the one with a dark-haired Caucasian woman lying in it.<br/><br/>Janet's eyes fluttered opened, and she smiled at him. "Oh, Jimmy, it was terrible. They came for us in the night...I don't remember too much after that..."<br/><br/>Jimmy said nothing, his eyes fixed on the bandage wrapped around her upper right arm.<br/><br/>"I've had the most horrible dreams," whispered Janet.<br/><br/>"It's all right," Jimmy said.<br/><br/><i>[GP: Shit just got real.</i><br/><i><del>MP</del> RP: Shit got real as soon as we started using Millicent as a subway line.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy picked up Janet and carried her out of the ward. He placed her gently at the foot of a tree and began to walk back toward Ruby, Millicent, and Sirhan.<br/><br/>Ruby saw the look on his face and the pistol in his hand. She hobbled up on the tree branch that she was using as an improvised crutch and moved away wordlessly. Millicent looked at him with a steely indifference.<br/><br/>Jimmy raised his pistol and shot Savitree in the other kneecap. He grabbed her by the back of the neck and dragged her into the animal ward, past the long rows of animal cages, to the back of the ward.<br/><br/>To where the Komodo dragons were kept.<br/><br/>"What..." said Savitree groggily as Jimmy slammed the button that opened the cage. The dragons, hissing from the hideous Maws of the Liar on their face, backed away from him. He threw Savitree inside the cage and slammed the door shut behind him, and then turned and walked slowly back down the length of the ward.<br/><br/>He never once turned back, no matter how loud the blood-curdling screams got.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450035/#Comment_450035" name="Item_170" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-15T18:16:30+00:00" title="December 15, 2015  6:16PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...I said the thing about using Millicent as a subway?

Geronimo had brought Charlie and Betty out from the main house. Betty was leaning heavily on Charlie.<br/><br/>"Am I a real detective yet?" she whispered to Jimmy.<br/><br/>The sound of the motor launch came from the south of the island, leaving them with the sudden realization that they were marooned on the island.<br/><br/>Until they heard the sound of a twin-engine plane approaching.<br/><br/>Limping and carrying their wounded, they made their way to the shore. The <i>Brightening Dawn</i> lowered down on them like a graceful red bird, splashing into the surf and coming to rest a few feet off the beach. The pilot's hatch opened and Joyce stuck her head out.<br/><br/>"I still hate you," she said to Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Glad to see you flying again," he said as he carried Janet through the waves to the plane.<br/><br/>Pramoj helped them up into the main cabin, and soon they were taxing down the river.<br/><br/>"James," said Ruby, "do you want to take a vacation for a couple of days? You're looking a little--"<br/><br/>"Murderous?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"What happened to me," moaned Janet. "Did they do something to my arm?"<br/><br/>"It's going to be okay," he said. <br/><br/>"Where's Savitree?" asked Pramoj as they lifted into the air and began banking around over the island.<br/><br/>"Down there," said Ruby. As if on cue, explosions flared into life beneath them.<br/><br/>"I see you have betrayed my promise."<br/><br/>"<i>I</i> didn't make any promises. She cut my leg."<br/><br/>"I see. Well, we did accomplish something by destroying the Mouth of Bangkok. But I want you to remember something very important, Miss Fitzgibbons. You have offended a demolitions expert."<br/><br/>"I know," she sighed.<br/><br/>"I hope to enjoy a long future correspondence with you," said Pramoj.<br/><br/>Jimmy felt for his gun, but then looked at Janet.<br/><br/><i>[I pointed out that cold-blooded murder would be a four point Stability loss, so Pramoj lived for the moment.]</i><br/><br/>"It was unavoidable," said Ruby. "Do you <i>know</i> what she was doing on the island? The horrors she was creating? Janet, look away."<br/><br/>Ruby began to unwrap the bandage on her arm.<br/><br/>"What's going on?" said Janet, trying to turn her head. Millicent seized it in her hands and held her face to her breast. "What are you doing?" said Janet, her voice muffled. "What's wrong with my arm...what's...where's that <i>voice</i> coming from? Oh God...God <i>help</i> me..."<br/><br/>"That was the least unholy thing happening down there!" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Hide that thing from me," said Pramoj. "I have seen that kind of\u2026injury\u2026before. I am sorry it happened to your friend. If you want to make this up to me, you must destroy the Thing's body."<br/><br/>"We're trying."<br/><br/>"Then I will help. Although I may still try to blow you up later.

It was quiet an in a remote location--a two story clapboard frame house with a breezeway on the first floor, a small boathouse near the shore, and a long pier they kept the <i>Brightening Dawn</i> moored to.<br/><br/>They'd been there for a couple of weeks, licking their wounds after the escape from Siam. Dr. Orange had rejoined them after a nice trip to Paris with Dr. Born. Jimmy spent a lot of his time taking care of Janet, who was psychologically shattered as a result of her horrific experience. Geronimo spent much of his time running along the beach, his shirt off. Ruby liked to watch him from the upper story of the house. One time she caught Dr. Orange doing so as well.<br/><br/>But Millicent was gone.<br/><br/>Jimmy had found the note the day they left Singapore, their first refuge after leaving Siam. She apologized for everything, said it was her fault that Janet had been experimented on and that Ruby had been hamstrung, because of her travels in time. She had left for Switzerland to find an asylum to recover in.<br/><br/>"But my leg is going to be fine," said Ruby. Jimmy shrugged. "She may be safer there, especially if we don't know where she is. But I can have my people look for her."<br/><br/>Privately, he talked to Dr. Orange about trying to "create some kind of imprint in the spacetime continuum."<br/><br/>"<i>Was</i>?" said the Doctor.<br/><br/>"She could be anywhere in space or time."<br/><br/>"What are you talking about? She's a silly little girl, she ran away."<br/><br/>"Haven't you seen all the things she's done?"<br/><br/>"No."<br/><br/>Jimmy sputtered, then grew thoughtful. "That's right...you haven't really seen any of the things she's done."<br/><br/>"<i>Ja</i>, Jimmy, physics and metaphysics are two different things. I mean, I don't speak English that well, but..."<br/><br/>Jimmy sighed and went to his room. He encrypted a message to Millicent and left it on the table. Millicent finding it would be one of the less weird things to have had happened lately. \n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Janet Winston-Rogers wasn't doing well.<br/><br/>When Jimmy broke the news to her about the horrible Mouth that now existed on her arm, she kept a stiff upper lip. During their flight from Bangkok through Singapore and Ceylon, she was withdrawn and quiet but seemed to be keeping it together otherwise.<br/><br/>But now, having time to rest, the macabre nature of her condition was slowly pervading every aspect of her life. The Mouth could be bandaged up, but it would chew through cloth and even leather given enough time. And it talked, a constant stream of quiet, hissing, wordless malevolence.<br/><br/>Sometimes she tried to play the old piano they had in their beach house, playing sad Chopin preludes and nocturnes, at least until the sound of the Mouth drowned out her playing.<br/><br/>Jimmy and Dr. Orange, who both had some psychological training, could recognize the signs of a profound and suicidal depression taking hold in Janet.<br/><br/>Jimmy spent his days researching her condition in his books. He found out that the Liar had the ability to detect things near any image of itself--it seemed this is why Doug Henslowe had kept his journal, with its sketches of the Liar, in a box with a "magic rock." Janet wore that rock around her neck now, but Jimmy wasn't sure if that would work with the Mouth on her arm.<br/><br/>"I need help," sighed Jimmy one day to Ruby.<br/><br/>"What about your friend who possesses people?" she asked.<br/><br/>"He gets in touch with me...not the other way around."<br/><br/>"It doesn't like that rock," said Ruby. "The Mouth screamed when you brought the rock near it."<br/><br/>"Yeah, I had nightmares for a couple of days after that. But maybe that can be useful..."<br/><br/><i>[JP made a Cthulhu Mythos spend here to find out details of the Mouth, and I handed out the idea that the Enchant Item spell might be useful here...]</i><br/><br/>A few days later, several men wearing black turbans arrived at the house. They brought with them a flat, ornately carved wooden box. "This design was most...unusual," said one of them when he gave the box to Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Thanks," said Jimmy. "It's just what I needed."<br/><br/>He opened the box and took out an ornate silver armband. In the center of it, the rock from Doug's box was set, projecting downward so that it was on the side that would be fixed to the arm. The armband had leather padding on the inside as well.<br/><br/>Jimmy took it to Janet's room. She was sleeping fitfully. He fitted it to her upper arm, forcing the rock into the Mouth. There was a choking sound, and then blissful silence.<br/><br/>He finished fastening the armband and quietly left the room. Behind him, Janet rolled over in her sleep and smiled.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450119/#Comment_450119" name="Item_176" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-20T07:44:51+00:00" title="December 20, 2015  7:44AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, this is one of the ones I missed.

The phone rang.<br/><br/>Everyone looked at Jimmy. "Oh no," he said. "I always answer the phone. Someone else get it."<br/><br/>Ruby sighed and picked up the phone. "Hello?"<br/><br/>"Do I have the pleasure of speaking with Miss Ruby Fitzgibbons?" said a man with a husky voice and Mid-Atlantic accent.<br/><br/>"Perhaps. Depends on who's calling."<br/><br/>"This is Montgomery Donovan. Could you put Mr. Wright on? Or do you have an extension? I was hoping to speak to him--I have the utmost respect for him, and indeed what you are all doing."<br/><br/>"James," said Ruby, cupping the receiver with her hand, "Villainy is afoot."<br/><br/>Jimmy sighed and took the phone. "James Wright."<br/><br/>"Ah, Mr. Wright. I understand you've been paying visits to some of my colleagues."<br/><br/>"And?"<br/><br/>"I must say that I admire the panache you've exhibited on those occasions. Losing Savitree was a blow, but her methods had become unsound."<br/><br/>"She brought on her own death."<br/><br/>"I can't disagree with you. And clearly Brooks was always going to be the dull augur in this toolbox."<br/><br/>"Are you going to keep on making words or are you going to tell me what you want?"<br/><br/>"Well, I wished to speak to you as I anticipate you arriving one day on my doorstep. I thought it would behoove me to reach out to you before then. I have nothing but the greatest respect for your abilities and your methods. Your previous activities are not unknown to me, through the circles I move in."<br/><br/>"It's a small world."<br/><br/>"Indeed. I thought I would make this call to give you an opportunity to talk...but primarily to distract you. Good bye, Mr. Wright."<br/><br/>And on cue a smoke grenade crashed through the window and began filling the room with acrid vapor.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>From the upstairs room, Dr. Orange saw two groups of people moving up from the shore and from the south, in the general direction of the boathouse. He picked up his rifle and sighted down it through the scope.<br/><br/>The group coming up from the beach were carrying rifles. Swinging his view around to the south, he saw that group seemed be carrying pistols, except for one man who had a Thompson carried in a tactical sling.<br/><br/>He swung the scope around again and looked at the <i>Brightening Dawn</i>. Someone had opened one of the access panels on the starboard engine. He could see the frayed ends of the ignition wires hanging limply on the wing.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>Downstairs, Betty fished a shotgun out of the corner and threw Geronimo and Jimmy their pistols.<br/><br/>"Get to the lanaille!" shouted Jimmy, pushing everyone into the open breezeway between the two wings of the house. Smoke poured out behind them. Geronimo and Ruby stumbled out and tried to get to the opposite wall to take cover. Betty sprinted out and spun to face the beech, pulling back both hammers on the shotgun.<br/><br/>Jimmy stepped out and felt someone trip him. He landed against the hard concrete and rolled over. A woman dressed in black held a pistol on him. When she spoke, he recognized her by her voice as the woman who had broken into his office in Los Angeles.<br/><br/>"Mr. Wright, I'm arresting you for terrorism against the British Crown," she said.<br/><br/>Geronimo fired a pistol shot at her. She ducked it, fired off a snapshot that Geronimo had to dance away from, and then swiveled the pistol back at Jimmy.<br/><br/>The reports of rifles came from the direction of the beach. Betty shrieked and fell to the ground, bleeding from her leg. Geronimo crawled through the shots to her side. Ruby grunted and ducked back against the wall.<br/><br/><i>[Actually, everyone but Jimmy took damage here, but nobody went negative so it was movie fight damage.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy decided this was his chance and swept a kick at the woman's legs, rolling to his side so he was no longer in weapons line of sight from her. She aimed a kick at his stomach and he grunted in pain.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>From upstairs, Dr. Orange could see the riflemen crouched down behind the low stairs that led up from the beach. The other group was trying to sneak around the side of the house to catch everyone in the breezeway in a crossfire that would undoubtedly kill them all. He carefully aimed and put a round into the head of the man with the Thompson gun, dropping him. The other men flattened themselves against the wall of the house, not willing to move while a sniper had them in his sights.<br/><br/>As the woman set herself to aim another kick at Jimmy, Ruby fired off some shots at her. One of them winged the Englishwoman in the arm, which seemed to make her reconsider her tactical position. She slipped into the house and vanished in the whirling smoke.<br/><br/>"Somebody needs to provide a distraction so that everyone else can get to safety, fetch the spare wires from the tool shed so we can get out of here," said Jimmy. "Cover me."<br/><br/>He grabbed Betty's shotgun and sprinted out of the lanaille towards the riflemen. From behind him he heard Geronimo firing his pistol rapidly, giving him some cover fire. Bullets whinged against the pavement of the walkway as Jimmy pounded down it. He sprang up and landed in the middle of the riflemen.<br/><br/>They stood up with their rifles clubbed. One swung at Jimmy's head. He caught the stock of the rifle with the butt of his shotgun, flipped his gun over quickly, and give the other man both barrels in the face. He ducked under the swing of the second man, spun, and pulled out his .45. He emptied the pistol's entire clip into the man's guts. The final rifleman swung his rifle around to shoot at him, but Jimmy grabbed the barrel and shoved it away, causing the shot to fly harmlessly into the air.<br/><br/>"Think about it," he growled.<br/><br/>"Don't kill me," said the man. He was Indian, and by his carriage Jimmy guessed he was ex-Indian Army.<br/><br/>He flipped the rifle around and bashed the stock into the man's face. He crumpled to the ground.<br/><br/><i>[Geronimo has Firearms 8, and the cherry I give for that is that he always has "Ammo" 1 with any gun with a reasonable magazine. You can spend Ammo to get suppressive fire against a target, so Jimmy only had two men shoot at him. I let JP spend Athletics instead of health here, at 1-to-1; this was to simulate Jimmy's great speed and Athleticism, but that was a bit unfair--my normal rule of thumb for things like this is 2-for-1 or even 3-for-1.

She pulled the door open and plunged into the darkness inside.<br/><br/>She heard the sound of a pistol cocking behind her. She put her arms in the air and slowly turned as the door closed. The Englishwoman regarded her coolly.<br/><br/>"I don't actually have any orders regarding you, Miss Fitzgibbons," she said. "So I suppose I could just execute you and throw your body into the Arabian Sea..."<br/><br/>"I'd prefer you didn't."<br/><br/>"Yes...we'd all like many lovely things."<br/><br/>"I'd imagine you'd like not to be shot."<br/><br/>"It was part of my general plan, yes."<br/><br/>"How's that working out for you," said Ruby, a little smugly.<br/><br/>"I've had better plans, to be honest."<br/><br/>The firing from the beach reached a crescendo. The heavy thud of a shotgun being fired filled the air, followed by the sound of rapid pistol fire.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>"Get Betty and Janet to the plane," shouted Geronimo to Charlie. He dashed out from the breezeway and swept up the Thompson gun from the dead mercenary. (Oh, yes; he had recognized there were professionals at work here.) He could see two men with pistols rush toward the house, covered by a third man who hadn't noticed him yet.<br/><br/>Geronimo thumbed the fire selector on the Thompson to full auto. He sprayed fire in a wide arc at the two men running for the house and the third one covering them from the corner of the breezeway. The man at the corner hit the deck as soon as the gun went off. The two men trying to get into the house both hit the ground, bleeding. They fired their pistols back at Geronimo. He staggered back as a 9mm round smashed into his chest.  He groaned as blackness crept in at the edge of his vision, but he managed to stay on his feet.<br/><br/>Inside the house, Dr. Orange went to the top of the stairs and looked down. The smoke in the parlor was clearing, and he could see that the door to the breezeway had been perforated by .45 ACP slugs. He saw the muzzle flashes as the two men crouched at the door fired back at Geronimo.<br/><br/>He fished into his satchel and pulled out a Great War issue grenade. He carefully examined the staircase, muttering calculations under his breath. Then he smashed the handle off the grenade, counted to three, and rolled it down the stairs. He ducked back into the upstairs room as the grenade detonated at the base of the stairs.<br/><br/><i>[I let OP make a Physics spend here rather than Athletics to put the grenade exactly where he wanted it.]</i><br/><br/>Geronimo was reaching for his pistol when suddenly the door to the house vanished in a flash of light. The concussion knocked him to the ground. When the smoke cleared, he saw nothing of the two men by the door except large splashes of blood.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>"Miss Fitzgibbons, do you think Mr. Wright will allow me to leave if I use you as a shield?" said the Englishwoman.<br/><br/>"No," said Ruby with candor.<br/><br/>"Pity." The woman's pistol barked, and Ruby fell to the ground without a word. Blood pooled under her from the horrible wound in her chest.<br/><br/><i>[Yup. Triple damage here from the pistol put Ruby at -10.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>Jimmy rounded up the rest of them. He helped Charlie put a tourniquet on Betty's leg--she'd been hit far worse than she thought.<br/><br/>"You are bleeding too, Mr. Wright," said Charlie.<br/><br/>"Yeah, Took one in the ribs."<br/><br/>"You have a true warrior nature," said Charlie simply, the way he always did when giving a profound compliment.<br/><br/>Dr. Orange came down and stepped gingerly over the wreckage. He made his way over to Geronimo and braced him against the wall, waving a bottle of smelling salts under his nose. The Spaniard jerked awake.<br/><br/>"Where's Ruby?" he said.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450155/#Comment_450155" name="Item_181" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-23T02:24:24+00:00" title="December 23, 2015  2:24AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Yeah, this fight was quite deliberately tough, in light of my revised thinking about Monty (from "milquetoast administrator" to "Hypercompetent Bond villain".)</blockquote>\nYes.

"Who is it we're contacting again?" asked Geronimo from the backseat where he was holding a compression bandage against Ruby's chest.<br/><br/>"Some friends I made in a branch of the Congress Party," said Dr. Orange, who was driving.<br/><br/>"What branch?"<br/><br/>"A Comintern branch, if you must know. Communists usually have the best underground hospitals, at least they did in Germany. Practice, I guess; they got beat up a lot."<br/><br/>This proved to be the case in India as well; at least, the clinic was good enough to get Ruby out of immediate danger and then provide a secure space for her and the rest of them to recover. <br/><br/>Jimmy found an apartment with a piano that he and Janet could lie low in. He spent his days playing ragtime pieces he'd learned from Freddie Blakely to try and keep her spirits up, although most of the time he could barely get through her cloud of depression.<br/><br/>One day, he packed their bags. "I have a surprise for you," he said. They took a cab to the waterfront and he walked down a wharf to a trim little sailing yacht.<br/><br/>"What's this?" she asked.<br/><br/>"We're going to take a little cruise," he said. "I used to sail a bit when my family would go up to Newport for the summer. I thought...I thought we should just get away from it all."<br/><br/>"Oh." She stood still for a moment, and then clutched him tightly, burying her face in his chest. "Oh, thank you Jimmy."<br/><br/><i>[JP spent a point of XP to pick up Piloting (small watercraft), and then pitched the idea of a cruise which was really, really sweet.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>Our Jimmy and company are a bit worse for wear, don't you think? <br/><br/>I know, you haven't heard from me for a while; but then it's my style to sit back and watch save for the occasional spectacular appearance on the stage. Like a slumming movie star with a bit part in a Broadway play.<br/><br/>Oh, you didn't think I was just the <i>narrator</i>, did you? Not in the slightest. Nor am I the author. Ruby et al authored plenty of things and didn't need the slightest push from me. But that doesn't mean I didn't have a hand in, leaning on a few things here, pushing a few things out of the way there. And when you do it right, it's like arranging dominoes all around the room and kicking them over to reveal a pattern. Hopefully a rude word, if you're me.<br/><br/>All you need to do is push down one little piece of wood...and it all falls into place...\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>And so they flew to Italian East Africa, landing in the part that had once been Eritrea before the Italians had gotten empire-mad again. By this time the war with Abyssinia was mostly over, although like all colonial powers the Italian Fascists were discovering that the highlands were proving hard to hold. They put the <i>Brightening Dawn</i> down in the port of Massua, where they had their first encounter with the wonders of authoritarian bureaucracy, in the form of a port inspector named Carlo Salvatore.<br/><br/>"It is very hot," said Carlo in a weary voice. "Let me see...Bill Parsons, a reporter from Montreal?"<br/><br/>Jimmy smiled and tried to seem polite.<br/><br/>"Hrmm...and Carol Hunt, American...you own a railroad?"<br/><br/>"Yes," said Ruby brightly. "We're trying to build a railroad from here to the Cape."<br/><br/>"That sounds quite difficult, since you will cross the territory of at least three colonial powers. We used to have a small railroad here, to bring the borax in from Dallol. Perhaps it would interest you. Ah, <i>Tenente</i>," said Salvatore, saluting Geronimo.<br/><br/>"<i>Teniente</i> Juan Ricardo, <i>si</i>."<br/><br/>"My cousin is serving in Spain, driving out those horrible Socialists and Communists. Have you heard the latest? The Republic clings to life by a thread. Soon your commander, General Franco, will finish the work of purging the country of subversives."<br/><br/>Swallowing his pride and self-respect in one gooey lump, Geronimo nodded. Salvatore continued, oblivious. "Of course it is difficult to fight there. Such a backward people in the hillier regions like Aragon."<br/><br/>"Yes...I agree with you."<br/><br/>"And finally we come to you, Herr..."<br/><br/>"Hansel Heinzhausen," said Dr. Orange with aplomb, pretending not to notice Ruby giggling at the name. <i>It\u2019s just a name</i>, he thought. <i>I knew a Hansel Heinzhausen at university, and he was a great guy</i>. "I am a geologist, here to study the mineral wealth of the country."<br/><br/>"Yes, our Compagnia Minerale Colonia is attempting to restart the export of the mineral salts from the interior.

Ruby and Dr. Orange managed to talk their way into the local archaeologist's club, where they discovered that through some fortuitous turn of events, Bartolo Acu\xf1a, the head of the 1925 Dallol expedition that had dug near where the First Mouth was rumored to have been. <br/><br/>"He got a job with the Ministry of Antiquities," a waiter told them. "Very proud of himself. Bad tipper. Left with a column of soldiers headed northwest."<br/><br/>Asking around further among the disappointed girlfriends and admirers of the departed soldiers, they found out that the column had been headed for a town called Adua, and had left a couple of weeks ago.<br/><br/>"We need a guide," said Ruby.<br/><br/>But this turned out to be more difficult than they supposed.<br/><br/>All the Europeans had been hired by the Italian Army, draining the available pool. Some advised heading to Mersa Fatma to find a native Abyssinian guide. Jimmy got the distinct impression, however, that the local guides had somehow been warned off of them.<br/><br/>"But we used fake names!" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Fake names don't work against magic," muttered Jimmy.<br/><br/>A day or two later they flew down to Mersa Fatma. In addition to finding a guide, they hoped to call on the CMC to find out what they could about Dallol.<br/><br/>Once upon a time, the area around Dallol's mineral salts had been one of the richest sources of potash in the world...until 1929, when large deposits were discovered in less inaccessible parts of the world. Since then, the once-proud Compagnia Minerale Colonia had been reduced to a skeleton force in town.<br/><br/>Ruby, who had been searching for any contacts of hers, discovered that St. John Wilkinson, one of her father's hunting friends from England, was in town. She went to meet him at his hotel, which, since it was the only European hotel in town, was also her hotel.<br/><br/><i>[Credit Rating spend, of course.]</i><br/><br/>"Ruby, how delighted to see you old girl," said St. John after they had ordered drinks. "But whatever are you doing in <i>Africa</i>?"<br/><br/>"We're a tiny bit interested in the mining operations."<br/><br/>"Your father's finally got you working in the old family business, eh? Well, good luck, though you've more chance of finding a husband here than mineral wealth. Unless the good Captain Murphy is with you..."<br/><br/>"Yes, well," said Ruby, blushing. "You know I'm always interested in new and different landscapes. We've been trying to get together an expedition into the highlands."<br/><br/>"I've been trying to head down that way myself, but there's not much game to be frank. You hear the awful stories--men dying of heatstroke between ten in the morning and noon. Conditions simply <i>frightful</i>, don't you know."<br/><br/>"Savage conditions never frightened me."<br/><br/>"I suppose you could follow the old railway--that's what we planned to do. Nasty conditions, bandits or freedom fighters or whatever they call themselves in the area thick as flies. Been hard getting the permits--such a run around, and oh, so many bribes. I've had to release one of my guides. Said if we didn't leave soon he'd have to head home to his village. But if you're going that way, I suppose I could throw him your way."<br/><br/>"Fantastic. Send him on over."<br/><br/>"Yes, he's a good man, named Simon or something."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>Jimmy went out with a small kid he'd hired as a translator, searching for information on the soldiers and the highlands Dallol was located in. "I know a place," said the boy. "A tea house, a most wonderful place. My cousin runs it, it is the best tea house in the city. I will take you there, sahib?"<br/><br/>"I wasn't looking for tea."<br/><br/>"Then I will take you to the best restaurant in all of Mersa Fatma, my cousin owns it..."<br/><br/>"Actually, I'm looking for a house of pleasure. Best place to meet people..."<br/><br/>"Ah, house of pleasures! I know the best house! Are you looking for the youthful ladies, or the youthful boys?"<br/><br/>"Where would soldiers go?"<br/><br/>"The question is the same, sahib."<br/><br/>"Ladies, then."<br/><br/>"I know the best European brothel in all of Mersa Fatma, my cousin owns it, it is a wonderful place."<br/><br/>This turned out to be a nondescript house on the edge of town, with several quite attractive women in residence. Jimmy turned on his charm and opened his wallet.<br/><br/>"The soldiers don't come here," said one very beautiful young woman. "But my sister in Massua tells me they come through all the time and head upcountry, to battle against the soldiers loyal to the Emperor. The war is lost, but some are stubborn...ah, well. You know men, I am sure."<br/><br/>"Because I am one?"<br/><br/>"Oh, I just assumed...I mean, you came in and only asked questions..."<br/><br/>"I'm secure in my masculinity. Do you know anything about Adua?"<br/><br/>"The Italians conquered it and are removing Abyssinian treasures. There's an obelisk they wish to take back to Rome. I have heard strange rumors, though not from Adua...of course, you must remember that the Afar are liars and cattle thieves. But they say there is evil magic in the highlands of late. I did see one man from that region who was...missing some fingers."<br/><br/>"Do you know where he is?"<br/><br/>"He was a drover, he has long since returned with the cattle he undoubtedly stole.

"Good evening, my name is Simeon. Mr. Wilkinson sent me to see you. You wish to visit the upcountry?"<br/><br/>"Well, first we want to go to Adua," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"That is where the soldiers are."<br/><br/>"We're not interested in the Italian soldiers."<br/><br/>"That is good. They tend to shoot people they do not know."<br/><br/>"Good to know," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Us too," muttered Dr. Orange. "We'll get along famously."<br/><br/>"We have a colleague we wish to call on," continued Ruby, ignoring the German.<br/><br/>"The Spaniard? I had planned to return to my village instead of heading west..."<br/><br/>"We can make it worth your while," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"I do not do everything for money, Mr. Wright," said Simeon.<br/><br/>Everyone paused. "How did you know his name?" said Ruby, menace creeping into her voice.<br/><br/>"I am a dragoman..."<br/><br/>"How did you know <i>that</i> name?"<br/><br/>"I...have a talent," said Simeon with aplomb. "I am humble and I pray to God, and God tells me answers."<br/><br/>"Amen," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Which god?" asked Jimmy.<br/><br/>"There is only one God. It is not permitted to speak the name of the Divine."<br/><br/>"What's his symbol?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>Taken aback, Simeon said, "The cross, of course."<br/><br/>"Oh, you're a Christian."<br/><br/>"The faith of Ethiopia is complex. I believe in Yeshua ben Yosef. You do know there were Jews in Ethiopia for a long time."<br/><br/>"We've just encountered some people from...alternate faiths. Who would do harm to us."<br/><br/>"I know of them. They would harm the whole world, I think."<br/><br/>"Are you aware of a faith that cuts off two fingers?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"The fingers are not important. It is the mutilations that they use in their...worship. A new faith, one that has only existed since the outsider came. The Mexican."<br/><br/>"There's our guy," muttered Jimmy.<br/><br/>"It was over twenty-five years ago," said Simeon, looking at a photo of Echevarr\xeda that Jimmy handed him. "He was interested in our old ways, and the ruins. And he subverted some to his twisted ideas." He paused. "I will take you to Adua...if you are people of good will."<br/><br/>"What can we do to help you?" said Ruby. "You are doing us a great service."<br/><br/>"Are you here to combat He Who Speaks Only Lies? We could use your assistance...we are not as strong as the old days. Very well.

He was obviously entranced by flying, grinning widely as they soared over the Red Sea.<br/><br/>And the day after that, they set out into the bush. <br/><br/>The heat was...indescribable. Choking dust rose up around them, flies bit them whenever they stopped moving, and sweat soaked everything after only a few moments. At one point they managed to avoid an ambush, but all in all the trip was uneventful if unpleasant. After less than a week they reached the Italian Army camp near Adua.<br/><br/>Close up, the Italian Army seemed more formidable than reputation made it. Maybe it was the machine guns mounted on the armored cars that gave them that impression. A patrol led them back to meet the commandant.<br/><br/>"Your travel papers do not cover this region," said the commandant in a bored voice. "This area is under military command."<br/><br/>"We're looking for someone," began Ruby.<br/><br/>"Another Spaniard trying to speak Italian," groused the Colonel. "I've had it up to here with Spaniards who can't speak Italian."<br/><br/>"I'm looking for my countryman," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Ah, <i>il professore</i>. I am sorry you have come, because now there will be witnesses and I was planning on shooting him tomorrow. Since you are here, though, I could overlook your lack of a permit. The fee is only what you would have paid anyway..."<br/><br/>"Shouldn't we Fascist brothers work together?" said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"What do I care about Fascists? I could be sitting under a tree in Napoli, but my father insisted I join the army. I spent four years fighting the Austrians in the freezing cold, and now I have been sent here. To warm up, I guess. But I am glad you are such an ardent Fascist. Tell me, have you learned to speak German yet?"<br/><br/>Geronimo glowered.<br/><br/>The colonel sighed. "Acu\xf1a will be back tomorrow. I'll have you shown to your quarters."<br/><br/>A young private walked them to a tent at the edge of the camp. He pulled Geronimo aside as the rest of them ducked inside it. "Excuse me, <i>signore</i>, but you are fighting with the Nationalist forces in Spain? My brother is currently fighting there with the Condor Legion. Is there anything you can do to help him? He's my baby brother, I don't want him killed in a firefight..."<br/><br/>Geronimo stared at him a long time. "This war has taken its toll on all of us," he said evenly.<br/><br/>"He volunteered to go off and fight the Communists. I told him not to, I said stay home in Milan, it's much better for you. He left his job at the factory..."<br/><br/>"I understand your concern, but you must let him be his own man..."<br/><br/>"Just tell me one thing, <i>Tenante</i>. His cause is just, is it not?"<br/><br/>"All causes founded in faith...are ultimately just."<br/><br/>"Thank you <i>Tenante</i>. I will say a prayer for you tonight. I hope you will say a prayer for my brother."<br/><br/><i>[So I was driving Geronimo's then-Driver of Atonement (and twisting the knife pretty hard), but since Geronimo gave the answers he wished someone had given him, he got back a point of Stability.]</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450241/#Comment_450241" name="Item_189" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-30T19:53:32+00:00" title="December 30, 2015  7:53PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yah, I couldn't have played a character like Geronimo because I lack enough of the historical grounding to feel the pain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450253/#Comment_450253" name="Item_190" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-31T17:31:03+00:00" title="December 31, 2015  5:31PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hrm, interesting that you say that.

I don't like the Austrians. They tried to kill me for four years! Other than that they are a great people. I never fought the Germans. But my brother did, when they came down at the end of the war. Of course, we were running too hard to really see many of them."<br/><br/>A halftrack pulled up outside. Ruby and Jimmy saw some soldiers jump out. "Help us carry <i>il dottore</i>," one shouted. With the help of some other enlisted men, they carried a drunk man into a nearby tent.<br/><br/>"Let's go," said Jimmy to Ruby, Dr. Orange, and Geronimo. They walked over to the tent and squeezed inside. Dr. Acu\xf1a had been unceremoniously dumped face-first on his cot. He was snoring loudly.<br/><br/>Ruby tossed a glass of whisky in his face.<br/><br/>"Aaah! Who's beating me!" shouted Acu\xf1a, coming to with a start. He began firing off a string of obscenities in Madrid-accented Spanish.<br/><br/>"Brother, calm down!" said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"What are you, Aragonese! Stupid peasant! Get your hands off of me, I'm an educated man, a hidalgo! Oh....why is the tent spinning?"<br/><br/>"Just lick your face. Hair of the dog," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"My English is not good...I thought you said, <i>lick yourself</i>? You lick yourself! You go lick your mother!" <br/><br/>Geronimo and Jimmy both spent a moment resisting the urge to pull out their guns.<br/><br/>"What do you want?" said Acu\xf1a blearily. "Are you from the Italian government? It's going to be done on time!"<br/><br/>"We're not from the government," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Then why are you in my tent?"<br/><br/>"We're asking the questions here!" said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"We need to know about Professor Ayers," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>Acu\xf1a fainted. Jimmy shook him back awake.<br/><br/>"Ayers?" mumbled Acu\xf1a. "That was a long time ago, who wants to talk about his disaster!"<br/><br/>"We want to," said Dr. Orange, annoyed.<br/><br/>"What? <i>Yo no hablo alem\xe1n</i>."<br/><br/>Geronimo grabbed him by the lapels. "If you value your life, you'll talk," he hissed in Spanish.<br/><br/><i>[Intimidation spend by GP.]</i><br/><br/>"If I valued my life, I wouldn't be here. My life is over, I have ruined my career multiple times."<br/><br/>"Tell us about Dallol," said Ruby.<br/><br/>Acu\xf1a went green, and then threw up all over the corner of the tent. "Sorry, you said Dallol?"<br/><br/>Jimmy pushed him back down on the bed. "Okay, look, you're all very scary people...except him," he said, pointing at Dr. Orange. "Did you say something? I don't speak German...we came to Dallol, because I had been reading this book. Terrible, strange book, the <i>Revelations of Glaaki</i>. Spoke of strange rites in Ethiopia before the time of Christ. So I came here, told my superiors I was looking at the Axum Empire because my plan was ridiculous. As ridiculous as what you're wearing, my dear. Tan is not your color."<br/><br/>Ruby glared back at him.<br/><br/>"We came to Dallol in July 1925. It was hot," continued Acu\xf1a. "We found the outer walls buried under the earth just where the book had predicted. There was an inner complex as well, with sealed doors. They had complex relief carvings on them, nothing like the other carvings. Maybe even from a different culture, possibly Semitic. Right around then this Ayers arrived from Los Angeles. Said he had been doing his own investigation and heard about our dig. One night we were sharing some wine--dreadful stuff, but it was very hot--he said he was here checking on some things for a friend of his who had visited Ethiopia years before."<br/><br/>"Was his friend's name Echevarr\xeda?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Your Spanish accent is terrible, but that was the name. It was just then, when we were on the edge of discovery, that everything went wrong. Our laborers stopped showing up, and when they did they were very suspicious. The idiots at the CMC no longer were regularly supplying us...bandits attacked...everything went wrong. It wasn't until that winter that we finally penetrated into the center of the complex. It was amazing, that such a thing should exist...do you have anything to drink?"<br/><br/>Ruby handed him her flask.<br/><br/>"American whisky? It's like wasting a good flask...well, not in this case. You have no taste in flasks either. It's not your fault, you're not European, you can't have the sense of style of the native Spaniard. We found the most amazing artifact. If you saw it, you would perhaps not think the hand of man could make it! It was a mouth, made of stone, and flat on the ground...a very large mouth. Absurdly large."<br/><br/>"Do you have any notes?" asked Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Those were mostly destroyed...when the complex was destroyed. Now that we were actually inside the complex, my troubles <i>really</i> began. The CMC forgot we existed. Bandits were attacking all the time. The workers all ran away. So I left for a time and went back to Mersa Fatma. Just when I had gotten enough laborers and supplies to start working again...I thought, well Bartolo, you have gone through so much, but you are a man of science, a superior man, an aristocrat. These peasants cannot stop you. I will return to the site, wrest its secrets from the very earth! And that's when the volcano erupted."<br/><br/>"Volcano?" said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Yes, the region is volcanic, they were all supposed to be extinct but I'm not a geologist. Do you have a geologist? They'd probably be very useful. Everything was destroyed, most of my records, the complex was buried under lava. I have some rubbings from the reliefs, that's all. Ayers would not accept what happened, so he rode back down the railway and I never saw him again. But here, I will sketch out the site for you." <br/><br/>"There's the crater," said Geronimo, pointing at the map.<br/><br/>"Yes, it erupted directly beneath our camp, as if God himself was thumbing his nose at Bartolo Acu\xf1a, a man of royal blood...well, on my mother's grandmother's side. And there's a rumor an ancestor of mine was impregnated by Joseph Bonaparte..."<br/><br/>"Can you tell me more about your colleague, Dr. Ayers?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Colleague? He wasn't an archaeologist, I can tell you that," said Acu\xf1a, leaning over and then falling off his chair. Jimmy helped him back up. "He was an ethnologist or some ridiculous thing like that. He talked to the laborers a lot--very strange, what do they know? They didn't build the site, they're just a bunch of goat-herders."<br/><br/>They finally extracted themselves from the doctor's boozy presence and decided to leave immediately. The Colonel was surprised.<br/><br/>"You know that the bandits are more active at night and you will probably be killed," he said.<br/><br/>"That's all right," said Ruby. "We're willing to take--"<br/><br/>"Oh, I'm sure you are. I'm required to read this disclaimer. Well, <i>signora</i>, I wish you well. I hope you can leave this country soon."<br/><br/>"Perhaps we can all find happiness."<br/><br/>"Yes, there are many things that can make us happy," said the Colonel, clearly daydreaming about a firing squad with a certain Spaniard as guest of honor. "But I have been informed that Il Duce himself wants to see this obelisk in person soon. So I am...I believe there is an American expression for my straits."<br/><br/>"I understand," said Ruby.

Simeon had no problem eluding the bandits, and the drovers had a great deal of respect for him. Ruby noticed that he spoke several languages, and suspected he spoke even more than the ones he acknowledged knowing.<br/><br/>Simeon had efficiently assembled an overland expedition, with just the right number of camels, porters, and drovers. He had discreetly made allowances for the amount of explosives and guns they were bringing. <br/><br/>Before they left they dropped in on the Compagnia Minerale Colonia. The complex was near the port, and proved to be almost deserted, with long rows of warehouses sitting empty and slowly disintegrating in the sun. A total of six employees were all that was left of the once thriving outfit.<br/><br/>Renzo Segni, the Director, met them in his office. "<i>Signora</i>, how nice to meet you, and you, <i>Tenante</i>. And a Canadian, you are always charming. Dr. Heinzhausen, how nice to finally meet you. Your reputation precedes you, of course."<br/><br/>"It does?" said Dr. Orange, taken aback. Jimmy cracked a grin--it was obvious to him the Director was buttering up the German, hoping he had some pull with the Ruhr industrial combines.<br/><br/>"I was very intrigued to read your paper on sedimentary layers and potash extraction," continued Segni. "Those tend to be very dry, if you'll pardon the pun."<br/><br/>Dr. Orange joined Segni's strained laughter.<br/><br/>"What can I tell you about?" said Segni. "The Compagnia is not what it used to be...but one day, now that we have an empire again. Think on it--we are in a region even the Romans could not conquer!"<br/><br/>Dr. Orange tried not to chuckle. Ignoring him, Ruby plunged on. "We heard from a colleague that there was a dig site to the west of here that was also the location of a volcanic eruption. Do you know if the area is still active?"<br/><br/>"Hard for me to say, <i>signora</i>. Even if we hadn't abandoned that region, our relationship with the Afar is not very good. I know that you are a modern woman, so this will sound very demeaning--but it was mostly the troublemaking old women of the tribe. Forgive the insult; pray take another sherry."<br/><br/>"How did they do that?"<br/><br/>"They used their influence to discontent the workers. Nothing that stopped the potash extraction. But the dig was a disaster. That fool Acu\xf1a blamed us, but it was not <i>our</i> fault. When the American showed up, we sent him down to Dallol in the hope he could talk some sense to Acu\xf1a--I have a great respect for the American people. I greatly enjoy your movies, and have toured the oilfields of Texas and California. Your country is amazing. Except for the wine. You'd think California could have good wine, but so far, <i>niente</i>."<br/><br/>"I heard there was a falling out between Acu\xf1a and Ayers?"<br/><br/>"To be honest, I found out that while Acu\xf1a was a drunk, this Ayers was a drug addict. Probably to a synthetic compound, something called <i>nectare</i>. In any case Acu\xf1a would send strange messages--he would demand some equipment one day, then wire to cancel it. The next thing we would know, he would send us an angry telegram demanding to know where the item was! We would tell him that he canceled it, and he would call us liars!"<br/><br/>"What about the eruption?"<br/><br/>"The region is geologically active, although there had been no volcanic eruptions for hundreds of years. Really, I think Dr. Acu\xf1a made his own bad luck. Some people Dame Fortune spits on."<br/><br/>"We ran into Acu\xf1a..."<br/><br/>"I'm so sorry. I understand he's worse."<br/><br/>"...yes. But we haven't found the American. Do you know where he is?"<br/><br/>"No. Probably he was massacred by the Afar, you know how they are."<br/><br/>"We haven't met yet."<br/><br/>"Oh? Do you not have a guide?"<br/><br/>"I see what you mean. Yes, we hired a man from that region."<br/><br/>"Really? Was it Jerome, or Peter, or..."<br/><br/>"Something like that," said Geronimo, trying to avoid letting Segni know who they hired.<br/><br/>"Simeon," said Jimmy, trying to be helpful.<br/><br/>"Simeon? Really?" said Segni. "He must be an old man by now. I remember working with him when I came here in 1910. Perhaps it is his son."<br/><br/><i>[I should note that the guide's name is actually Jerome in the text; I decided to change a bunch of details about him, including his name.]</i><br/><br/>"How old was he when you knew him?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Oh, hard to tell. Maybe his thirties. But please, enjoy the hospitality of the company while you are in town. Let me put my man Sinuhe at your disposal. Mr. Djau, please come in!"<br/><br/>An Egyptian man in a European suit but wearing a fez silently entered the room. He had a grave, emotionless face, but stood quietly and deferentially next to Segni's desk. He was holding an Islamic prayer book in his hands, and wore an ankh around his neck. It was suspended from the tail, not the loop, making it hang upside down, Ruby noted.<br/><br/>"It would be my pleasure to take you anyplace in town," said Djau. "In fact, there is an excellent club that only recently opened up."<br/><br/>"Is it run by your cousin?" said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Sadly not. If it was, I would get a percentage of the gate. Understand, signor, not everyone has a cousin here, but many people receive...what is your charming American word? Kickbacks. Please be my guest tonight. It is called La Piramide Azzurra."<br/><br/>"The Blue Pyramid?" said Jimmy, choking on something.<br/><br/>"Indeed, that is it in English. I must ask one thing. I understand many Americans are extremely devout in their expression of Christianity. Are any of you opposed to gambling?"<br/><br/>"No," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Excellent. It is a casino."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450323/#Comment_450323" name="Item_194" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-05T04:34:04+00:00" title="January  5, 2016  4:34AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, of course that was timed for when I needed to miss the session.

"I haven't had a chance to see anything since we've been here. But is this the sort of thing that Dad was fighting against?" she asked Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Yes. I don't know how much fighting he did, but he was definitely against it."<br/><br/>"Part of the reason I've been so down is that...I was so terrible to him for so many years. But now I understand how it could mark a man like that."<br/><br/>"We can't help what we know, until we know about it."<br/><br/>"That's pretty wise, Jimmy."<br/><br/>"Take it from somebody who didn't know anything," he said, with a smile.<br/><br/><i>[Me: No wonder she's in love with him!]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>Jimmy decided to get Janet some flowers. "Ah, I know the best florist, he's my cousin!" said one of his guides.<br/><br/>"Let's be honest, he's not your cousin, right?"<br/><br/>"Ah. Well, yes, I can get you overpriced flowers from a man who beats me if I don't bring him customers. He will keep a large percentage of the take and give me a pittance, but at least he will not beat me. Are you happier now that we are being honest?"<br/><br/>Jimmy gave him a large tip. "Wow, now my mom can really have that operation!" the kid said.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>They got dressed to go out. Jimmy, the doctor, and Geronimo wore white dinner jackets, and Ruby finally got to wear one of the several ruby-colored evening dresses she had packed but not worn since...the Yucat\xe1n.<br/><br/>The Blue Pyramid was a modest, low building on the edge of town. Inside, however, it looked like it could have been dropped in the desert from Monte Carlo. A louche young woman in a sequined, low-cut dress and clutching a cigarette holder met them at the front. "<i>Bon soir</i>," she said in a bored tone of voice. She had a thick French accent. "My name is Hippolite. You are expected. You are here to gamble, yes? You'll want to go to the Faro tables."<br/><br/>They followed her past several betting tables surrounded by crowds of well-dressed people from all corners of the globe. Each one had a different color scheme--the baize of the table, the clothes of the dealer, even the backs of the cards were all the same color. They past a white table, a blue table, a green table, and finally stopped at a table draped in black.<br/><br/>"Here is your table," said Hippolite. "The table of the Black Faro."<br/><br/>Keeping with the theme, the dealer was bald, with a heavily waxed goatee that stuck out like the false beards of the Egyptian pharaohs. His eyes were heavily rimmed in kohl, with the edges traced out to remind one of the eye of Horus.<br/><br/>Jimmy was about to follow the rest of them, but Hippolite stopped him. "No, Mr. Wright. My employer would like to speak to you at the bar. It has been, as we say, a very long time, hasn't it Jimmy?"<br/><br/>Jimmy made a small squealing noise.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>"Ladies and gentlemen," said the Faro dealer. "I will take your bets."<br/><br/>"What can we wager?" asked Ruby.<br/><br/>"We deal in all types of information. I am considered a messenger, after all."<br/><br/><i>[RP: this is so cool, we have to do it!</i><br/><i>Me: Take back two points of Stability.</i><br/><br/><i>However, the rest of the group was a lot less gung-ho about this, and the scene ended up falling fairly flat. So I'm doctoring things a bit to make it flow with how I tried to fix it later.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>Jimmy sat down on one of the bar stools. Behind the bar stood a rather blousy-looking woman in a black dress several decades out of style. She put down the newspaper she was reading and slid down to Jimmy. "What'll it be, love?" she said in a Cockney-tinged accent. "Waiting for someone? A lady perhaps?"<br/><br/>"In a manner of speaking. Whisky."<br/><br/>"We're all waiting for someone," said the bartender, pouring two shots. "If you don't mind, I'll join you. Yer 'ealth." <br/><br/>They drank in silence. The bartender carefully put down her glass. "You seem a rather strange lot to come into this country. Whadd'ye, Canadian? I can tell by the accent, dead give away. That your lady over there?" she said, pointing at Janet.<br/><br/>"Yeah."<br/><br/>"What 'appened to her arm? Accident? The armband looks Indian, very posh. So what are you 'ere for, love?"<br/><br/>"Do you run this place?"<br/><br/>"Run? Oh no. Place is too big for me to run. I just tend bar 'ere."<br/><br/>"Who does?"<br/><br/>"Well, what's ownership, anyway, especially a country like this, it's all obligations. And we all," she said, not menacingly at all, "have to pay our debts, don't we?"\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>"There are many things we can offer," said the dealer. "A moment in time. A moment in time wagered. A moment that could perhaps...be altered. Perhaps a theory that has eluded science."<br/><br/>He put an index card face down on the table. Dr. Orange pointedly ignored it.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>"What's your story, love?" said the bartender to Jimmy. "Come, I'll tell you mine. Poor girl comes to Africa, tries to make 'er way, does a few things 'ere and there, some savory, some not. But we all 'ave our history, don't we?"<br/><br/>"We do all have history. Jimmy," he said, holding out his hand.<br/><br/>"Jimmy, eh? Very straight-up of you, ain't it. Me, I came 'ere because of bad luck. But I think duty is much better. Taking care of your girls, taking care of your friends. You a soldier?"<br/><br/><i>[Veiled reference to the change in Jimmy's drive from Bad Luck in Masks to Duty in EL.]</i><br/><br/>"No."<br/><br/>"Good, good. 'Ard to be a soldier, give orders to make people do what they don't want to do. Much better to be independent, right?"\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>"Ruby, please stop," said Geronimo. "It's not worth it."<br/><br/>"Would the gentleman care to make some stakes?" said the dealer. "I assure you, nothing will endanger your soul, Mr. Cuevas."<br/><br/>"You don't have to, Geronimo," said Ruby. "But nothing we do here is any different from what we've been doing the past six months."<br/><br/>"That's not true. You have not done the sort of things I have done."<br/><br/>"Are you sure? You seem to share a very strange bond," said the dealer. Ruby realized that Geronimo had been clutching her arm. Neither of them had noticed.<br/><br/>"If you could change any moment in your life," said the dealer, staring at Geronimo, "Would you not take it?"<br/><br/>Dr. Orange stared in a way he hoped was menacing. He slowly reached towards the pistol concealed under his jacket.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450369/#Comment_450369" name="Item_197" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-06T06:29:10+00:00" title="January  6, 2016  6:29AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm.

You look like a man who travels the world. Could 'appen, right? You can trust me, I ain't going to say anything."<br/><br/>"No."<br/><br/>"Shame. I 'ad a daughter once. Lost 'er though. There was a war."<br/><br/>"My condolences."<br/><br/>"Well, you 'ave to move on. Find something new. New toy, new obsession. I 'ear that's what men do when they reach a certain age. Think they can relive the glory of their past youth. Sometimes it works, I suppose, but sometimes it's just pathetic."<br/><br/>"That would be a mistake."<br/><br/>"Life's a series of mistakes, innit?"<br/><br/>"You just have to hope to make the right one."<br/><br/>Hippolite came up to the bar. "Jimmy--oh. I see you and the boss are already talking."<br/><br/>The bartender leaned closer to Jimmy. He hoped it was his imagination that seemed to make the room grow darker, to make the bartender take on an air of timeless malice and cold amusement. "Sorry, Jimmy. Now. You want to tell me where she is? Your, <i>professional</i> opinion?"<br/><br/>"Well, I don't know where she is."<br/><br/>"Fair enough. I mean, I don't fault you really. I enjoy it when monkeys are clever. Rather a lot. And you're a very, very clever monkey. Too clever for you own good, <i>don't you think</i>?"<br/><br/>"I'm not really that clever."<br/><br/>"I mean, yeah, I do owe you <i>something</i>, for screwing up me plans. On the other 'and, I have lots of plans. When you're a transcendental being beyond time and space, you gain a certain perspective. What about this lot over there, at the wagering tables?"<br/><br/>"They have their choices to make."<br/><br/>"Oh, you all do. Well, first let's make this all go away."<br/><br/>The casino vanished around them. They were standing on a volcanic mountain in a desert. Even though it was night, the heat smacked them all like a physical blow, leaving Dr. Orange to guess they were still in Ethiopia.<br/><br/>Jimmy glanced up at the brilliant sky. His stomach churned as he realized that the stars were wrong. Polaris wasn't the pole star--as near as he could make out, it was a star in the constellation of the Dragon.<br/><br/>Which meant they were at least five thousand years in the past.<br/><br/><i>[Astronomy use by JP.]</i><br/><br/>"We're back where I like it the most," said the bartender. "Not Egypt, of course, but near enough. Let's offer you some gifts. I can be a generous Pharaoh, can't I? Though I do 'ave a reputation to uphold, so there may be a few strings attached." She looked them over with a grim air of appraisement. "Well, Ruby. You 'ave so much on your mind. I can tell you were thinking of wagering a moment of your life, eh? 'Owabout this. I'll give you some extra time. Five minutes that you can redo, change from \u2018ow they went the first time. Any five minutes anywhere, so long as they occur inside the span of your life. And a hint: you're worried about where the First Mouth was, but you should be more worried about the Last Mouth."<br/><br/>Ruby broke out into a sweat. The Messenger, the Black Pharaoh, turned to Geronimo. "Warrior of God, eh? Always so worried about what might stain your precious soul. So 'eres my gift to you. You can say No to something that happens you. Once. Just once. Even if you were to die. Price to be named later."<br/><br/>She turned away for a while. "The doctor we couldn't even tempt. Not even for a moment alone with Geronimo, or the grand unified theory. Oh, you monkeys! And your precious integrity! Ruins my image of you as a breed! I mean, Ruby I can tempt with a naked Geronimo...as well. Interesting."<br/><br/>She put her face in her hands. "I question my fate sometimes," she said. "I could 'ave 'ad the fish people, but no, I got the monkeys. Do you know I can't even get a decent fight in your dreamlands. I mean really, Nodens? The only thing he can do is grow a beard, but you monkeys think that makes him wise somehow."<br/><br/>She glanced back over her shoulder at their uncomprehending faces. "Sorry, office politics, pay no mind," she said.<br/><br/>Turning around, she came face to face with Jimmy. "Now, you I should hurt. You bollocked up things for me something fierce. I sent all my best monkeys after you, and you killed them all. That leaves a mark. But on the other 'and, you are fighting against someone I don't like. I 'ave a brand to protect, and I don't like it when people go around blabbing that they're me when they're not. You wouldn't like it if there was some fake Jimmy running around the world? So, I can suspend 'ostilities for the moment. Though...if you keep going, you may find the cure worse than the disease."<br/><br/>"Maybe <i>you</i> think so," said Jimmy. "We see it differently."<br/><br/>"Fair enough. I 'ave been known to tell a fib or two. Though I've played it pretty straight with you, Jimmy, 'aven't I? So, Pax Nyarlathopteca, until you are finished. Then you and I will have some words about me daughter."<br/><br/>"I don't know much about it."<br/><br/>"You are going to see her again. And when you do...know that I'll be able to see her soon enough. Don't think a monkey can outsmart me forever, Jimmy."<br/><br/>She seemed to grow larger somehow, without gaining in size. The night became even darker, and the stars blazed up with a cruel light. "Monkeys with integrity! Standing up on your 'ind legs so big and bold! Still, you deserve an hint. At the end, you'll go back to the beginning. Was that cryptic? It's 'ard for me to tell, I 'ave to use so many filters to get down to your level. We'll meet again...another time."<br/><br/>The wind swirled around them, and the stars grew unbearably bright. "Don't worry," they heard a voice calling from the storm. "It's not like your lives could get more insignificant...wait, they could! That's what I love about you monkeys! There's never a bottom with you!"<br/><br/>Darkness swallowed them. A horrific roaring sounded in their ears, and they felt their bodies stretching to the point of flying apart like rubber bands. Slowly, a light grew around them, until with a start they found themselves standing in their hotel room.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt

Outside, through the bars over the window, was a spectacular view of an Alpine valley, all falls of ice from glaciers and stands of dark pine trees. She liked her snug, well-appointed...well, cell, maybe, but it hardly felt like imprisonment, even if she rarely felt the need to leave.<br/><br/>The doctors, who were a mostly interchangeable mass of young men who spoke breathless English and rapid German, all assured her she was recovering very nicely. Certainly she felt rested, and more at peace with herself; almost rooted to this place.<br/><br/>From the hallway outside the heavy iron door came the sound of some kind of trolley being pushed down the hallway. "Would you like any tea?" called out a woman with a Cockney accent.<br/><br/>Millicent put down her book. <i>This has never happened</i>, she thought. <i>It's a break in pattern, and Uncle Jack always said to look for those</i>. "No thank you," she said.<br/><br/>"All right, love. If you need anything just call on Nursie. I'm sure I'll be able to see you...soon enough."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>"What do you mean they're all hired? There are no porters in all of Eritrea?" demanded Ruby.<br/><br/>"None of any quality," said Simeon. "The best ones are unavailable, and those that are left are brigands and thieves."<br/><br/>Ruby, Geronimo, and Dr. Orange were in their hotel suite in Mersa Fatma, trying to deal with the latest setback. Without reliable porters, they'd have no chance to make their way into the Afar highlands.<br/><br/>Jimmy was not with them. After their experience in the casino, he had left with Janet for the Greek isles. He had sent word that they were enjoying themselves at a nice seaside villa, taking daily cruises in a little sailboat. Somehow that telegram had seemed to raise the temperature in Eritrea by at least ten degrees for the rest of them.<br/><br/>"Is there anywhere else we can go for porters?" said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"I do not know. Perhaps we can find another expedition and negotiate for the release of some porters."<br/><br/>"Let's try and find them," said Dr. Orange.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>"Yes, the archaeologist hired them all," said Farouk, an Algerian who worked in one of the souks. Dr. Orange bought another coffee from him and they sat down at a little cafe table on the edge of the square.<br/><br/>"The Spaniard?" said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"No, the Frenchman."<br/><br/>"Wait...not Professor Luc Fauche?"<br/><br/>"Yes, that is the one. He has hired every porter he can find."<br/><br/><i>[Streetwise use by the Doc.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Millicent sat in her room, reading. The sun had set but the alpenglow still lit up the peaks surrounding the valley. <br/><br/>A strange whispering sound was coming from the corner of the room. She glanced in that direction, but saw nothing that could be making the noise.<br/><br/>She closed her eyes and tried to turn back to her book, but the whispering noise got louder and louder until she could finally distinguish words in a crisp British accent: "Can you--can you see me? Millicent! Can you see me?"<br/><br/>Much to her surprise, a rather prim, elderly woman suddenly materialized in the corner. She dropped her book, screamed, and pulled back into a corner of the room.<br/><br/>"Don't be afraid, Millicent. My name is Gwendolyn, and I'm here to help."<br/><br/>"All right," said Millicent to herself. "I've gone insane, and this is all part of my insanity."<br/><br/>"No!" said Gwendolyn. "This all around, this is your insanity! Millicent, where do you think you are?"<br/><br/>"Switzerland."<br/><br/>"You're not in Switzerland."<br/><br/>"Ok, fragment of my imagination, where am I?"<br/><br/>"I don't know. I think you may be dreaming it all."<br/><br/>"Well, I'll just wake up."<br/><br/>"You may not wake up from a dream like this, without knowing you're dreaming. You see...you're not so much <i>dreaming</i> as <i>inside dreams</i>." <br/><br/>"Dr. Jung explained this to me, this is the collective unconsciousness, right?"<br/><br/>"Maybe. It doesn't matter. You need to get out of here, or they'll probably find you. There are things in the dreams, Millicent. There are nightmares."<br/><br/>"And you're a thing in the dreams?"<br/><br/>"No, I'm a perfectly normal elderly English lady. Well...perhaps not perfectly normal."<br/><br/>"Are you a member of Epsilon Sigma? That weird sorority?"<br/><br/>"Not a member, no."<br/><br/>"You run it?"<br/><br/>"Heavens no. I'm someone who's had far too much experience with dreaming."<br/><br/>"So I should look you up in England?"<br/><br/>"It's not so simple. First you have to leave."<br/><br/>"Does this place follow the rules of the real world, or of dreams."<br/><br/>"Dream logic, I'm afraid."<br/><br/>"So I could just make that wall disappear?"<br/><br/>"Perhaps...but have you ever tried to?"<br/><br/>"No! I thought I was in Switzerland. So should I try to get rid of this wall, or pick the lock?"<br/><br/>"Whichever you think is easier."<br/><br/>"The lock, then."<br/><br/>"Very well. If we had more time I would teach you to fly."<br/><br/>Millicent fiddled with the lock for a minute. Finally she pulled the door open...<br/><br/>...and they were not in Switzerland any more. They were in the middle of a flat, featureless plain.<br/><br/>"You seem to have reached some base state of your dreams," said Gwendolyn. She looked nervously over her shoulder. "We have to go before they find me.

That alone had been an accomplishment; the sticky, dusty heat of Mersa Fatma was not improved by sleeping under mosquito netting.<br/><br/>In her dream, Charlie appeared. "Miss Ruby. It is time."<br/><br/>"Let us do this then," she said, rising--in the dream--from her sleep.<br/><br/>"You are aware that your friend has been with us all this time, right?"<br/><br/>"Yes. Only in the dream, of course. That's why I don't remember it in waking life."<br/><br/>They came walking across a featureless plain and approached Millicent and Gwendolyn. Millicent saw their dreamforms: Charlie dressed as a Polynesian bridegroom, holding the spear of a chieftain; Ruby's appearance kept changing from glamorous style to glamorous style, looking like she had stepped out of a movie poster each time.<br/><br/>Charlie lowered his spear and pointed it at Gwendolyn. "Get away from her," he snarled.<br/><br/>"Who is she?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"I don't know, but she is hunted."<br/><br/>"She helped me leave what I thought was Switzerland," said Millicent miserably. "But this isn't Switzerland either, is it?"<br/><br/>"No, Millicent, it isn't. But now we're going to be the ones who help you," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"I had better leave anyway," said Gwendolyn. "Before the <i>imp</i> finds me."<br/><br/>"I can try to find you after I get out of this," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"My name's Gwendolyn Darling," she said, and vanished.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>...and much to her surprise, Millicent found herself standing on a wharf. The air was hot and dry. Dockworkers bustled around her, speaking Arabic or Italian or languages she couldn't place.<br/><br/>At the end of the dock she saw Dr. Dreamy Eyes...er, Fauche. He was wearing a natty white gabardine summer suit. With him was Jeanne-Marie Forgeron, his research assistant, a young redheaded woman in her 20s that Millicent didn't recognize (although there was something familiar about her), and Evelyn O'Connell.<br/><br/>"Ah, Millicent. We got your telegram saying you would arrive today," said Dr. Fauche, coming up to kiss her hand.<br/><br/>"I sent a telegram?" said Millicent, taken aback.<br/><br/>"Of course," said Jeanne-Marie in a bored tone of voice, handing the flimsy to Millicent. ARRIVE TODAY MERSA FATMA.<br/><br/>"I sent a telegram," said Millicent, stunned.<br/><br/>"And this is Miss Annette Drew, she is here as a supporter of our work," continued Dr. Fauche.<br/><br/>"Pleased to meet you," said Annette, sticking her hand out in a very American manner.<br/><br/>"And this is Mrs. O'Connell--" said Dr. Fauche.<br/><br/>"We've met, I think," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Yes," said Evelyn. "When you mentioned Dr. Fauche, I was so intrigued that I just had to look him up again."<br/><br/>"Glad you did," said Millicent, head spinning.<br/><br/>"Do you have a hotel? If not, come with us, we have a lovely little French place."<br/><br/>"Sounds wonderful," said Millicent.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Later that afternoon, Ruby was hanging out at the Archaeologist's Club when a man in an immaculate ice-cream suit came in. She heard him speaking French and so drifted over to talk to him.<br/><br/>One of the Italians hailed her. "Miss Fitzgibbons, this is my good friend Luc! Ruby, meet Dr. Fo-Kay!"<br/><br/>"<i>Fauche</i>," muttered Luc. "I keep telling you..."<br/><br/>"Ruby Fitzgibbons," said Ruby, holding out her hand. Dr. Fauche kissed it. "<i>Quelle charmante Americaine</i>," he said.<br/><br/>"Yes, yes. I'm heading out towards Dallol on an expedition..."<br/><br/>"Really? I am headed there too. I believe there are some Axum ruins there, which would be unusually far from their normal regions. That hack Acuna is already working on one of their stelae. Have you ever had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Acuna?"<br/><br/>"Yes, we've met."<br/><br/>"I'm so very sorry to hear that. Please, let me buy you a glass of wine to help you forget...if there's any left in the country after Dr. Acuna has been here. The wine here is Italian, but it's probably drinkable anyway."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>After some wine and small talk, Ruby raised the possibility of joining Dr. Fauche's expedition.<br/><br/>"I am already taking some of my backers with me," he mused. "If you were perhaps to defray the extra expense..."<br/><br/>"Of course, we would be happy to."<br/><br/>"Where in America did you say you were from?"<br/><br/>"Los Angeles."<br/><br/>"I had the pleasure of going to Los Angeles recently. How interesting our paths should cross...especially since you are the second American I have had the pleasure of talking to today, although you are definitely the more beautiful of the two."<br/><br/>"Oh? Who is the other?"<br/><br/>"A young lady from a school that I teach at. A little bookish and serious, good student."<br/><br/><i>A young woman arrives in country dripping with strangeness--it has to be Millicent</i>, thought Ruby. Aloud, she said, "I know a young woman like that. Very precocious, named Millicent."<br/><br/>"Not Millicent Lowell?"<br/><br/>"Yes, that's her."<br/><br/>"<i>Quelle coincidence</i>, that is the girl herself. She is staying with us at the Hotel Palais Royal."<br/><br/>"Wonderful. When do you plan on starting off in country?"<br/><br/>"Now that we are all here, we plan to leave tomorrow. Do you have a guide?"<br/><br/>"Yes, a man named Simeon."<br/><br/>"He is a very interesting man. I have never been able to hire him myself."<br/><br/>"I have certain charms."<br/><br/>"<i>Beaucoup des charmes,</i>" said Fauche graciously. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450766/#Comment_450766" name="Item_204" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-20T16:35:09+00:00" title="January 20, 2016  4:35PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 20, 2016 4:38PM by Aviatrix.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XII: Who By High Ordeal (Part 3)</b><br/><br/>Millicent was staying in the same room as Annette Drew, the young American woman working with Dr. Fauche. She eyed her nervously for a long time before blurting out, "Are you in the Epsilon Sigma sorority?"<br/><br/>"Well, I never went to college," said Annette. "So I'm not in a sorority. I'm in the parent organization, the SSS."<br/><br/>"You're from England?"<br/><br/>"Oh, they have chapters everywhere," said Annette. She went back to reading <i>Women and Men.</i> "This isn't as good as <i>Lady Chatterly's Lover</i>," she said. "Have you read that? You look like the type that might enjoy it."<br/><br/>"I have," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"That's good. I was hoping you would."<br/><br/>There was a rather florid knocking on the door. "I didn't know Ruby was here!" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Ruby?" said Annette.<br/><br/>"She's a friend of mine." Millicent pulled open the door. Ruby was standing there in an elegant summer dress, cigarette holder clutched in one hand.<br/><br/>"You look marvelous!" said Millicent. "This is Annette."<br/><br/>"Charmed," said Ruby. "Are you coming on the expedition?"<br/><br/>"Oh yes," said Annette.<br/><br/>"We were wondering what to read after <i>Lady Chatterly</i>," said Millicent. "What do you recommend?"<br/><br/>"I'm not sure. I tried reading <i>Ulysses</i>, but if that's pornography, I don't know what pornography is."<br/><br/>"Millicent, why don't you join us for dinner," said Ruby. "A wonderful place someone's cousin recommended."<br/><br/>"We should be back early, to get an early start before the heat gets up."<br/><br/>"We have a day. It's not like it's our first romp in the jungle."<br/><br/>"I don't think they have jungles here."<br/><br/>"They don't have <i>shade</i> here," muttered Annette.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>"How did you get here, Millicent?" demanded Ruby. "Please tell me it was a plane or boat. These are the words I want to hear from your mouth: <i>plane</i> or <i>boat</i>."<br/><br/>"I suppose it could have been," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Oh, my."<br/><br/>"The point is she is safe," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Is she here?"<br/><br/>"Unless I'm still dreaming," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Let's test," said Dr. Orange. "What's your favorite color?"<br/><br/>"I don't have one."<br/><br/>"Aha! Wait, what was Millicent's favorite color?"<br/><br/>"You're a fine <i>scientist</i>," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"I thought I was in a hospital in Switzerland but it turned out I wasn't," said Millicent. "Then you were in my dream--"<br/><br/>"Let me guess, big expanse of nothing and you saw a man and woman?"<br/><br/>"Yes. And Gwendolyn said I needed to wake up--"<br/><br/>"Who?" said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"The woman in my dream."<br/><br/>"Oh, of course."<br/><br/>"Like that's the strangest thing you've heard this week," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Perhaps she <i>should</i> go to an institution," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"I think us watching her is safer than her being on her own," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"And then someone was looking for me and I didn't want them to find me...in my dream, I mean, if it was a dream," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Who was looking for you?" said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"I don't know, but if they were looking for me specifically it didn't seem like a good idea for them to find me."<br/><br/>"We'll find out how that happened later on," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"And I'm staying with one of the women who has been searching our rooms!" blurted Millicent.<br/><br/>"How do you know that?" said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"Call it a hunch."<br/><br/>"Is it a...magical hunch?"<br/><br/>"No, no...she has some of the books they left me."<br/><br/>"Let's toss her rooms," said Ruby. "I don't even want to look for anything, I just want it to stick in her craw."<br/><br/>"Wait," said Millicent. "Does she know where your room is?"<br/><br/>"Probably," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Which one? The decoy room or the real one?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"I don't know! How many are we keeping these days?" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"I think three."<br/><br/>"We should just let them toss our rooms if they want. It would save us money."<br/><br/>"I don't want my room tossed! I'm sick of this! Let's toss their room!"<br/><br/>"And the woman who distracted me in the Yucatan is here too. So I don't know how many people here are involved, and that includes Professor Dreamy Eyes...I mean Professor Fauche." <br/><br/>Ruby thought back to her meeting with Fauche. "He didn't seem to be...obviously evil."<br/><br/><i>[Retroactive Assess Honesty use by RP.]</i><br/><br/>"We should go on the expedition," said Geronimo. "We will keep our eyes open."<br/><br/>"And toss her room," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Why should we even do it?"<br/><br/>"Petty revenge! We should send hired goons!"<br/><br/>"I will find us hired goons!" said Dr. Orange. "I'm sure there's plenty of folks who are used to working for Germans around here!"\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>When Millicent returned to her room, it had been tossed thoroughly. Annette was standing in the middle of the room. "I went out for a drink with Evelyn and when I came back it was like this," she said.<br/><br/>"This always happens when I rent a room," said Millicent sadly. "I shouldn't have stayed here."<br/><br/>They spent the rest of the evening cleaning the place up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450801/#Comment_450801" name="Item_205" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-21T15:55:21+00:00" title="January 21, 2016  3:55PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XII: Who By High Ordeal (Part 4)</b><br/><br/>The next day, right before she left to meet the expedition party, Ruby was accosted by an angry Eritrean man. "You!" he spat. "You are the one with the German! Find him for me! He hired our men, and now they are dead!"<br/><br/>"I'm a bit confused," said Ruby, taken aback.<br/><br/>"You find him. Tell him we are looking for him."<br/><br/>Ruby sidled up to Dr. Orange as they saw to saddling their horses. "Some men are dead," she said.<br/><br/>"Don't worry, we won't be coming back here. We'll be magically transformed, or transported somewhere."<br/><br/>Unnerved by the results of her plans and the doc's callousness, Ruby couldn't help but feel eyes on her back the whole time they rode out of Mersa Fatma.<br/><br/><i>[1-point Stability loss for all involved in the plot. This is a bit of a close call here--I didn't want to slap down the players for having a bit of fun--but on the other hand it was a golden opportunity to foreshadow some of the deadliness I had planned.</i><br/><br/><i>That said, 1 point isn't a lot, there were folks with Psychoanalysis in the party, and most people were hitting their drives/statements.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>The expedition was mostly mounted, on horses and camels. There was a touring car driven by a foul-mouthed American woman named Marian, but only Dr. Fauche and Evelyn O'Connor rode in it. Millicent was on a camel, trotting next to Annette.<br/><br/><i>[If Jimmy had been around, he might have recognized Marian Ravenwood...but he was in Greece.]</i><br/><br/>"Should I call you Annie, or--"<br/><br/>"Annette, or Ann, or whatever, just not Nancy. I hate that name!"<br/><br/>If they had thought the trip to Adua had been horrible, nothing prepared them for the heat of the journey into the highlands. They crawled across the anvil of the forge of an angry God, and he brought the hammer down on them.<br/><br/>Geronimo looked natty in long cotton pants, a button-up shirt open to third button, and hair that somehow still looked sexy even when drenched in sweat. Ruby rode behind him, a parasol fixed to her camel's saddle, gradually making her name less a designation and more a description of her skin tone. Dr. Orange merely pondered why he had thought being killed by the SA was a worse fate than this.<br/><br/>"This is awful," Charlie said to Ruby. "But I have been in deserts before. The Captain and I spent some time lost in the Australian Outback."<br/><br/>Ruby nodded deliriously. She told him about the dream that had starred Millicent.<br/><br/>"Ah yes," he said. "I dreamed I had a dream. Congratulations. You've taken your first step into a larger world."<br/><br/><i>[There's a mechanic in the EL book to cover the gradual accumulation of Heat. It mostly hit Ruby the hardest, but really didn't come much into play.]</i><br/><br/>They followed the old rail line for the most part, across the rocky desert. "We could have ridden in the shade, if we had fixed the train!" said Dr. Orange. "And then we could have shot buffalo from it!"<br/><br/>"How's that?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"I'm a cowboy!"<br/><br/>"Ooookay, doc, I think you're hallucinating..."<br/><br/>"Bang, bang, Wyatt Earp!"<br/><br/>"Oh, you knew him too? Nice man."<br/><br/><i>[Died 1929, so possible.]</i><br/><br/>After a few days Simeon rode up to Geronimo. "We are approaching my home village," he said. "I have watched you for a while. I think you are a warrior of God. Would you like to meet some other warriors of God? I think your cause and theirs align."<br/><br/>"It would be an honor."<br/><br/><i>[Geronimo's Drive statement is: I stand between the wolves and the flock, so a point of Stability winged his way.]</i><br/><br/>As they rode into the village of Kolluli, several children ran out to greet them. Millicent greeted them in halting Afar--she had been trying to pick up some from the drovers, and the children of the other villages they had ridden through.<br/><br/>The rest spurred on to the village, where there was shade and fresh water. Ruby managed to stagger into the hut Simeon led her to before collapsing.<br/><br/>By the evening they were mostly feeling better enough to walk around the edge of the village, looking at the fabulously colored rocks and pools. Dr. Orange scribbled furiously in his notebooks, sketching them and taking some crystal samples.<br/><br/>"Look at this geode!" he said. "It's probably cancerous."<br/><br/>"The professor is feeling better," said Millicent to Annette with a giggle.<br/><br/>"This is <i>better</i> for him?"<br/><br/>"Yes.

I would use those to create Drivers to refresh Stability as appropriate. A player could "Challenge" their statement as a sign of character growth or how their personality shifted under stress; this allowed them to refresh points equal to their Sanity. At the end of the session, they would need to rewrite their statement to reflect how it changed. Statements can be shattered, at which point they work like broken Drives: the PC can't earn Stability, but I could still deduct Stability by driving it.<br/><br/>All in all, this system worked pretty well, and was pivotal to the events of the following session.<br/><br/>Now back to your writeups.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450891/#Comment_450891" name="Item_208" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-25T18:42:50+00:00" title="January 25, 2016  6:42PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XII: Who By High Ordeal (Part 5)</b><br/><br/>They spent an entire day recuperating. At the end of the second day, Simeon approached Ruby, Millicent, and Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"I have invited Geronimo to meet some of the elders of my village," he said. "He recommended that I bring you. Please come with me."<br/><br/>He walked them to one of the larger buildings. Inside it was cool and dark. A low fire of fragrant wood burned in the center of the room. As their eyes adjusted to the gloom, they saw two women sitting next to the fire.<br/><br/>One was the oldest woman any of them had ever seen. Her dark skin was heavily wrinkled, but her eyes glittered in the firelight. She clutched a staff as gnarled as she was. Next to her was a younger woman with sad eyes and a certain maternal grace.<br/><br/>"This is Maryam, the widow," said Simeon, introducing the younger woman. "And this is Mahabat who saw the face of God."<br/><br/>Ruby made an elaborate gesture of respect she had seen other Afari make.<br/><br/><i>[2 point Flattery spend here--Ruby has no Anthropology, and without the language skill everything is harder.]</i><br/><br/>"You are here to look at the 1926 dig," said Simeon. The two women watched in silence. "Why are you interested in that site?"<br/><br/>"There is something there we want to stop," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"What is it that you want to stop?"<br/><br/>"The one who lies eternally. Who only speaks falsehoods and destroys lives."<br/><br/>"And how does this Liar manifest?"<br/><br/>"As a disgusting mouth with a long tongue that drips...liquid." Ruby tried to avoid smacking her lips.<br/><br/>"That Mouth was taken care of many years ago. When we saw in 1926 that they were going to break into the chamber...we destroyed the place."<br/><br/>Ruby exchanged glances with her companions. <i>The village was destroyed by a volcanic eruption</i>, she thought. <i>Are they saying...?</i><br/><br/>"It was a grievous loss to us," said Simeon. "That is why there are only four of us elders--"<br/><br/>Mahabat seized his arm in a claw-like hand. "<i>Three</i> elders," Simeon said, scowling.<br/><br/>"We will see that they do not disturb what should not be disturbed," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"There are things that you do not know. Dallol was not a place of ours--it was built by the Italians. Still, it was in our territory. Most Afari are nomads, with the exception of places like this. I have been here since before I was a Christian...and Mahabat for a very long time. But now Afari have returned to Dallol. They are mutilating themselves, cutting off fingers...hands...they say there is a voice on the wind that drives them to do these things. Perhaps it is Shaitan. Or perhaps...the voice of the Liar. In of itself, this would not be dangerous; Afari are friendly and would not harm strangers..."<br/><br/>He paused. Maryam touched his arm. "Tell them," she said in a low voice.<br/><br/>"I said there are only three elders," said Simeon. "But there is one who <i>was</i> an elder, until the white man came and there was almost war among us. Later, the white man sent his friend, Ayers, to come to us. Her name is Tshombe. Once she was one of us. Now, she serves the Mexican. I have heard he is dead. But his friend, Ayers, he still draws breath, and has never left this land. I tell you this all even though it is difficult to trust you. You are not Afari...I do not think you are even very good Christians, except for Mr. Geronimo."<br/><br/>Ruby shrugged.<br/><br/>"But you have brought the nephilim among us," said Simeon. "So we are willing to believe in you."<br/><br/>"The what?" said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"The nephilim. Since you have brought her here, I think it was perhaps your destiny to come here. We will take you to the site and watch over you when the Frenchman searches there. But I think you will need to go to Dallol. Beware of Tshombe. She was an elder for a long time, and is very powerful, and knows many things."<br/><br/><i>[So RP and OP both knew what that word meant, but none of the PCs had Theology anymore!

They were sitting in the early evening dusk, near a fire in the center of the village. Lamb was roasting on spits over the flames, filling the air with a wholesome, homey smell.<br/><br/>"Really?"<br/><br/>"Yes, many people don't realize how strong the Axum Empire was, but it was truly one of the great early Christian empires. Around 1000 AD."<br/><br/>"The time of the Vikings."<br/><br/>"Quite right! I never thought of the contrast before--the Axumites were building great monuments at the same time as the Vikings were..."<br/><br/>"Killing people?"<br/><br/>"Yes. Of course, some of us in France have Viking blood."<br/><br/>"The Normans, right?"<br/><br/>"Yes.

If anything remains of this site, it is unexplored. And if Dr. Acuna's discovery of the...statue...in the temple would be very interesting indeed. And of course, my patroness is keen on the place. We are both academics, we must follow our funding. And she is not a woman one says no to."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Geronimo and Simeon went back into the House of the Elders. Simeon translated for Geronimo, even though he had the suspicion the Elders could understand everything he said.<br/><br/>"I would like to know about your experience seeing the Face of God," said Geronimo to Mahabet.<br/><br/>"The price I paid was steep," the ancient woman said. "It was very, very, very, very long ago. And how can one describe the indescribable? How can one come to terms with the Eternal? There is not a day that I do not look back and regret the choices we made. But over time I have come to understand that to be human is to choose these things. That it is not possible for humans to resist the call of knowledge..."<br/><br/>"So you regret seeing God?"<br/><br/>"I regret that I no longer see him, but I understand that it was the choice we had to make. Humans are not made for Paradise. We must look further on. The Messenger said something like that to me once. Do you know of the Messenger? He was once very powerful in Egypt. They gave him a name. It means 'No peace at the gate.' In the language of the ancients...Nyarlat-hotep."<br/><br/>"I know of him. You spoke to him?" <br/><br/>"It is interesting. The Liar lies--this we all know. The Messenger lies as well, but his lies always have the taste of truth upon them. The Messenger told me that the nature of man is to search and become more. In fact, were it not so, he said, I could not even speak to him. So we must give up on unchangingness. It is not our fate. Still...to know the true nature of God was a rare, rare gift. No one has had it since."<br/><br/>"We all search for it. Those of us with faith."<br/><br/>"Faith is a strange thing. Maryam would know. She lost people too...her husband. She has never quite lost the mourning of him."<br/><br/>"I understand loss and morning," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Yes, your brother."<br/><br/>Geronimo was taken aback. "I guess you have seen God."<br/><br/>"I have seen much that was hidden."<br/><br/>"What do you advise a man of faith do in this situation?"<br/><br/>"There may come a difficult choice to make. Perhaps you should not ask me; I have nothing but regrets over my choices, necessary though they may have been. There are always consequences. There is no time without a choice. Even if you refuse the choice, that is a choice. And once having chosen, you create a new world that you must live in."<br/><br/>"I will think on what you have said."<br/><br/>"You should also seek the sword of righteousness.

"I'm not sure what the referent is."<br/><br/>"All the work, all the looking, all the career path stuff...what's at the end of it?"<br/><br/>"You have to remember that you can start out thinking your life is going to be one way but it turns out to be something else entirely. Take me. I grew up in a small town. I have to tell you--there's no way to say this without sounding stuck up--but I was probably the smartest person in my home town, even though I never went to college. I was so smart I used to help my father with his cases--he was a lawyer. Sometimes I even helped the police out. And I came to realize after a while that criminals are stupid people. They always get caught. If you think about it the right way. And then I began to realize that since the police didn't always catch them--and I'm talking about the regular kind of case, not some random murder or something--but since they didn't catch them all the time, the police are stupid too! And I could help the cops...or...I could start stealing things. Since I was definitely smarter than the criminals, and definitely smarter than the cops. So that's what I started to do."<br/><br/>"So you steal things now?"<br/><br/>"No, I gave that up, at least not for myself. See, I tried to steal from someone who was much smarter than <i>me</i>."<br/><br/>"Evelyn?"<br/><br/>"No, she's a good kid, not her."<br/><br/>"Bethany?"<br/><br/>"Bethany is very good at what she does. Excellent tradecraft. But she doesn't carry a candle to the old lady. She's the best of all of us...but I've said too much. If I talk to the old lady and it gets back to her..."<br/><br/>"No, let's talk about <i>Lady Chatterly's Lover</i> instead."<br/><br/><i>[If you haven't figured out who Annette Drew is, remember that she doesn't like to go by Nancy...anymore.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>The next day they finally reached the site of Acuna's dig. It was nestled in a large volcanic crater, quite ancient, and cupped inside of that was the crater and lava flows of the 1926 eruption. They found a cairn erected over the remains of a few of the workers, the only ones not buried by the explosion.<br/><br/>They spent the day combing over the site. Dr. Fauche helped them find the places where the ancient structure must have been. Here and there they found some fragments of the stone walls.<br/><br/>They looked a great deal like the rock they had found in Doug Henslowe's box. The rock that was now set in Janet's armband.<br/><br/>Ruby managed to sneak a few fragments away from Dr. Fauche's diggers, who were being quite meticulous in their cataloging of the finds.<br/><br/><i>[Filch test by RP, and Ruby kept one fragment per point spent after the test.]</i><br/><br/>Dr. Orange was the one who found the teeth. They were ugly, sharp, and evil-looking. To his unfortunately experienced eyes, they were obviously from some enormous Mouth.<br/><br/>That evening they saw a single rider approach over the sands. He sat his camel at the edge of rifle range, watching their camp. He stayed for a long time, until the sun had completely set. Then he raise one arm--in greeting? warning? as an invitation? before turning his camel around and riding away.<br/><br/>He rode in the direction of Dallol, of course.<br/><br/>Ruby found Dr. Fauche helping to secure the camp for the night. "There was a rider watching us," she said.<br/><br/>"Probably some Afari nomad," said Fauche.<br/><br/>"Maybe...but he rode off in the direction of Dallol."<br/><br/>"I've heard strange things about that place."<br/><br/>"Do you think there is any cause for concern?"<br/><br/>"In this region of the world? Yes, Miss Fitzgibbons, there is always reason for concern."<br/><br/>"But the bodyguards should be able to handle it, yes?"<br/><br/>"Bodyguards? My porters?"<br/><br/>"Oh my."<br/><br/>"We have a few people who know how to handle a weapon. Miss Ravenwood, my driver...well, I wouldn't want to mess with her in a dark alley."<br/><br/>"We've heard her fighting with your automobile. A fierce battle."<br/><br/>"Yes...there are times I am glad my grasp of English is not perfect. From what I understand, Mr. Cuevas is a soldier, <i>ne c'est pas</i>?"<br/><br/>"He's a fine bodyguard. Just keeping you abreast of the situation."<br/><br/>"Perhaps we should go there.

Ruby and Dr. Orange slid down after them.<br/><br/>As she reached the bottom of the hill, the chanters nearest to Millicent prostrated themselves in front of her. <br/><br/>"What did you do?" demanded Ruby.<br/><br/>"I didn't do anything!" squeaked Millicent.<br/><br/>"Get them to stop chanting," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>Millicent tried to communicate that in Afari.<br/><br/>The chanting stopped. Up close, they could see that many of the people had mutilated hands, feet, or faces. Some children came out of the crowd and began tugging on Millicent's clothes.<br/><br/>"Come, come," they said. "Come home."<br/><br/>"Home is in America," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"No, no, Dallol. Come, come."<br/><br/>"I don't like this," said Ruby<br/><br/>"We were going to Dallol anyway," said Geronimo. "Eventually."<br/><br/>Millicent let the children pull her into the crowd. Everyone stood up again and began to move in the direction of Dallol.<br/><br/>"Come, come," they all said. Reluctantly, Ruby, Geronimo, and Dr. Orange followed them.

It wasn\u2019t particularly impressive; a cluster of several small houses, some with tin roofs. There was a large circular meeting place in the center of the village; a big pavilion-style tent was pitched there.<br/><br/>"The houses are...they're..." said Ruby.<br/><br/>"They seem to be made of bricks of salt," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>As they entered the village, the villagers who had not made the trip to the dig site came out to meet them. As Millicent passed through them, she could hear the occasional whisper of "Nephilim!"<br/><br/>"What does that mean in Afari?" she asked one of the children.<br/><br/>"Nephilim? It means, <i>child of God</i>."<br/><br/>"Aren't we all children of God?" she said.<br/><br/>"I have a funny feeling they have a different definition in mind," said Ruby.<br/><br/>In the center of town, in front of what must be the elders of the village based on their age and dress, stood an elegant woman who matched the description they had been given of Tshombe.<br/><br/>"Welcome, my friends," she said. "Welcome, Millicent, Ruby, Geronimo, Dr. Orange."<br/><br/>The hairs on the back of Ruby's neck stood up.<br/><br/>"Excuse me, I think there's been some mistake," squeaked Millicent.<br/><br/>"No mistake, no mistake at all. You are exactly where you should be. I am very, very happy to meet you all. I have heard so much about you."<br/><br/>"Only nice things, I'm sure," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"My source was some mixed in his opinion of you, but no matter."<br/><br/>"Who was your source?" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Why, the Liar of course. So one must take everything with...what is your expression? A grain of salt."<br/><br/>Millicent giggled somewhat hysterically.<br/><br/>"You have many questions," said Tshombe. "But first sit, we will bring you water."<br/><br/>"How do they know your name?" Dr. Fauche whispered to Millicent.<br/><br/>"I don't know!"<br/><br/>"Millicent, I think I know why they know your name. I think this is a dangerous place."<br/><br/>"I'm sure it is...but why do they know my name? Did they plant a spy or something?"<br/><br/>"Don't you think we should stop pretending? This...this is all madness."<br/><br/>"No. No! Thinking that there's a bigger pattern to this is crazy. I'm just a normal girl. There's no way that a village in the middle of nowhere can know my name?"<br/><br/>Annette glance around. "Doc, you need me to vanish? Because if you want me to get out of here, I have to go <i>now</i>."<br/><br/>Millicent looked around at her friends. Ruby shook her head slightly.<br/><br/>"Fine, I'll stay," said Annette.

At least he may have thought his son could do it...until he decided to sacrifice him, because the Liar told him the sacrifice of someone important would give him power. So he threw him into the Mouth in that place in Mexico..."<br/><br/>"Chichen Xoxul."<br/><br/>"Yes. This was before the Revolution, before he came here. Before his wife left him. The Nephilim." <br/>"But aren't we all children of God? By that definition aren't we all nephilim?"<br/><br/>"No, dear Millicent. We are not. But you are very special."<br/><br/>"How was Merida special?"<br/><br/>"She was the child of a god."<br/><br/>"How can she be the child of a god?"<br/><br/>"Is this a serious question? Do you not believe this is possible? You Europeans are so strange. When I was younger my mother was in the service of the queen of Egypt, and we went with her to the greatest city in the world--or so they told us. Rainy, brick buildings...Rome was dull in the winter. The people were primitive and wore outlandish clothes, and the queen's lover, the general, rarely came to us."<br/><br/><i>[You may have guessed which queen of Egypt this was. And that means, in my continuity...that it was Hypatia Masters.]</i><br/><br/>"So some god had sex--"<br/><br/>"Sex? Ah, yes, the god shoved it's, what...is that how you think this happened? What are we but an utterance of God? What does biology have to do with it? In any case, Ram\xf3n lost Merida, fought in the Revolution, and came here. He told me he no longer believed what the Liar had told him. The sacrifice did not work. His heart had changed. And that is why we are here to say, in the language of the general, <i>ultimatum oraficio</i>. The Final Mouth."<br/><br/>"What was Ram\xf3n trying to do?"<br/><br/>"In 1921? I do not know. In 1926 he sent his man Ayers here I think to get him out of Los Angeles. I think Ram\xf3n feared Ayers would try to stop what he was doing."<br/><br/>"What was that?"<br/><br/>"I am not sure. But we, by making the Final Mouth, are saving the world."<br/><br/>"What? What are you trying to do?"<br/><br/>"Saving the world. I think Ram\xf3n was trying to destroy it."<br/><br/>"But how will this prevent the end of the world?"<br/><br/>"If the Liar can no longer be destroyed, then the world is safe."<br/><br/>"Are you getting anything by doing this?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"I think saving the world is its own reward!" retorted Tshombe.<br/><br/>"What makes you think the world is in danger? Ram\xf3n is dead!" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"But you are here. And you have been following in his footsteps, place to place, step by step."<br/><br/>"We're following the Liar," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Have you been destroying the Mouths?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"Then you are trying to destroy the world."<br/><br/>"Are you saying the world is a Mouth?" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Does it look like one? No? Then it is not."<br/><br/>"Then what are we doing? Is removing them like removing a cancer?"<br/><br/>"Are you sure it is an infection?"<br/><br/>"In our experience, we have only ever seen it cause harm to those who have encountered it," said Ruby. "Including ourselves. We have yet to see it help anyone."<br/><br/>"Who said it would help?" said Tshombe. "Are there not wild animals in your country? A wolf? Like the lion, it hunts animals. The Mouth is part of us. You cannot cut your heart out. You cannot cut your own mouth out."<br/><br/>"But we can cure smallpox..." said Millicent.<br/><br/>"You think of the Mouth as a disease, but it is part of the world."<br/><br/>"So is smallpox!"<br/><br/>"So is the wolf. So is the hawk. These prey on other animals. You say they care for their young? But the Liar gives some of us power."<br/><br/>"She has already made up her mind," said Geronimo. "This is useless. Whether she knows it or not, her motives are sinister."<br/><br/>"You look great," said Dr. Orange. "But I notice your followers are a bit worse for wear."<br/><br/>"You are Catholic," she said to Geronimo. "You, a Protestant, yes? You each worship God in your own way. My people worship God in their way. I am simply better able to understand Him."<br/><br/>"Oh, of course," muttered Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"Our work is almost finished now," said Tshombe. "Tomorrow we will throw Millicent into the Final Mouth and ensure the protection of the world--"<br/><br/>"Wait? No!" said Ruby, starting forward. Several men in the surrounding crowd pulled out rifles. Their trigger fingers were conspicuously not missing.<br/><br/>"Remember that part where we laughed at other people for walking into a trap?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"You should just leave me," said Millicent. "I can catch up later."<br/><br/>"We can't just leave you," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"I can," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"Why do we even keep you around?" said Geronimo angrily.<br/><br/>"I have the guns and explosives."<br/><br/>"Surely, Ruby," said Tshombe, "you are here to see the greatest adventure of all time."<br/><br/>"I'm all for adventure," said Ruby. "But not the death of a young lady in the prime of her life. She has many adventures to come."<br/><br/>"Would you prefer to take her place?"<br/><br/>"I thought you needed a nephilim?"<br/><br/>"Ah, so you wouldn't take her place. And yet you believe what I have said, otherwise you would not have mentioned the nephilim."<br/><br/>"I do believe you on some level. Fine. I agree to stay, on one condition: my friends are allowed to leave unharmed and unmolested."<br/><br/>"Very well. The doctor and Mr. Cuevas can go."<br/><br/>"What about Millicent?"<br/><br/>"No, she is a sacrifice. Oh, you were trying to take her place? No. We do need a nephilim. But you can stay, if you like."<br/><br/>"Then I will, for support."<br/><br/><i>[RP: Look, I'm staying with Hermione! The magic teleporting girl who can bend physics!]</i><br/><br/>"I cannot allow this," said Geronimo. "I cannot...leave you here..."<br/><br/>"Geronimo, darling. Have faith."<br/><br/>"I do. But it is my responsibility to care for you and to watch over you. And Millicent."<br/><br/>"Don't worry. We will be absolutely fine."<br/><br/>"I do not believe so."<br/><br/>"Are you performing the ritual?" said Dr. Orange to Tshombe.<br/><br/>"I am the priestess. Why, do you plan to kill me? My followers will never let you live, surely you can see that."<br/><br/>"How will this work?" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"We will summon the Mouth, and I will sacrifice great power into it."<br/><br/>"But Ram\xf3n tried that!"<br/><br/>"Ah, but he didn't use the right sacrifice. You are very special, Millicent. Do not think all my knowledge comes from the Liar."<br/><br/>"Who is telling you things?"<br/><br/>Tshombe sighed. "I grow weary of this conversation. Those who wish to depart may go. Those who wish to stay, we will provide accommodations."<br/><br/>"I'll stay," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"Ruby, we must go," said Geronimo. "The doctor will do whatever needs to be done to protect Millicent."<br/><br/>Dr. Fauche agreed to stay as well. Annette left with Ruby and Geronimo.<br/><br/><i>[GP pointed out that this was partially to absolve Geronimo of the guilt of killing people he thought were innocent.</i><br/><br/><i>I gave Ruby Stability for offering to take Millicent's place, and Dr. Orange Stability for furthering human knowledge.]</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451072/#Comment_451072" name="Item_216" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-02T16:16:19+00:00" title="February  2, 2016  4:16PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XII: Who By High Ordeal (Part 10 </b><br/><br/>"This is extremely bad," said Dr. Fauche in French to Dr. Orange. "That woman is insane!"<br/><br/>"Clearly," said Julius in the same language. "But what do you know about any of this?"<br/><br/>"I know that the Mouths exist."<br/><br/>"Then what are you doing here?"<br/><br/>Dr. Fauche paused. "My mission is very complicated. I was working for the old woman. She is not someone you want to cross! But...I was actually working for someone else. I was hoping to find her trail, and to protect Millicent as well. But now I don't know what to do! I wasn't even sure Millicent was the right one, but it seems everyone has decided she is the one we are looking for."<br/><br/>"So who are you working for?"<br/><br/>"Her name is not important. They call her M. I don't know much more than that."<br/><br/>"So explain these organizations."<br/><br/>"Epsilon Sigma was founded or perhaps revived by some crazy woman in England. They were looking for a girl, the same age as Millicent. The leader was determined that this must be done, out of some obligation or debt of honor. She was working inside M's organization. I came to work for the old woman, who was put in charge of Epsilon Sigma, but M recruited me to spy on them from the inside. Now, though, M is missing...and they gave me this Bethany woman, terrible person. She's insane! I'm surrounded by crazy women!"<br/><br/>"What are they doing about these Mouths?"<br/><br/>"There's some strange connection between Epsilon Sigma and the Mouths. I think they're making money off of them. I mean, it's a drug, right? But what they really want is her, the girl, Mirabelle."<br/><br/>"So you know the Mouths exist, but only about the drugs, not anything about what Tshombe said."<br/><br/>"Do you think she's telling the truth?"<br/><br/>"Have you <i>seen</i> these Mouths?"<br/><br/>"I've seen the small ones. They say they get much bigger."<br/><br/>"I've seen both, and it's not a pretty sight. There's all this worshiping, and killing, and eating, and gnashing of teeth...it's horrible. But we have been destroying them. There are many things that I honestly cannot put into words. I believe that this ritual will do <i>something</i>, because I've seen things like this work. I don't want to be around to see it, though. I want to stop this. In our travels I've found that it requires a certain mental fortitude not often found in the world."<br/><br/>"I think I understand."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Millicent was brought into one of the buildings made of salt. She was bathed, despite her protests that it was an incredible waste of water. They rubbed her in rose-scented oils and then wrapped her in silk robes.<br/><br/>"You really shouldn't--" she often began.<br/><br/>"Nephilim!" was their only response.<br/><br/>She began to look for an opportunity to sneak away to Tshombe's tent.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Geronimo and Ruby hiked up into the higher ground where they were met by a crowd of Dr. Fauche's porters.<br/><br/>"I know some of you must have fought against the Italians," Ruby said. "We need some men who are good with weapons. We can pay."<br/><br/>One of the porters stepped forward. "My cousin told me you are a very sharp woman," he said. "Perhaps we can make a bargain..."<br/><br/><i>[2 point Bargain spend bought her one mercenary.]</i><br/><br/>"We have a sacred duty to protect people!" said Geronimo. "In the name of God, will no one else help anyone? Surely if we fight together we will triumph."<br/><br/>Finally another man stepped forward. Geronimo noticed he was wearing a small gold cross around his neck. "I will help you, my brother," the man said.<br/><br/><i>[2 point Reassurance spend.]</i><br/><br/>Ruby set herself to watch the village through a pair of field glasses. In the gloaming, she could see white stones had been laid in a circle around the village. Men and women from the village kept following the circle, stooping to rub their hands on the stones, as if they were marking a boundary or circle.<br/><br/>"It's going to swallow the whole village," she said in a terrified whisper.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451109/#Comment_451109" name="Item_217" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-04T15:55:53+00:00" title="February  4, 2016  3:55PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XII: Who By High Ordeal (Part 11)</b><br/><br/>Millicent sat in her house. Outside a villager stood guard, and inside were three very obsequious and attentive women who waited on her every whim. Except for her main whim, which was to sneak out of building.<br/><br/>In her purse was a vial of some pentothal, in case she needed to help with surgery. Millicent was always well prepared.<br/><br/>Smiling at her attendants, she managed to fiddle in the bag and load up a syringe full of the anesthetic. Then she stood up, tried to strike a pose of divine inspiration, and fainted to the floor.<br/><br/>The women ran up to her. "She is having a vision!" one of the said. Millicent jabbed her with the syringe.<br/><br/>"Sister has fainted!" said another of the servants after Millicent's victim tumbled to the ground. "She is communicating with the goddess!" She and the other woman fell to her knees, making them easy targets for Millicent's needle.<br/><br/>Shortly after that she had pushed out a few of the large bricks of salt and crawled out into the night. She skulked through the shadows and slipped into the large tent she had seen Tshombe enter earlier.<br/><br/><i>[Preparedness for the drugs, then an interpersonal spend--Intimidate, I think, to convince the women she was in the throes of a vision--and finally Stealth.]</i><br/><br/>"Explain it to me again," she said to Tshombe.<br/><br/>The older woman looked up from the large codex she had spread out on a lectern. "Ah, yes. Tomorrow we will sacrifice you. I am not surprised to see you. I know you are very resourceful."<br/><br/>"But explain to me <i>why</i> you have to do this. I mean, if I wanted to be out of here I'd be out of here, and if I wanted you dead, you'd be dead."<br/><br/>"It's nice that you think so."<br/><br/>"I know so."<br/><br/>"Why? Because you are going to cast your magic on me? Do you not think that I am protected by my god too?"<br/><br/>"This has nothing to do with magic. Anyway, the point is, I like the world too, and I have friends too, and we both want the same thing, which is the world to continue. So I think it will work a lot better if I understand why this has to be done, and if I believe it--because if I don't, I don't think this will work as well as you want, because we're dealing with a Liar!"<br/><br/>"You don't need to believe it, you just need to fall into the Mouth tomorrow."<br/><br/>"Explain it to me anyway."<br/><br/>"You cannot destroy the Liar without destroying the world. The Liar and the world are one. You think of them as separate; I do not."<br/><br/>"Why are the Liar and the world one? Why not the Messenger and the world? Why not anyone else?"<br/><br/>"I do not know. I just know what is."<br/><br/>"But how do you know? And don't say the Liar told you, we've established that's not trustworthy."<br/><br/>"I have researched this in these books."<br/><br/>"I've got all night. Show me."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Geronimo was having a sleepless night. He patrolled the perimeter of their makeshift camp ceaselessly, determined not to let anyone surprise them. He had just reached for a cigarette when he thought he heard something behind them. He turned around for a moment, but saw nothing.<br/><br/>When he turned back he saw Simeon standing in front of him.<br/><br/>"Simeon," he said.<br/><br/>"How strong is your faith, Warrior of God?"<br/><br/>"It's very strong. It is the most important thing."<br/><br/>From the shadows stepped Maryam and Mahabet, leaning on a stick that was shaped almost like a serpent.<br/><br/>"You know we have powers to combat the Mouths," said Simeon.<br/><br/>"Please aid me."<br/><br/>"For us to unleash the volcano, and for the Elders a thousand years ago to calcify the Mouth, required the sacrifice of our most purified and sanctified warriors, people who had studied in the ways of the Guardians for all their life. They had to sacrifice their life in the effort. You understand that this is the largest Mouth, the ultimate Mouth...the Last Mouth. The Mouth that will eat the world. We do not have enough Guardians left. There is only the three of us. But you must understand that the reason it is possible to sacrifice a Guardian is that a Guardian spends his life not only gaining knowledge, but regaining his innocence. How strong is your faith, Warrior of God?"<br/><br/>"It is strong enough to sacrifice myself if I am called upon."<br/><br/>"That is not the sacrifice that is being asked. To complete the ritual we need the sacrifice of innocents."<br/><br/>Simeon paused and stared out at the village of Dallol. Some children were running around the fire, and the faint sounds of their singing came to them on the wind. "There are innocents in that village," he said.<br/><br/>"I cannot stand for that. My faith dictates that I am to protect those innocents and never allow them to be harmed."<br/><br/>Maryam stepped forward. "You argue this? You believe in Yeshua? You believe in the Son of God, who was the most innocent of all, and he sacrificed to save people."<br/><br/>"It was a choice that he made. I cannot allow what you ask for."<br/><br/>"Do you think the mother of Yeshua wanted to allow his sacrifice?"<br/><br/>"She was not happy about it, but it was his decision..."<br/><br/>"Was it? Was it? Have you not read your Bible? Do you not remember the Garden? He <i>begged</i> for it not to happen."<br/><br/>"I don't think that is right. I don't believe that it is correct in my faith, to sacrifice the innocent."<br/><br/>Mahabet stepped forward. She spoke, in beautiful, elegant Spanish. "And who are you to know what innocence is? You have been born in sin. You have never seen God. You have never known God. And you say this to me, that you will decide who is to live and who is to die, who is innocent and who is not?"<br/><br/>"I'm not deciding who will live and die, I am saying I will not participate in the death of innocents."<br/><br/>"And so the great evil will happen, and you will allow this?"<br/><br/>"There should be a way to prevent the evil without the death of children!"<br/><br/>"Such choices are not always given to us, as I had to learn, much to my detriment."<br/><br/>Simeon held up a hand. "I understand, Warrior of God. I hope you are right. I fear you are not. We have watched and prevented this for a very long time. Every year that has passed, I have grown wearier and wearier of this burden. Perhaps it is best that we fail finally, and this endless life of drudgery with it."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451146/#Comment_451146" name="Item_218" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-05T16:45:08+00:00" title="February  5, 2016  4:45PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XII: Who By High Ordeal (Part 12)</b><br/><br/>"So, as you can see in the <i>Revelations of Glaaki</i>, the sacrifice of a Nephilim..." said Tshombe, pointing at a handwritten passage scrawled in an ancient tome.<br/><br/><i>[MP pointed out that Millicent could certainly keep up with Tshombe, given that she had Cthulhu Mythos 5.]</i><br/><br/>"But I'm not a nephilim!

Then I pointed out that Millicent's value statement of being a normal person was shattered, as Tshombe had proved in multiple ways that Millicent was absolutely special.

In the early morning, when the only sign of dawn was a light blue band at the horizon, Dr. Orange awoke with a start. He yawned, and stuck his head out of the doorway to take the air.<br/><br/>He saw two men with rifles heading towards his house.<br/><br/>He pulled his head back inside, and ducked up alongside the doorway, trying to stay very still.<br/><br/><i>[Sense Trouble, then Stealth.]</i><br/><br/>One of the Afari stepped into the room. He raised his rifle, sighting it at the sleeping body of Dr. Fauche--<br/><br/>Dr. Orange blew his brains out with his pistol.<br/><br/>The other Afari jumped in the room and butted Dr. Orange in the stomach. The German doubled over, backed up a step, and winged the man in the chest with another round from his pistol. The Afari began to scream and started to crawl for the door. Dr. Fauche came awake and jumped up.<br/><br/>"What do we do?" he said wildly. "Should we let him go? I'm not a percussive archaeologist!"<br/><br/>"No!"<br/><br/>Dr. Fauche pulled their attacker back into the house. "Now what do I do?" he said.<br/><br/>"Hit him on the head with the rifle!"<br/><br/>Dr. Fauche chopped the butt of the rifle into the back of the man's neck. There was a cracking sound and the Afari slumped to the floor.<br/><br/>"I think he's dead!"<br/><br/>"No, he's fine," said Dr. Orange, trying to get a look outside. "He's sleeping.

"The doctor has taken care of that for us." He began to jog down the hill toward the town.<br/><br/>Ruby dithered for a moment. Her mind was whirling. All her life she had wanted adventure, to go beyond the horizon, to push herself to the limits.<br/><br/>But instead of the dashing heroics she had expected, she found herself in a land dryer than bones, telling the man she loved to go and shoot a woman, in order to save a young person who might not even be human and was definitely possessed of enormous supernatural power.<br/><br/>Not to mention the Doc, who seemed to have started killing people again.<br/><br/>"Maybe I'm not up for this," she said to herself, faintly, and then marched grimly behind Geronimo.<br/><br/><i>[RP wanted to be able to "tell the truth" to the Liar. I pointed out that she spoke the Tongue of Lies, so a Cthulhu Mythos and Flattery spend might make that possible.

He lifted the flap, but only saw Millicent.<br/><br/>"Tshombe disappeared when the shots started," whispered Millicent. "And by that, I mean she vanished in front of my eyes. But she has to come back sooner or later."<br/><br/>"Let's get out of here," said Geronimo. He and Millicent sneaked around the side of the tent. \n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Ruby strode into town, head held straight, reciting the Tongue of Lies. Around her, people began to gather. "Are you a priestess?" said some of them to her in Afari. She kept walking.<br/><br/>Most of the village had gathered in the center of town, chanting softly; cantors scattered around the crowd provided the call and response for them. A few men with guns were running toward the edge of town, but Ruby ignored them.<br/><br/>Ruby walked slowly, trying to summon up every ounce of confidence she had, and stood in the middle of the crowd. Out of the corner of her eye she saw Geronimo and Millicent hiding behind Tshombe's tent, but didn't acknowledge them.<br/><br/><i>[RP: Could I Lie to them about what they need to do?</i><br/><i>Me: You wanna make another Cthulhu Mythos spend along with your Flattery...</i><br/><i>RP: I'm out of Mythos.</i><br/><i>MP: You could borrow some from me!

She is trying to summon something to destroy the Mouth. She will summon...the Fisher. The FisherFromOutside."<br/><br/>She raised her arms in benediction. There was a flash of bronze in the first rays of dawn, and she felt a sharp pain on her lower left arm. She whirled around and found herself face-to-face with Tshombe, who was holding a bronze Egyptian war sickle.<br/><br/>"Ah, a witch's duel," said the Elder. "I have not indulged myself in so long."<br/><br/>From the edge of town came the sound of an explosion. A cloud of salt and smoke rose into the air. Ruby tried to pretend like that was her plan all along.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Dr. Orange and Dr. Fauche dashed out of their house and ran two buildings over. Dr. Orange kicked in the door and they stepped inside. From the curtains on the open window, Julius saw four teams of two men with guns begin to search their area, house by house.<br/><br/>"What do we do?" said Dr. Fauche. "I've never been hunted like this."<br/><br/>"Oh, you get used to it, being German. I'm a Social Democrat, this is nothing. Try running from those <i>Freikorps</i> assholes, then you can talk to me." Dr. Orange fished in his pack for some dynamite. He waited until one of the teams had entered a house only a...stick of dynamite's throw away.<br/><br/>The explosive sailed through the open doorway and detonated inside, destroying the house completely along with its occupants. The other three teams converged on the crater.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451218/#Comment_451218" name="Item_222" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-09T16:41:51+00:00" title="February  9, 2016  4:41PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XII: Who By High Ordeal (Part 14)</b><br/><br/>Geronimo saw Tshombe appear out of the thin air behind Ruby and slice at the American's arm. The wound seemed to bleed much more than he'd expect, not that he pondered that very long as he dropped into firing position, crouching on one knee, aiming without thinking about it, waiting for the space between heartbeats to fire--<br/><br/>The shot rang out--perfectly aimed, sure to kill any human target--but faster than the eye could see the sickle flashed again, sweeping around to intercept the bullet. There was a clanging noise, and the now-bent and ruined sickle sailed off into the air. Tshombe's face froze in surprise. She looked up and saw Geronimo and Millicent crouching by her tent.<br/><br/>She said a single word in Afari and half the crowd turned and charged them.<br/><br/><i>[Tshombe had magical protection (basically an ablative armor which I chromed with the sickle.) She took damage from the shot, but as long as Health stays above zero that's mostly cosmetic.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Dr. Fauche and Dr. Orange dashed through the smoke, easily eluding the patrols running behind them. They heard a rifle shot ring out and then heard the crowd shout as one. They saw the villagers surging in one direction, but couldn't see what they were running at.<br/><br/>"Let's get under cover!" said Dr. Orange. They kicked in the door of a house and ran inside.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Millicent's eyes widened as people ran at her, eyes rolling in their sockets. "I can't let them get to me, I can't let them get to me--"<br/><br/>The crowd covered half the distance towards her. Then half the remaining distance. Then half the remaining distance. Then half the remaining distance...never getting quite to her.<br/><br/><i>[Millicent spent two of her Aberrance pool here. This was a four-point Mythos shock Stability loss for everyone; Ruby went below 0 and lost a point of Sanity.]</i><br/><br/>"Oooh, Zeno's paradox," said Dr. Orange from his hidden vantage point. "See, good thing they don't have power series..."<br/><br/>"So it is true," said Geronimo to himself. "She can do miracles."<br/><br/>Ruby stumbled back, mind reeling at what she was seeing...it was impossible...but...Tshombe wasn't watching her...she raised her little automatic and ran off a couple of shots. One struck Tshombe in the shoulder, and she screamed in pain. Blood ran off her shoulderblades and dripped into the sand.<br/><br/>"What are you doing, Ruby?" said Tshombe. "Do you think this will stop anything?"<br/><br/>"For about a minute," said Ruby hopefully.<br/><br/>"The Mouth was born before dawn. It only grows now. But since you wish to see a Mouth..."<br/><br/>She leaped in the air, robe flying behind, her mouth transforming into the evil lipless gash of a minor Mouth. She pounced on Ruby, knocking her down, trying to push past the American's desperate defense.<br/><br/>Geronimo clubbed his rifle and viciously cut a swath through the crowd, leaving a wake of mutilated bodies. The crowd cleared in front of him for a moment. The sun burst over the horizon, and for a second he could see daylight between Ruby and Tshombe as the Afari reared her head back to tear out her victim's throat.<br/><br/>Geronimo put a bullet into her left temple. Tshombe slumped to the ground.

In the sunlight it was clear they had really been the tips of enormous teeth.<br/><br/>The Afari fell to their knees, chanting at the top of their lungs.<br/><br/>"We have to try to destroy it!" shouted Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"We don't have time!" said Ruby. "We have to go!"<br/><br/>"Time?" said Millicent. "Time? We can have all the time in the world..."<br/><br/>She raised her arms, and said a Word--<br/><br/>It was the dust Ruby noticed. It stopped drifting on the breeze. It stopped drifting...at all. She looked up. A drop of sweat on one of the Afari men near her slowed...slowed...dripped off his face...and froze.<br/><br/>In mid-air.<br/><br/>Dr. Orange moved toward Millicent, who seemed to be the center of the phenomenon. He noticed that with the dimension of time radically enlarged, other things had become...relative. Things like the length of his arms and legs, for one thing.<br/><br/>He tossed Geronimo his pack of explosives and looked up at the rising sun.<br/><br/>He fell to his knees, knowing he was the first human being to ever see this.<br/><br/>Ahead of him, the rising sun had changed in color and brightness, becoming an intense, actinic blue. The light was blinding--quite literally--and he had to turn away. Behind him, he saw a lantern glowing in an intense red. The few remaining stars had all shifted in color.<br/><br/>He was beholding Doppler shift. The visible Doppler shift of sunlight.<br/><br/>From the horizon halos of light of different colors arced over the bone dry hills. Wordless appreciation bubbled up in him as he stared at the rainbow wrought by gravity. Had he tears, he would have wept.<br/><br/><i>[I kicked the Doc back a point of Stability for seeing what only he would appreciate.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Millicent my dear, did you really think all you risked were your friends when you intervened? Did you not sense somehow that you were drawing <i>attention</i> to yourself? Or did you think that you could just keep getting away with it, that there was no greater consequence to announcing yourself to the universe than a few extra moments of time available for you to play with?<br/><br/>Because you were wrong. And even as you stood stunned beneath the coronal glare of a blue sun, something was already lurching toward you, roughly, a beast already born but with purpose unfulfilled\u2026\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>They planted the explosives and ran as quickly as they could for the edge of the village. Millicent struggled to keep up, but when they were all past the ring of enormous teeth she gave a sigh and said another Word...<br/><br/>The explosions went off almost immediately. It was not enough--by a long shot--to destroy such an enormous Mouth. But it did damage--horrible damage, judging by the harsh shrieks that filled the air. And it obliterated the inhabitants of Daillol, destroying the blood sacrifice, and rendering the Great Mouth weakened, emaciated, twisted and abominable.<br/><br/>Dr. Fauche moaned and tried to crawl toward the Mouth, his sanity nearly blasted away, but Dr. Orange was able to stop him. The two mercenaries they had recruited from the porters both ran into the maw of the Mouth and vanished.<br/><br/>They lost all sense of time after that, probably mercifully.<br/><br/><i>[That was an eight point Mythos shock, because seriously don't screw with the spacetime continuum for your own jollies.

It turned out that they had no memory of the last several days--nothing since they had wounded the Great Mouth.<br/><br/>When they had recovered from the severe dehydration and exposure they had suffered, Maryam came to talk to them. "Perhaps you should go talk to Dr. Ayers," she said.<br/><br/>"Hasn't he vanished?" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"We did not tell you the entire truth. He came to us after the destruction of the temple site, and we helped him. Ruby, you share a common affliction with him."<br/><br/>Ruby looked at the bandage on her arm. Something under it moved. She bit her lip as the smell of Nectar filled the air.<br/><br/><i>[And here I finally revealed what I was using to figure out how Millicent's power worked--I took the Dreamscaping table from </i>Dreamhounds of Paris<i> and basically used it to let Millicent...Realityscape. This table is basically broken down into 2, 4, 6 and 8 for Target Numbers...and that's the Mythos Shock Stability loss for those effects. So with great power comes great madness. Also, Millicent was not immune to it.]</i><br/><br/>"He <i>was</i> afflicted as you," said Maryam. "That was ten years ago."<br/><br/>"Let's go," said Ruby.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Simeon led them into the desert...up to a point. "Beyond here I cannot go," he said. "This is a place...well, not of evil, but a place where I have no power."<br/><br/>"If it is a place of good, should I not be here?" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"I think you are beyond questions of good and evil. Certainly beyond my understanding."<br/><br/>"I mean will I reveal it or something?"<br/><br/>"I trust your ability to control yourself."<br/><br/>They said their goodbyes and hiked forward, the sun setting behind them. After a time, they came to a rise made of slate. Beyond it was a small grotto. They saw a man sitting cross-legged, with his back to them.<br/><br/>He looked like he was made of leather and sticks--they had never seen someone so emaciated. Long gray hair flowed down his back in twisted locks. He turned to look at them.<br/><br/>He had a huge Mouth over his stomach. But even from that distance they could see that it was calcified, stony, and not moving a bit.<br/><br/>"Dr. Ayers, I presume?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>The man stared for a long moment, then gave a single nod.<br/><br/>"You and I share a common problem. How...how did you do this?"<br/><br/>Ayers pointed at the east, where twilight had already gathered. "Laa...laaa...later," he croaked.<br/><br/>They waited. At sunset, he drank a surprisingly small amount of water from the rusty trickle that flowed through the grotto, then meditated for several hours. He ate a small amount of a very plain porridge, then rolled over and fell asleep almost immediately.<br/><br/>He hadn't talked once since that one word. In fact, he barely even made a sound, no matter what he was doing. <br/><br/><br/><br/> <br/>The next morning Ayers awoke with first light and moved slowly to the grotto. He drank a great deal more water than he had the night before, then sat cross-legged in front of the rest of them. For a long moment, he had a look of intense struggle on his face. Finally, he said...<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"Yes?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"How do I calcify it like you did?"<br/><br/>"Silence." <br/><br/>Everyone looked at Ayers.<br/><br/>"Tell?" he said. Ruby nodded. Ayers rubbed the frozen Mouth on his midriff. "Danger," he said.<br/><br/>"Show?" suggested Millicent.<br/><br/>Ayers shook his head. "It...has been a very long time since I talked. I guess you are here because of Ram\xf3n? I figured it would eventually come to something like this. How bad is it out there?"<br/><br/>"The Mouths have been spreading," said Ruby. "We've been fighting them, but one just opened up in Dallol."<br/><br/>"They said it was the last one," said Millicent.<br/><br/>Ayers nodded. "I felt that."<br/><br/>"It is a disgusting thing," said Ruby.<br/><br/>Ayers looked at her with a trace of amusement. Ruby flushed, staring at his stomach.<br/><br/>"I am afflicted as well," she said. "What should I do?"<br/><br/>"Mouth...talks. Mouth...eats. Mouth wants, desires, controls. You have seen the ones that make you angry? The ones that make you...well, all those lusts feed the Mouth. To starve it, you must resist them."<br/><br/>"So you must become a Buddhist?" said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Buddhism would be easier. I can teach you some of what I know. It takes a long time. Or you can amputate. Or you can try to live with it...although it will eventually consume you."<br/><br/>"How long would it take?"<br/><br/>"I could teach you something in a week...but you won't learn anything very useful until a month has passed. It took me a year to overcome my affliction."<br/><br/>"Be quiet for a month?" pondered Ruby. She stood up with sudden decision.<br/><br/>"Geronimo, we need to find a surgeon," she said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the end, they agreed to stay a week, to learn what they could from Ayers. He still talked very little, and almost never about his former life. Once, he asked about Job.<br/><br/>"How is Edgar?"<br/><br/>"He's fine," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"Really?"<br/><br/>"Yes, he's still doing his work in Georgia...at his institution..."<br/><br/>"Ah. I don't know what Ram\xf3n wanted for him, but it wasn't that."<br/><br/>"He writes equations all over the walls," said Millicent. "About...conic sections?"<br/><br/>"That makes no sense," said Ayers.<br/><br/>"No kidding," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"No, I mean he was a physicist more than a mathematician."<br/><br/>"Ja," said Dr. Orange. He wondered again about his encounter with Job...about light cones and...hyperspace, which was a thing he now knew existed...could it be that Job was actually on to something? But what?<br/><br/><i>[1 point Physics spend by the doc.]</i><br/><br/>"Tshombe, the woman who opened the Mouth...said that Ram\xf3n sent you here because you would try and stop him from doing what he was doing."<br/><br/>"The Elder was probably right. Ram\xf3n was trying to do many strange things."<br/><br/>"She said he was going to end the world."<br/><br/>"That is a distinct possibility. Ram\xf3n became convinced of the illusory nature of existence...and he wanted the illusions to end. He hated the lie, and that is why he was so dedicated against the Liar, which was a secret he held from all of us. I only suspected it at the time."<br/><br/>"Is that why she said destroying the Mouths would end the world? I'm confused."<br/><br/>"As am I. Ram\xf3n was a strange man with deep sorrows."<br/><br/>"Because his sister died? Drowned on that ship?"<br/><br/>"Merida? Merida did not die. But she left him. He never told me the full story. But I know he told her on the ship what he had done to Salvador. I guess before the collision...strange that there was a collision..."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Deciding that not getting her amputation done by an Italian military surgeon was advisable, they flew up to Athens to meet Jimmy. Millicent wired Freddie Blakely and he sent a Harley street surgeon he had gone to Oxford with to do the surgery.<br/><br/>The surgery was done quite successfully. Even before it, Ruby had already been planning out how to accessorize her prosthetic.<br/><br/>Geronimo did some research. He discovered that the first Ethiopian converted to Christianity was a man named...Simeon.<br/><br/>But that happened in the first century. It was perhaps anti-climactic when he discovered that Mahabet was one translation into Coptic for \u201cEve\u201d.<br/><br/>Dr. Orange was working on his own project. It had to do with evaporation rates, and wind patterns...he had already realized that the climate of Ethiopia would cause the Nectar the Dallol Mouth would produce to evaporate...but it would be a long time before it would precipitate out of the air into a body of water.<br/><br/>Like the Nile. He figured they had a few months.<br/><br/><br/>Right after her surgery, Ruby was groggily reliving in her dreams the moment Tshombe attacked her, over and over again.<br/><br/>Suddenly she sat up. "She said the Mouth had already been born! <i>Already been born</i>! That means it wasn't the Last Mouth! That means..."<br/><br/>Moments later she dashed out into the hallway. Several nurses tried to grab her. "Where's my arm!" she screamed. "Where is it! <i>Where is it</i>!"<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451296/#Comment_451296" name="Item_227" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-12T15:27:49+00:00" title="February 12, 2016  3:27PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd totally forgotten about the evaporated Nectar and the Nile.

He luffed the sails and soon was tying up. He walked down the dock and up the path to the villa he was renting.<br/><br/>Behind him the sun dazzled on the purple blue water of the Aegean. He stopped for a moment to breathe in air scented by flowers, listening to the distant sounds of the little village that wrapped around the shoreline, then climbed the stairs and stepped into his house.<br/><br/>It was a large, whitewashed clapboard building, furnished incongruously with heavy furniture in the English style except in the sun room adjacent to the piazza, which had managed to bring in a breath of Mediterranean charm. Perched on an overstuffed leather armchair was an old man, drinking a from a cup of tea. There was a cane resting against one of the armrests of his chair, but he stood up without it and greeted Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Dr. Seward," said Jimmy. "How is everyone?"<br/><br/>"Well, you have managed to collect quite a bit of human detritus this time," said the old psychologist, but with a wry grin. "Were I a Freudian, I could become famous just off of Mr. Cuevas alone."<br/><br/>"I was wondering how you were with Millicent."<br/><br/>"I've been trying to help her, but she keeps on bringing up my connection to that terrible Irish playwright. What horrid press, I'm sure I'll never live it down."<br/><br/>Jimmy grunted and went to the sideboard to make himself a drink.<br/><br/>"I've been doing what I can," said Seward, picking up his cane and hobbling over to Jimmy. "Today I managed to elicit a spark of hope from her."<br/><br/>"How'd you manage to do that?"<br/><br/>"I told her that the thing about the powers of darkness is, there's never just one."<br/><br/>"That does sound like the thing that would cheer her up. Where's Janet?"<br/><br/>"Out walking with your friend Karen, I believe."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Jimmy had indeed brought Karen Eliot over from Los Angeles to try and cheer Janet up, although at first Janet didn't know why he thought that would do anything.<br/><br/>"I don't know your friend," she had said. "I might have seen one of those shorts she was in, what are they, <i>Man Hood, Journalist</i>--"<br/><br/>"<i>Guy Manning, Ace Reporter</i>," corrected Jimmy. "Just talk to her. I think you find you have...a lot in common."<br/><br/>That very morning, they had taken breakfast on the piazza. Sometime between oranges and a third cup of coffee, Karen had broken the news of her real identity.<br/><br/>"Jackson Elias? The reporter?" said Janet.<br/><br/>"Well, Elisa Olney if you want to get technical. My friends called me Jax."<br/><br/>"But...you're dead, aren't you? I mean, it was in the news, very well documented."<br/><br/>"Should I quote Twain?"<br/><br/>"But...how..."<br/><br/>"I'm a friend of Jimmy's," said Karen simply.<br/><br/>"Why didn't you...why didn't you tell people? Take back your career?"<br/><br/>"Oh," said Karen. She nervously twisted a napkin. "See...I was involved in something really terrible, really dark...I learned there are powers <i>out there</i>, and there's so little we can do to fight them. And, well, I kind of lost my fighting nature. I mean, we won the war, so to speak. I could rest. And I found out that maybe I didn't need to be Jackson Elias anymore. That she had served her purpose."<br/><br/>They sat in near silence for a while, broken only by the muffled sound of the Thing on Janet's arm.<br/><br/>"I can understand that," said Janet with a sigh. "I don't know what I'll be after this...or what Jimmy and I will end up being. I'm glad he's been here...I think I would have been destroyed otherwise."<br/><br/>Karen nodded.<br/><br/>"You know I edited your collected writings?" said Janet.<br/><br/>Karen frowned. "Yeah.

Still, it seems very careless to lose an arm."<br/><br/>"You know, Charlie..." began Ruby.<br/><br/>"Yes, all right.

I may not always be around to help you out."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Millicent got a letter from Jimmy's people in the Special Branch, some of whom were being used as investigators for the Los Angeles Society of Archaeological Studies. She dropped the letter when she was finished reading it.<br/><br/>Vanessa was missing. The Greys hadn't made a big deal out of it yet, but she had vanished from her house in Venice Beach. The house didn't look like it was broken into, and some of her clothes and a suitcase were missing, so it did not seem that she was kidnapped. It looked like she had left on her own.<br/><br/>Millicent sent a telegram and some money to Jimmy's people, asking them to take a closer look at the house and giving them some ideas of what to look for. They soon reported back that there were signs that she had been living with someone. And some of Millicent's clothes that she kept at the house were missing.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Jimmy checked on Dr. Fauche, who had come back with them from Ethiopia. He was not doing well, spending most of his days raving "<i>La Bouche! La Bouche!</i>" Dr. Seward was trying to help, but it wasn't looking hopeful.<br/><br/>"I am never leaving you people alone again," said Jimmy to Ruby and Millicent when he found them in the kitchen. "How did you get a Mouth on your arm again?"<br/><br/>"I accidentally completed a ritual, and that summoned up the Final Mouth. So I had it cut off, and now it's missing--we should really get that back, and set it on fire..." began Ruby.<br/><br/>"And what was it Dr. Orange said about you breaking the spacetime continuum?" said Jimmy to Millicent.<br/><br/>"I'm sorry," she said. "I was hoping to give him enough time to set the explosives..."<br/><br/>"You do not break the spacetime continuum to solve a problem!"<br/><br/>"That wasn't part of the plan!"<br/><br/>"It should never be part of any plan!"<br/><br/>"Jimmy," said Dr. Seward gently, "Pot, kettle?"<br/><br/>Jimmy made an expression that somehow combined regret, resignation, and frustration.<br/><br/>"You can do it too?" chirped Millicent.<br/><br/>"He needed a little help!" retorted Dr. Seward.<br/><br/>"When I did it, this shit didn't happen!" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Five people died when you did it!" said Dr. Seward.<br/><br/>"Wait, Jimmy, when have you used magic?" said Ruby. "You haven't told us that?"<br/><br/>"Is there a safer way to do it?" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Jimmy, I do believe an explanation is in order," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"It was not my fault," said Jimmy darkly.<br/><br/>"I'm not saying it is," said Ruby. "I'm fully accepting what I did--"<br/><br/>"I'm sorry," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"I'm not mad at you dear. You broke some of the laws of physics, but there are no police to--well, wait, for all we know there might well be--"<br/><br/>"The last two times I've done it, someone has lost their arm. That's why I tried to go to the asylum. Only I never got there, I ended up in Ethiopia instead and all my luggage was there..."<br/><br/>"That's why you don't do it!" said Jimmy.

Humans had been living there since the stone age, but mostly it was colonized by Sicilians and North Africans, before becoming a base for the Knights of Rhodes, who defended it from an Ottoman invasion in the 16th century. During Napoleon's Egyptian Campaign, he had seized the island from the Knights; the British had subsequently conquered it, and now it was an important naval base for them.<br/><br/>Most of the locals spoke Italian and/or Maltese, along with English. There had been a long standing movement to unite with Italy, but the rise of the Fascists had mostly put an end to that.<br/><br/><i>[Library Use!]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Millicent dropped in on Annette Drew. "I know this sounds really crazy, but--have you been secretly slipping away and visiting Vanessa Brady in Los Angeles?"<br/><br/>"No. I checked in on her a few times, but that's all," said Annette.<br/><br/>"Which means that if any of the people you can't talk about--"<br/><br/>"Oh, I can talk about them. What do you want to know?"<br/><br/>"What do they do?"<br/><br/>"I guess mostly they look for you."<br/><br/>"Why?"<br/><br/>"Apparently you are very important to them in some way. I don't think they're looking at you in a bad way--there's not a sacrificial knife at the end of this."<br/><br/>"If I were looking for somebody, though, I'd look for somebody smart. Like you."<br/><br/>"The thing is that they need to find you, or this person <i>Mirabelle</i>? And I guess it was Jimmy who made this really hard. After a while it became obvious it was you. And Dr. Fauche seems to have confirmed this hypothesis."<br/><br/>"Is it possible that someone on your end could have visited Vanessa?"<br/><br/>"I wouldn't put it past them.

Until she could get some people in to modify the controls of the <i>Brightening Dawn</i>, she was unable to fly the plane.<br/><br/>"Don't worry, Ruby, I've flown her plenty of times!" said Betty chirpily. <br/><br/>"I still say I could copilot," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Nah, Millicent is fine, she's a quick study."<br/><br/>"She never told me she could fly a plane before."<br/><br/>"She never says nothing to nobody. I respect that."<br/><br/><i>[MP put some points into Pilot...6! This was a carryover from ditching Contacts and Covers.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>They took off into a beautiful dawn, the wine-dark Aegean falling away beneath them as Betty gunned the engines and did a graceful turning climb. Ruby was sitting with Charlie in the forward compartment, drinking mimosas and grumpily re-running the fuel-to-weight calculations. Jimmy, Geronimo, Annette, and Janet were in the back, watching the peach-colored clouds flow past the observation blisters.<br/><br/>Time passed. Jimmy watched Janet carefully--a habit of his lately. She was moodily staring out the windows at nothing in particular. While Millicent and Annette chattered away about books (and the dirty parts therein), Janet reached into her flight bag and took out her cigarette case.<br/><br/>Jimmy suddenly realized something. His blood ran cold for a moment as he grabbed Janet's bag.<br/><br/>"Jimmy, what are you doing?" she said, surprised.<br/><br/>"I put that bag into the cargo bay before we took off."<br/><br/>"What are you talking about? I've had it with me all morning. This bag has never left my possession."<br/><br/>Jimmy tore through the bag. A notebook, her lighter, a novel, some makeup, a flask. <br/><br/><i>[Sense Trouble roll by our resident Big Damn Hero. I had a little countdown clock that determined how much time they had to find and defuse the bomb based on the Sense Trouble roll. Sadly, I needed to work a bit harder on the actual implementation of the countdown, but that will be for the third campaign, wherein Aviatrix actually gets something right.]</i><br/><br/>Geronimo stood up. "Jimmy, can we get into the cargo bay from here?"<br/><br/>"Yes," said Jimmy, already prying up a panel on the floor. He pulled it open and dove down into the cold darkness below. He pulled the bags aside manically until he found the bag that matched Janet's carry-on.<br/><br/>It was suspiciously heavy.<br/><br/><i>[Evidence Collection spend to find it quickly.]</i><br/><br/>He climbed back into the cabin and put the bag down on the floor. Ruby, her face contorted by fear and rage, and Charlie were standing by the companionway that ran through the galley.<br/><br/>Everyone held their breath as Jimmy slowly opened the bag.<br/><br/>"Can't we just toss it outside?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"No. We don't know how it is rigged. It could explode if we shake it too much," said Geronimo. He knelt down by Jimmy and looked in the bag.<br/><br/>His first impression was of the absolute professionalism of the job. <i>This will be a difficult bomb to defuse</i>, he thought. It had a timer, and a shock detonator as backup--and strangely, a radio receiver, although he couldn't think of any remote detonator that had enough range.<br/><br/>"Annette, you know anything about bombs?" barked Jimmy.<br/><br/>"What do I look like? I'm an investigator," said Annette, her face pale.<br/><br/>"<i>Silencio</i>," said Geronimo. "The Fascists used bombs, although not as complex as these. I will do what I can. Jimmy, we need to partially disassemble it...I'm not sure good enough a mechanic to do it right."<br/><br/>"Millicent is our best mechanic while Doc Orange is away," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"<i>Ja, aber er is nicht hier</i>," said Jimmy. He pulled a small repair kit from under the seats and began to work on the bomb. "<i>Ach, sehr klug...</i>" he muttered as he deftly removed the outer casing, exposing a nest of wires inside.<br/><br/><i>[They needed to make a 4-point Mechanical Repair spend to be able to defuse the bomb. Jimmy used his Gol-Goroth ability to borrow points from Dr. Orange, even though OP had to miss the session. They system works!]</i><br/><br/>Geronimo worked on the bomb feverishly for ten minutes, sweat beading heavily on his brow. He had managed to remove most of the wires, but the last few had him dithering. Finally, he cut a red wire.<br/><br/>The clock wired into the bomb as a timer began to spin rapidly towards midnight. <i>Madre Maria, estamos muertos</i>, he thought.<br/><br/>Millicent came flying down the corridor from the cockpit, sliding down on one knee next to the bomb. She wrenched the pliers out of Geronimo's hands and pulled two more wires out of their sockets.<br/><br/>The clock stopped with twenty seconds remaining.<br/><br/>"<i>Mann muss alle die Dr\xe4hte herausrei\xdfen</i>," she said.<br/><br/><i>[And Millicent follows suit, saving the day; GP rolled a 1.

We had it all under control," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Too bad."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Jimmy slid onto the bench next to Ruby in the forward compartment. "I have to ask you something," he said.<br/><br/>"Yes, James?"<br/><br/>"See, the Messenger gave me something too when we saw her...it...in Ethiopia. A ritual.

Turning over his leads and talking to the local rough boys, he discovered to his surprise that the local criminal element didn't seem to know much about Montgomery Donovan, other than that he was rich. He returned to the hotel lost in thought.<br/><br/>Millicent had more success, trawling the libraries and the newspaper morgue. "Look, Mr. Wright," she said eagerly when he came into their suite. "I've found out a lot, I think. See, here is Mr. Donovan at the opera--he's a patron of the local opera company. Oh, and here are the companies he's involved with, mostly import-export. Also, his wife is dead, died several months ago. He looks really clean, at least from the outside."<br/><br/>"He's done a good job then," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"He's very reclusive, doesn't like to meet with people...the few interviews he's done were at the operahouse."<br/><br/>"Let's get my evening jacket ready, then.

Most of the people he called wouldn't talk to him--they simply said Donovan wasn't doing anything that was illegal as far as they knew, and had been very good to their business/opera/shipping company. But he got enough from them and looking at the public records Millicent had compiled to figure out that his large network of concerns, trusts, and subsidiaries was making a <i>lot</i> more money than they had the previous year. <br/><br/>"Trammell\u2019s book had a letter from Donovan talking about the enormous increase in production," he mused.<br/><br/><i>[Accounting spend by JP.]</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451441/#Comment_451441" name="Item_235" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-18T17:05:53+00:00" title="February 18, 2016  5:05PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a personal aside, I'll be at Dreamation in Morristown NJ for the weekend, starting tonight.

They met in a greasy dockside tavern, full of the thick smell of frying fish and olive oil.<br/><br/>"What do these guys do?" she said to Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Drugs and smuggling," said Geronimo. "Sometimes they run guns. The Republic had dealings with them from time to time. Oh, and a sideline in 'losing' things off of ships."<br/><br/>The capo came out of the kitchen and sat down across from them. "I'm Carlu," he asid. "So you're the friend of Jose's, eh? We've done a nice business sending him weapons, so I'm happy to meet another client."<br/><br/><i>[Me: Ruby, so you're using Flattery on this guy? How are you doing this, through </i>bonhomie<i> or </i>decolletage<i>?</i><br/><i>RP: So let's pretend I speak French.</i><br/><i>GP: Decolletage.]</i><br/><br/>Ruby leaned forward in her low-cut peasant blouse. She had long gloves covering both arms, but Carlu made a point of kissing the wooden left arm. "Do not be self-conscious," he said. "My mother has only one arm."<br/><br/>"I'm sorry to hear that," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Don't worry. She lost it while garroting a French policeman to death. Now, <i>bella signora e signore soldato</i>, how can I help you?"<br/><br/>"There is a man on this island who we have personal business with," said Ruby. "He's interrupted some of our more altruistic operations across the sea--"<br/><br/>"Then he's doing the right thing. Always look out for number one, that's the first rule of altruism."<br/><br/>Ruby managed to trudge back into the conversation. "We just want to thank him for this. Personally."<br/><br/>"I see. So this isn't a purchase of, shall we call them <i>mechanical parts</i>. You're looking for mechanics, I presume?"<br/><br/>"Yes. This meeting has two purposes. The first is that we wouldn't want to insult you by doing anything in this city that would harm your endeavors."<br/><br/>"This is wise. I'd hate to have to put a bullet in your beautiful face."<br/><br/>"Thank you. You're not the first to tell me that and I hope you won't be the last. The second purpose is to get our mechanics."<br/><br/>"We can work something out, if it doesn't cross our lines of operations."<br/><br/>"Understood. We just want to accomplish our purpose and then leave."<br/><br/>"May I ask who is the target of your latest charitable donation?"<br/><br/>"Se\xf1or Donovan," put in Geronimo.<br/><br/>"I see," said Carlu. "This will be expensive, but surely we can be of service." He smirked.<br/><br/>Ruby could tell that Carlu wasn't being honest with him. Were the Corsicans mixed up with Donovan? It worried her that he hadn't told them outright.<br/><br/><i>[Assess Honesty spend by RP.]</i><br/><br/>"I have a number of trustworthy associates," continued Carlu. "Leave it to me."<br/><br/>They managed to extricate themselves from the cafe without making any agreements. "We can't trust him," said Ruby. "They're connected to Donovan for sure. My guess is that he pays them a lot to not mention his name."<br/><br/>Geronimo sighed. "Time for plan B," he said.<br/><br/>"What's Plan B?"<br/><br/>"Nando. I need to send a cable to Istanbul."<br/><br/><i>[And so we created Fernando Montoya, Spanish merc, former untrustworthy companion of Geronimo who was now running a mercenary company in Turkey...]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>With his contacts, it was no problem for Jimmy to get tickets to the opera. Getting into Donovan's box would prove more difficult.<br/><br/>"Sorry, old man, even you can't twist my arm that much," said a Colonel of his acquaintance.<br/><br/>"<i>Mais non, c'est impossible!I</i>" said one of his old friends from Paris.<br/><br/>"<i>Non, non, e impossibile!</i>" said a local Italian businessman who had "operations" in Los Angeles.<br/><br/>Thus it was that, dressed in his best evening clothes, Jimmy arrived at the operahouse with no plan other than his usual reliance on his own abilities. As always, this was his best design.<br/><br/>"I'm Mr. Donovan's guest," he said to an usher. "Running late." He slipped a twenty pound note into the man's hand, and smiled his most confident and reassuring smile.<br/><br/><i>[Reassurance spend by Jimmy.]</i><br/><br/>"This way, signore."<br/><br/>"I'd prefer you not tell him I'm here, I'd like to surprise him."<br/><br/>"I assure you, signore, we are always <i>extremely</i> discreet about signore Donovan's guests."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451604/#Comment_451604" name="Item_237" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-23T16:54:22+00:00" title="February 23, 2016  4:54PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XIII: The Man Who Sold the World (Part 6)</b><br/><br/>Montgomery Donovan, local <i>eminence grise</i> and the opera's greatest patron smiled tightly as he walked to his box, trailed by his bodyguards and the usual coterie of brown-nosing apparatchiks of the opera. He was a tallish man in his fifties, with a face that had gracefully made the transition from <i>handsome</i> to <i>distinguished</i>. His hair was receding a little but had just the right touch of grey to make co-eds with daddy issues swoon. He walked with the supremely confident gait of a man with nothing to fear, an engineer who held all the levers of the people he met. Despite this, he didn't come off as smug, exactly; perhaps it was the hint of steel that he kept hidden behind his velvety facade.<br/><br/><i>[With James Mason as Montgomery Donovan!]</i><br/><br/>An usher opened the door to his private box--located just off of center, in the acoustically most perfect spot on the Grand Tier--and, as was his custom, strode in before his bodyguards could check the space. It wasn't courage, so much as an Olympian arrogance.<br/><br/>There was a flash of light from the darkest corner of the box. In the flare of a lighter, Donovan saw Jimmy Wright ignite his cigarette and take a long puff, the tip glowing a deep, bruised red.<br/><br/>"Ah, Mr. Wright," said Donovan. "I hadn't expected to see you so soon. Are you a fan of Verdi?"<br/><br/>"Yeah. I haven't been to the opera in a while."<br/><br/>"More's the pity."<br/><br/>Jimmy kicked a chair and it slid across the floor and came to a rest near Donovan's knee. "Have a seat," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>Donovan sat. "I hope to wrap up our business here quickly. What is it that you want to say to me?"<br/><br/>"Nothing."<br/><br/>"Indeed?"<br/><br/>"Nothing."<br/><br/>"You've come such a far way."<br/><br/>"Just here to repay the favor."<br/><br/>Donovan's men reached into their coats. "That's not necessary," Jimmy said coolly. "I like to think myself a better man than you."<br/><br/>He stood up. "I'll be seeing you soon."<br/><br/>"Mr Wright," said Donovan, not getting up. "If you do wish to speak to me, I would be very happy to have you as my guest tomorrow at a small restaurant I happen to be part owner of. Come alone, of course."<br/><br/>"Of course."<br/><br/>"Shall we say one, then? Excellent." Donovan turned to face the stage. "Good-bye, Mr. Wright," he said without turning around as Jimmy slipped out of the box.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Geronimo and Ruby went down to the waterfront to a despicable sailor's bar. Geronimo pushed aside one of the derelicts passed out at the bar and they sat themselves down at it. Ruby ordered some red wine that turned out to be vile beyond imagining. <br/><br/>Nando walked in. He looked every inch the stereotypical mercenary captain, from his epauletted khaki shirt to the three days' growth of beard crawling up his face to the sunglasses he wore beneath a battered peaked cap. He slid over to the bar and sat down in front of them.<br/><br/>"Geronimo, I was so intrigued to receive your message. What were your last words to me? 'Die, you mercenary son of a bitch, I hope never to see you again'?"<br/><br/>"Life has taken many turns. I have need of your particular skills."<br/><br/>"So I gathered from your cable. What kind of a crew do you need? You're not crazy enough to go back to Spain, are you?"<br/><br/>"No, unfortunately that would mean suicide."<br/><br/>"Except that you are so devout, I wouldn't put that past you."<br/><br/>"I see that you still have not accepted the will of God in your life."<br/><br/>"I seem to be doing very well without it, so I plan to ride that hot streak. And who is the charming Se\xf1ora?"<br/><br/>"Ruby," said Ruby. She had made a point of leaving her prosthetic exposed.<br/><br/>"<i>Enchant\xe9</i>, Ruby." Nando kissed her hand. Geronimo grimaced. "So what is the mission? And I cannot help but notice you are not wearing a wedding ring. Forgive me...se\xf1orita."<br/><br/>"I sold it," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"We need six men," said Geronimo. "The most cunning and stealthy."<br/><br/>"Ah, my specialists," said Nando, pulling out a small ledger.<br/><br/>"We have need to infiltrate a specific location."<br/><br/>"Half a dozen of my best special operations people. That's not cheap, you know."<br/><br/>"Money is not an object," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"You sure? I need a lot of it."<br/><br/><i>[Bargain and Flattery spends by Ruby (Flattery because Nando doesn't want to help Geronimo), and Streetwise by Geronimo.

Yes, private guy, you never see him. I think he gets his groceries delivered from a place down the block," said the cafe owner.<br/><br/>"Sure, we deliver to him," said the grocer. "Mostly it's his maid who comes by to place the order. No, I don't know much about her, she lives with him. I think she goes to the taverna near the square on her night off..."<br/><br/>"Mathilde?" said the tavernkeeper. "Sure, I know her, she comes in once a week at least.

The restaurant Donovan had invited him to was on the first floor above the ground floor of an exclusive club catering to Valletta's businessmen. He was quietly ushered into the dining room, which was almost empty. The chairs were still upside-down on top of the tables. A trumpeter was warming up behind the dance floor; other than him, there were only five or six men that Jimmy immediately identified as some of Donovan's torpedoes.<br/><br/>One of them, a smooth character with a pencil mustache, met Jimmy as he came in. "Mr. Wright. You're expected. Mr. Donovan is waiting for you on the terrace." He swept out his arm, indicating a pair of French doors at the far end of the room. Jimmy walked out through them and stepped onto the terrace.<br/><br/>It was a smallish balcony, only able to hold five or six little cabaret-style tables, with a heavy stone balustrade enclosing it. It jutted out over the street, although there was almost no traffic in the hot noonday sun. Donovan was sitting at a table near the edge, smoking, a glass of juice with ice in front of him. His posture was relaxed and he didn't so much as glance at Jimmy. Two goons stopped Jimmy as he came through the doorway and gave him a brisk, professional frisking. One of them relieved him of the big .45 automatic he carried in his shoulder holster. Luckily they missed the small, flat Colt .38 he had tucked into his shorts and taped against the small of his back.<br/><br/><i>[Conceal Test by JP.]</i><br/><br/>The goons stepped inside the restaurant and closed the doors behind them. Jimmy sat down across from Donovan, who swung his gaze down from the tall steeple of the 17th century church across the street to look at Jimmy. Behind him some ancient Roman tower loomed over the rooftops a few blocks away.<br/><br/>"Mr. Wright. So glad you could take the time to meet with me. I suppose I owe you an apology for the incident in India. You understand of course that it was just business."<br/><br/>"Bad business."<br/><br/>"What can I do for you, Mr. Wright? Can we not agree to just leave things as they are here?"<br/><br/>"No," drawled Jimmy. "I can't abide these affairs. I can't abide the drugs, I can't abide the corruption and the violence."<br/><br/>Donovan took a sip of his juice. "Are you a rich man, Mr. Wright?"<br/><br/>"I suppose."<br/><br/>"I can offer you a great deal of money, you know."<br/><br/>"Money doesn't matter."<br/><br/>"I didn't think it would, to you. In some ways you remind me a bit of my father. I did not really have a chance to know him before he was murdered. A fascinating man. Mathematician by trade--and also the head of one of the larger criminal networks of Europe. I was his illegitimate child, so I had very few chances to meet him."<br/><br/>"I was the black sheep of my family too."<br/><br/>"But so that you know," said Donovan, leaning forward and putting out his cigarette, "it took me forty years, but I found his killer. By that time he was a pathetic old man, marooned in Kent, trying to live out a quiet retirement. And despite the fact that he probably had but months to live, I made sure he died in front of me."<br/><br/>Donovan picked up his glass and put it on top of the stone balustrade. "You see, Mr. Wright," he said. "You're very extravagant with the lives of your people."<br/><br/>Jimmy looked at the glass of juice, sweating moisture along its sides. He began to push himself out of his chair. The glass exploded, sending crystal shards scattering in all directions, drenching him with a fine spray of juice. <i>How odd</i>, Jimmy thought, calmly somehow, the analytic part of his brain taking over even as he felt himself thrown backwards at the wall. Blood splattered against it, a fresh red bloom that he could not but somehow admire for its floral beauty and symmetry. He sat down heavily in the corner.<br/><br/>Something red began to soak through the front of his shirt.<br/><br/>"So terribly rude to have to end things this way," said Donovan, leaning over Jimmy. "But at least this way, you don't have to attend their funerals."<br/><br/>Donovan turned and began walking into the restaurant. Jimmy rolled over onto his side, grunting in pain, and ripped the Colt out from under his jacket. His hands and the gun were slick with blood.<br/><br/>"You watched the old man die?" he said through a grimace. "You should know I'm not dying <i>until you're dead</i>."<br/><br/>He fired wildly with the Colt, shattering panes of glass in the French doors with slugs from the little pistol. Several slammed home into Donovan's back and legs. Donovan cried out and slumped forward, into the waiting arms of one of his bodyguards. The doors slammed shut and curtains fell down across them. Jimmy could hear the charming sound of shotgun shells being racked from behind the doors.<br/><br/><i>[Quick anatomy of this scene, which I had imagined for a while. I gave JP a Sense Trouble roll here, which kept the sniper from scoring triple damage on Jimmy; he took 8 points of damage, which isn't even enough to put him negative (the blood was trappings.) Then Jimmy used his Ammo cherry and spent Firearms in advance to do extra damage, this worked out (since JP spent enough to hit automatically) 2d6 + 6. He did 15 points, enough damage to send Donovan to Seriously Wounded, but not dead.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy rolled back into a sitting position. Somewhere out there was a sniper with a bead on him; if he poked his head up, he'd get a bullet in the brains for his troubles. He fished into his pocket and took out a small hand mirror.<br/><br/><i>[Preparedness roll by Jimmy.]</i><br/><br/><i>Where are you?</i> he thought. His eyes ran across the houses opposite the restaurant. <i>Not them</i>, he thought, <i>I'd have heard the report of the gun.</i> He looked at the steeple and shook his head, and then fixed his eyes on the old Roman tower.<br/><br/><i>There you are</i>, he thought, catching a glint of sunlight from near the top. He carefully brought the mirror up in one hand. He had one chance at this...<br/><br/>He stood up quickly, waving the mirror towards the tower. Sunlight flashed brilliantly off of it. In one smooth motion, he took a step and jumped up onto the balustrade. Not stopping, he leaped again, landing on the balcony of an apartment building next door. He rolled through the doorway into the cool darkness of the room behind him seconds before a rifle bullet slammed into the place where he had been.<br/><br/>He got up with a groan. A man was sitting in an armchair with a newspaper spread out in front of him, a cigarette dangling from his gaping mouth as he stared at the gore-covered man in front of him with surprise.<br/><br/>"Thanks," said Jimmy, and he dashed through the front door of the apartment. <br/><br/><i>[Outdoorsman spend by JP pegged the sniper, and then a hell of an Athletics roll got him a graceful leap onto the balcony next door.]</i><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451650/#Comment_451650" name="Item_239" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-25T15:53:54+00:00" title="February 25, 2016  3:53PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XIII: The Man Who Sold the World (Part 8)</b><br/><br/>As Millicent watched Donovan's house, two cars came tearing through the streets and squealed to a stop in front of it. Several men in dark suits jumped out of the cars, and soon they carried the unconscious body of a man she was pretty sure was Donovan himself into the house. A few minutes later another car pulled up and a dignified man carrying a Gladstone bag hurried into the building.<br/><br/>Millicent went to the local grocery and bought a couple of bags of groceries. She walked nonchalantly down the alleyway next to Donovan's house, pushed open the door at the end of it, and stepped into his kitchen.<br/><br/>A young woman in a maid's uniform and an older woman wearing an apron were embracing in the middle of the kitchen, murmuring in Italian to each other. As Millicent heaved her bags of groceries onto the counter, the cook looked up and said sharply, "There's no deliveries scheduled for today...is there? I don't know, everything has gone to hell!"<br/><br/>"<i>Il patron</i>," sobbed the maid. The cook embraced her again and made comforting noises. Millicent took advantage of their distraction and slipped into the house proper.<br/><br/><i>[MP got a 10 on her Stealth check and as I generally believe in "let it ride", that was good for a whole host of infiltration.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Geronimo and Ruby, having concluded their business with Fernando, took advantage of their circumstances to make a long, slow walk back to the hotel, traversing the nicer parts of the old city on their way. Ruby felt herself relaxing for the first time since they had found the bomb on their plane; here they could look like an ordinary tourist couple, perhaps a pair of young honeymooners here to enjoy the beautiful, pure white Mediterranean sunshine, the fishy smells of the harbor, the multilingual music of the speech of crowds around them, the softness of the breezes.<br/><br/>A car came careening towards them, weaving from side to side, barely missing sideswiping a motorcyclist who sped off trailing a rich m\xe9lange of Italian curses. The car shuddered, gunned its engine, and came to a grinding stop directly in front of them, its front wheels over the curb.<br/><br/>Astonished, they looked down and saw Jimmy, covered in blood, behind the wheel. "Get in," he growled.<br/><br/>"Move over!" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"I'm fine! Get in the car!"<br/><br/>"James," said Geronimo, "Passenger seat."<br/><br/>"Just get in and when we're a safe distance away you can take the wheel."<br/><br/>Geronimo sighed and crossed to the passenger side while Ruby got in the back. Jimmy savagely ground the gears and sped off in the direction of their hotel.<br/><br/>As they approached it, they saw a traffic sawhorse blocking the entrance to the nice square their hotel overlooked. A man in a police uniform waved them down. "<i>Non e possibile</i>," he said. "Road closed, mac."<br/><br/>Jimmy backed them up about thirty feet and put on the parking brake. "No way that was a cop," he said to Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Agreed."<br/><br/>"<i>I am the man I used to be</i>," muttered Jimmy. "I won't run him over. You take the wheel."<br/><br/>He slid over as Geronimo swung into the driver's seat. The Spaniard revved the engine with the brake still engaged, then released it while jamming down the clutch. The car shot forward and obliterated the sawhorse. The man in the cop uniform leaped out of the way as they skidded into the square, clipping a four hundred year old fountain on the way.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They could see smoke billowing out from the second floor of the hotel--the same floor where their rooms were. As they drove up, the sound of shotgun blasts echoed through the square, and a couple of men in the ill-fitting suits that screamed mafiosi to them fired off a few rounds with their sawed-off shotguns. The driver's side window shattered and the front windshield starred with impact, but Geronimo kept moving forward.<br/><br/><i>[3 points of damage, but this was more about using up luck than anything physical.]</i><br/><br/>Suddenly, even over the roar of the engine and the barks of the shotguns they heard a man's voice bellowing "<i>Ka mate, ka mate! Ka ora! Ka ora!</i>" For the briefest of moments everyone stared in wonder up at the second floor of the hotel.<br/><br/>"That's Charlie!" said Ruby. "It's a war cry he knows! He told me he would only shout it when his death was near!"<br/><br/>"We have to get inside!" said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Take out the door! They're not structural!" said Jimmy. "Trust me, I know how to drive into buildings."<br/><br/><i>[Architecture spend for Jimmy to finally get his revenge against buildings.]</i><br/><br/>The car sped forward, smashing into the revolving doors with a horrible crash. It raced into the lobby in a cloud of dust and wood splinters, the tires exploding under them as the car skidded forward and came to a rest at the foot of the Grand Staircase.<br/><br/><i>[Everyone took 4 points of Health damage and the car was destroyed.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy hobbled out of the car. He glanced around at the ruins of the lobby. Before they had turned it into an impromptu garage it had been a shabby-genteel kind of place, with ratty old sofas with faded gilt detailing in the center of the room, a few racks of postcards, and the one touch that remained of the hotel's faded glory years: a large staircase that swept a stately, red-carpeted progress up to the good rooms on the second floor. It had crystal lamps spaced out along the balustrade and reproductions of religious paintings from the 17th and 18th century hanging along it. Now everything looked grim and surreal, with heavy grey dust sifting down through the air, turning the light from the large windows on the left side of the room yellow and sickly.<br/><br/>The body of one of the gangsters was crushed beneath the remains of their car. Jimmy stepped over the body without a look and began making his agonizing ascent of the staircase. He was carrying the gear shift handle from the car--it had wrenched free in the crash.<br/><br/>Geronimo spilled out of the driver's seat. He saw a flash of movement from his side of the staircase, but no target presented itself. "Ruby!" he shouted. "Follow Jimmy! I'll cover you both." He heard Ruby racing up the stairs while he swiveled his big Russian automatic around the room, slowly backing up the stairs.<br/><br/><i>[Athletics spends--2 points for Jimmy, 1 for Ruby--to climb the stairs quickly. Then a Sense Trouble roll for Geronimo...]</i><br/><br/>Something crunched by the railing of the staircase. He whirled around and saw one of the Corsicans leveling a sawed-off shotgun, clearly drawing a bead on Ruby. Without even thinking, Geronimo put two rounds in the man's head. His shotgun tumbled down and rolled to a stop at Geronimo's feet. The Spaniard picked it up and swiveled around to cover the entrance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451694/#Comment_451694" name="Item_240" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-29T17:21:00+00:00" title="February 29, 2016  5:21PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XIII: The Man Who Sold the World (Part 9)</b><br/><br/>Ruby and Jimmy reached the top of the stairs. Ruby threw a glance back down them when she heard Geronimo shooting, but once she saw he was still standing she turned to follow Jimmy.<br/><br/>They slowly came around the right-hand turn into the corridor that led to their suites. It was maybe thirty feet long; there were no other doors lining it, just the single door directly at the end of the hall that led to their room. False pillars bulged out of the wall every ten feet or so, breaking up the lines of the space and providing a place for the sconces to hang.<br/><br/>At the end of the hallway, heaped up in front of the door, they saw two corpses wearing the same bad suits. Their necks had been horribly slashed, probably by a vicious broad-bladed weapon. Two men carrying knives, one with a wicked-looking scar along his jawline, were crouched on either side of the door, which they could see had several large holes in it--Jimmy recognized them as having been made by a shotgun at close range. As they watched, the two men along the door seemed to draw in their breath (or their courage) and rushed through the doorway, vanishing into their suite.<br/><br/>Further up the hall, flattened behind the false pillars, were another two of the Corsicans. One had brown hair cut in a bowl-shaped fringe, the other had auburn-red hair. They both were carrying sawed-off shotguns, and focusing their attention on the door.<br/><br/>Jimmy gave a growl he had dragged all the way from the east African plains and ran forward, clubbing his gear shift handle in his fists. Gasping, Ruby ran behind him, firing off a snapshot at the brown-haired man on her left with her ladylike Colt .25. She caught him square in the middle of the chest and he slumped back against the wall, dropping his shotgun--but he also managed to shout out, "Rosso! Attenzione!"<br/><br/>The redhead spun around and saw Jimmy just in time to slightly duck the savage blow the detective struck him with his makeshift cudgel. Blood sprayed from the ruins of his nose, but he managed to get an arm up and ward off a second blow. With a grunt, he shoved into the American.<br/><br/>Jimmy slammed up against the wall and felt Rosso's stiletto slide into his guts. "Ahhh..." he sighed and slid to the floor. The hall began to fade to grey.<br/><br/><i>[Ruby took out her guy with a good shot, but while Jimmy took his target negative, he made his consciousness roll and stayed up on his feet long enough to get a good one in.]</i><br/><br/>For a moment, Jimmy thought about staying where he was and letting Death finally take him. It would be so easy to give up now, to let down his burden at last. Then he heard a high-pitched shriek from beyond the door. It sounded like Betty.<br/><br/><i>If the man I was can't stop them</i>, he thought, <i>then I'll become a different man</i>. As Rosso turned around to face Ruby, his knife dripping blood, Jimmy summoned up all his strength and stood up. He grabbed the redhead from behind, wrapped his arms around the man's head, and quickly and cleanly broke his neck.<br/><br/><i>[And Jimmy challenges his "I'm still the man I was" Value, refreshing health, and uses Scuffling to take out Rosso.]</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451703/#Comment_451703" name="Item_241" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-01T15:42:41+00:00" title="March  1, 2016  3:42PM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XIII: The Man Who Sold the World (Part 10)</b><br/><br/>Millicent climbed up the servant's stairs in Donovan's townhouse. She popped her head up above a landing in time to see the man she guessed was a doctor come out of room at the end of the hall. She had a glimpse of a prostrate man spread out on a bed with a bag of blood suspended next to him before the door closed and she ducked down below the landing.<br/><br/>She heard a woman's voice. "Well, what's his condition, doctor?" She had a rich, Georgian accent that Millicent recognized all too well.<br/><br/>"Madam, it is grave. He suffered several gunshot wounds to the back and legs at close range. I believe he will recover but his convalescence will be long."<br/><br/>"We'll keep you on call," said Bethany Mae. "How's the young boy?"<br/><br/>"I have talked to Dr. Solazzi. His condition is unchanged."<br/><br/>"And the other one? The control?"<br/><br/>"You will have to speak to my <i>colleague</i>," said the doctor dismissively. "I am sure I do not know what you plan for him. Good day, madam."<br/><br/>Millicent turned and ran back down the stairs. She shot through the kitchen and down the alley. A chauffeur shouted something in Italian at her, but she loped away without incident.<br/><br/><i>[In certain cases I like to differentiate between Fleeing and Athletics. This was one of them; a successful check of either would get Millicent away, but Fleeing would have kept her from being discovered.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>As Geronimo backed up the stairs, a couple of men with shotguns clambered over the ruins of the front door. One had hair as black as the robes of Death, and the other was incongruously blonde haired. Geronimo emptied both barrels into the chest of the black-haired man, leaving it a shattered ruin. He immediately rolled to his left but felt white-hot needles in his leg as Biondo pegged him with his own scattergun. He pulled himself up by the railing of the staircase and reached for his pistol.<br/><br/><i>[Nine points of damage to one thug, but the other did 4 points to Geronimo, dropping him to -1]</i><br/><i></i><br/>Biondo climbed the stairs. He threw his shotgun away and drew his stiletto. Geronimo tried to level his pistol, and then fired off several rounds. One of the lamps shattered. A flower pot exploded in a cloud of dirt. A few shots ricocheted at the blonde man's feet. But none struck home.<br/><br/>Grinning, Biondo stabbed Geronimo in the chest quickly, over and over.<br/><br/><i>[Geronimo did damage, but not enough to put Biondo negative. Then he did 3 points to Geronimo, dropping him to -4]</i><br/><i></i><br/>Geronimo slumped down as Biondo threw him into the railing. He had been close to death before now, but never in circumstances as bad as this. He took a ragged breath and closed his eyes, trying to summon up the images of his faith that had always calmed him: the huge wooden crucifix hanging in the mountain chapel of his youth, the smell of incense on Christmas morning, the glory of light streaming through a stained-glass image of Our Lady he had seen once in a cathedral.<br/><br/>But those images did not come. Instead, he saw Ruby at a party in a dress that gleamed golden in the dim light; the scent that tickled his nose with a sudden sharp shock of memory was not incense but the delicate jasmine scent she favored in the summer; and it was not the Holy Mother he saw but Ruby, in the Greek isles, wearing a flowing white dress, her red hair streaming behind her in the brilliant sunshine, the air translucent, the sea so deep blue around them...<br/><br/>His crucifix slipped from bloody fingers. Biondo was leaning over him. "I'm going to make you smile, pretty boy," he said, and then raised his knife to stab Geronimo in the heart. The Spaniard caught the man's wrist as it came down, and twisted it roughly. "The only one smiling will be you," he growled, and then shoved the inverted knife into Biondo's chest.<br/><br/>The Corsican staggered back and fell down. He crawled over to his shotgun, stiletto still sticking out of his sides. He cracked the gun open and tried to reload it with trembling, bloody fingers.<br/><br/>Geronimo walked up to him and kicked him the face, snatching away the shotgun as he did. He raised the gun up in his fists and brought it down on Biondo's head as hard as he could. Gore splattered everywhere, splashing across a painting of the Madonna and Child behind the Corsican. Geronimo's shadow loomed hugely in the dim yellow light. For a second, as he raised the shotgun a second time, it almost looked as if he was carrying a cross on his shoulders.<br/><br/>Then he brought it down with all his force onto the head of his enemy.<br/><br/><i>[Geronimo challenges his "My faith is strong" Value; the telenovela and religious imagery came out of our table talk, and the fact that it was Ruby he saw instead of Jesus at the moment of his death came out of discussions GP and I had during a break.</i><br/><br/><i>At this point, I felt the Values system was a qualified success.

The first thing they saw was Charlie, stretched out on the floor, a stiletto sticking out of his heart. Just beyond him was the body of one of the mobsters, a bloody kukri shoved in his throat at a loathsome angle.<br/><br/>In the center of the room, Betty was lying on the floor, with two more Corsicans pinning her down spread-eagle beneath them. One was the man with the scar they had seen enter the room before. He was holding Betty's head down, face to the door, with one hand while with the other he was readying a knife to slash her throat out.<br/><br/>Jimmy moved across the room. Without breaking stride, he snatched up the kukri with one hand as he approached Betty. Her eyes grew wide as Jimmy reached out, grabbed Scar on the shoulder, and pulled him around to face him.<br/><br/>"Hey," he said and chopped down savagely at the man's neck, nearly severing his head  from the his body.<br/><br/>The other Corsican stood up, but Ruby drilled him in the head with her pistol.<br/><br/>"Boss, we put Janet in the bathroom like you said," croaked Betty. <br/><br/>"Take care of her," said Jimmy without turning around. He ran down the hallway toward the bathrooms.<br/><br/>Ruby sank down to her knees next to Charlie's body. His face looked peaceful, so peaceful, more tranquil than she ever remembered seeing it before. In death, his features showed his true age; she saw the deeply worn lines of grief and sorrow on them, although his mouth was crooked in the gentlest of smiles. She took one of his huge hands in her own and held it gently.<br/><br/>When Geronimo staggered into the room, she didn't get up but wrapped his legs in her arms and gave a single heaving sob.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>The door to the bathroom was locked, Jimmy threw his broad shoulder into it twice, and it cracked down the middle. He pushed hard again and the door flew open.<br/><br/>He saw Janet lying by the bathtub, in a pool of blood. She raised up arms slick with blood. Her wrists had been slashed. <br/><br/>The Mouth was singing a wordless chant of misery and exultation.<br/><br/>"I thought they were going to kill me, so I thought I'd do it myself," she said woozily. Jimmy bound her wrists with a couple of towels and swept her up in his arms.<br/><br/>He came into the living room. Geronimo had put Betty into a fireman's carry. "James, the police," he said. Sirens were already audible.<br/><br/>"They'll be looking for us. Let's get out of here," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>They stumbled down the fire stairs and into the alley behind the hotel. A car pulled up at the end of it, blocking their exit. The door opened and they saw Millicent behind the wheel.<br/><br/>Once they were inside and speeding away, Millicent said, "I have more bad news. Bethany Mae is here and working for Donovan."<br/><br/>Geronimo sighed. "Take us to Nando," he said.<br/><br/><i>[Stability loss was bad; 5 points for Ruby (her cap was much higher because of Charlie's death), and she lost 3 </i>Rating<i> points for losing a Solace. Jimmy took 5 as well; Geronimo was relatively untouched, only losing 3 points.</i><br/><br/><i>This sequence played out awesomely, although it was a bit of a tightrope walk; the Assess Honesty spend that Ruby and Geronimo used did tell them that the Corsicans worked for Donovan, but I did not volunteer the obvious corollary that therefore staying in a hotel they ran might be a very bad idea. (Had they moved, the Corsicans would still have attacked, but the circumstances would have been very different.) Also, the whole campaign I had been relatively...easy-going about the PCs stashing their Sources of Stability out of harm's way. I'm not saying that this was compensation for that, but certainly the shock factor of it finally happening made this encounter even more memorable. I sort of think about this as a way to simulate Monty Donovan's uber-competence and, as RP put it, "genre savviness".

As it turned out, only Charlie got marked off, although if they had been a turn slower Betty would have died as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451740/#Comment_451740" name="Item_245" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-03T15:48:30+00:00" title="March  3, 2016  3:48PM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XIII: The Man Who Sold the World (Part 12)</b><br/><br/>Nando had taken up headquarters in a decrepit poolhall. When they arrived, the owner gently ushered out the other patrons with a shotgun. "Private party," he said.<br/><br/>"You're already covered in blood," said Fernando with sang-froid. "That didn't take long."<br/><br/>"I don't need your commentary, Nando," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Sounds like you need my help."<br/><br/>"We are more than willing to pay," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"We need shelter, not sass," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Well, don't worry about this place. Nobody knows anyone's name here; it's part of the charm."<br/><br/>Geronimo commandeered one of the pool tables to use for surgery and examination. Jimmy's bullet wound had passed through him and wasn't as bad as it looked; he needed a few stitches for the knife wounds, but overall he was in relatively good shape.<br/><br/>Betty needed to have an arm set and a lot more stitches; Janet's wrist wounds were relatively superficial, fortunately, and Geronimo was able to close them up without much trouble. Millicent was an efficient little nurse, settling Janet and Betty on cots in a back room, passing out alcohol as anesthetic and disinfectant.<br/><br/>Jimmy took a moment to talk to Geronimo about Janet's condition.<br/><br/>"She has lost a lot of blood," said the Spaniard, "But worse than that, she has lost the will to live. Ruby, move the mirror over slightly." Geronimo creased his brow, and then resumed stitching the knife wounds in his side.<br/><br/>"Here is what I will tell you, my friend," continued Geronimo. "If she loses the Mouth, she has a chance of regaining her will to continue living. But as long as that Mouth stays on her...she will be suicidal. I know the amputation is a relatively high one--"<br/><br/>"And her dominant arm," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"--but it will at least give her some hope again. I can only deal with her physical wounds. You must do something about the intangible ones."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Night fell. If Ruby and Geronimo took more time treating each other's wounds and did so in a more intimate space, no one felt they had any standing to say anything. Millicent, who was the only one not wanted by the police, went out and got some comic books for Betty. She read them in a soft voice to her, while Jimmy stood by her bedside.<br/><br/>Betty reached for his hand and clutched it. "Did I do good, boss?" she whispered.<br/><br/>Jimmy smiled at her. "You always do good."<br/><br/>At dawn, Fernando came in with a stack of newspapers. "You guys made the front page," he said. "All of them. I like this headline the best. <i>I terroristi</i> has a nice ring to it, don't you think? Also, good picture of you, James. Oh, and <i>bella senorita</i>? That plane of yours, the one painted bright red? You'll be happy to know the Royal Navy has impounded it."<br/><br/>While everyone else tore into the breakfast of sweet rolls and coffee Nando had brought, Jimmy went into the back room. Betty was snoring on her cot, but Janet was awake and staring at the doorway.<br/><br/>"I thought I was in heaven this morning," she said. "Then I heard <i>It</i> talking."<br/><br/>He sat down on a stool next to her bed. "Do you trust me?"<br/><br/>"Of course, Jimmy."<br/><br/>"You know I would do anything for you. You know I will find a way to beat this."<br/><br/>"Can you beat it, Jimmy?"<br/><br/>"Yes. I can beat this. I will beat this. I just need you to hold on. Can you do that?"<br/><br/>"Yes," she said. Her eyes closed and she fell into a shallow sleep, but she was smiling for the first time in a long while.<br/><br/><i>[We did this as a simple Psychoanalysis test (plus, as it turned out, Reassurance use) in order to keep Janet's morale up. Then:</i><br/><br/><i>JP: I'd like to make a Credit Rating spend to have retroactively bought...]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy took a small box out of his jacket pocket. He opened it, and the diamond ring inside sparkled faintly in the early morning light. He slid the ring on Janet's finger and left her to rest.<br/><br/><i>[Me: (sniff) This is the happiest Credit Rating spend I've allowed in my life.]</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451784/#Comment_451784" name="Item_246" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-07T15:49:09+00:00" title="March  7, 2016  3:49PM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 7, 2016 4:06PM by Aviatrix.">edited March 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XIII: The Man Who Sold the World (Part 13)</b><br/><br/>Oh, I know. Not a dry eye in the house, right? Our bold heroes have their arcs and everyone cheers them on. And if you spare a thought toward the rest, it's only in reference to Jimmy and company, right?<br/><br/>But is that fair? Do you think that Charlie really saw himself as a sidekick? Or was this for him the last act of his tragic tale of redemption, the scarred but indomitable old warrior taking on an apprentice who could barely look out for herself? But then, when have any of you asked about the poor sap. About his own story, about why he left family and home and wandered the world, soaking up religions and philosophy into his vast, curious mind.<br/><br/>Have you forgotten that it's Watson who wrote all the Sherlock stories?<br/><br/>Makes you think. If you let it, that is. Have you spared a thought for all those faceless Corsicans your heroes just massacred? Would it change anything if you knew Matteu, the guy Jimmy nearly decapitated, was trying to avenge his father's death by working his way up the mob hierarchy, hoping to get close enough to the bosses to do them in? Or that he had a poor widowed mamma back home who depended on him? Sure, he didn't want to slash out the throat of that blonde American, or do half the horrible things he had done. But then fate didn't ask him about what he wanted when that car bomb killed his nieces, beautiful girls. It didn't ask him about what he wanted when those two corrupt gendarmes back on <i>le Corse</i>  arrested and violated his sister. So he did what he had to do to play out the game.<br/><br/>And really, haven't this little crew done their own terrible deeds? Or can't you think over the screams of Dr. Savitree?<br/><br/>Anyway. One man's heroic fantasy is another's labyrinth of death and bad choices. Sometimes they meet, and one of them ends his tale. Life is pain, after all.<br/><br/>Anyone who tells you different is probably an extra-dimensional entity getting its kicks.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Millicent set out to track down the boy that Bethany Mae had mentioned. She used her experience as a candy striper to ingratiate herself with the nurses from the nearest hospital; she found several of them gathered at a small street cafe.<br/><br/>"Master Donovan?" a pretty young nurse told her. "Oh yes, I heard about that. He's in Superbissima Hospital. I hear he's very sick."<br/><br/>"How terrible. Let me get you another cup of coffee," said Millicent. As she got up, she saw Annette motioning to her from the corner of a building. She strode inconspicuously over to her.<br/><br/>"I am so sorry," Annette whispered. "I didn't know! I had no idea about any of this! I'm sorry your freinds got killed!"<br/><br/>"Charlie did. But the rest survived. Is Bethany Mae one of yours?"<br/><br/>"I've worked with her before. She's running security for Donovan now; that just happened, some kind of reward for good service, I think."<br/><br/>"Really? But you know what that means, right? The Nectar? You know what it is?"<br/><br/>"It's not good...but it makes a lot of money."<br/><br/>"You can always steal money."<br/><br/>"Sure, I can...but there's a higher level to these things. That's what I learned from Miss A. Speaking of which, they called me in to deliver this to you."<br/><br/>She handed Millicent an envelope in a heavy, expensive cream colored paper. Inside was a note, written in an elegant old-fashioned hand:<br/><br/><i>Dear Miss Lowell,</i><br/><br/><i>If you would do me the very great honour of taking tea with me this afternoon, I shall endeavour to answer those questions concerning your heritage I am reliably informed you harbour.</i><br/><br/><i>I remain very truly yours,</i><br/><br/><i>Irene Adler</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><i>During the break, among other things we discussed where to hide all the items LSAS planned to find.<br/><br/>RP: We can bury them in abandoned mine sites, there\u2019s plenty of those in America.<br/><br/>Me: That will go over great in the 1950s. \u201cWe were digging this bomb shelter and found all these books!

Reading between the lines, Jimmy and Geronimo agreed that his reputation seemed somewhat unsavory.<br/><br/>Bethany Mae they guessed was in charge of a warehouse that Donovan had gone to enormous lengths to conceal his ownership of it. It was regularly serviced by a ship called the <i>Thyrsus</i>, which Ruby recognized as the name of a staff carried by the Maenads, the female followers of Dionysos who were known for their ecstatic, wild rituals.<br/><br/>They also met the team Nando had assembled:<br/><br/><b>Boris</b>, a hulking Russian infiltration expert.<br/><br/><b>Smythe</b>, the medic, a nervous Englishman who had lost his medical license for reasons he didn't want to discuss.<br/><br/><b>Xavier</b>, the Irish demolitions expert, a veteran of the Rising and the Irish Civil War.<br/><br/><b>Yvonne</b>, a half-Algerian, half-French sniper with experience gained in the long guerilla wars of North Africa.<br/><br/><b>Umberto</b>, another Spanish Republican, the recon and rescue specialist, known to Geronimo by reputation. "He was a wire-cutter, the one who would go between trenches to cut the barbed wire," he told Ruby.<br/><br/><b>Dallas</b>, an American ex-lawman, their weapons expert who carried an enormous collection of guns. He wasn't Texan; he got the nickname because he had killed a bunch of Texas Rangers in Dallas.<br/><br/>While everyone else pondered this, Millicent changed into something she hoped was appropriate and left for her meeting, a small pistol wedged into her garter.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Annette met her in front of the Grand Hotel Maltois, one of the best on the island. "Do I look all right?" Millicent said nervously.<br/><br/>"You look fine. This is really important to me. Try to make a good impression her."<br/><br/>They went inside and were shown by the concierge to a private parlor off of the lobby. A couple of young woman searched Millicent before she went into the room, but they missed the gun she was carrying.<br/><br/>The parlor was decorated in a mad floral explosion of Second Empire poor taste. Everything was gilded, or covered in a floral pattern or both, from the comfortable sofa against one wall to the porcelain tea set perched on a small table in front of the davenport. Sitting there was a very old woman, dressed in modest but stylish clothes.<br/><br/>"Come on in, MIllicent, please," she said. Her accent was American and had the clipped tones of an upper-class Easterner. "I've been looking forward to meeting you for a long time."<br/><br/>"Yes ma'am." Millicent sank into an overstuffed armchair Miss Adler indicated with one elegant hand.<br/><br/>"Now, my child, we have been looking for you everywhere."<br/><br/>"Why?"<br/><br/>"That's a curious story. I specialize in certain feats of, shall we say, criminal derring-do. There's nobody better than me at the long con on four continents. Never could get it to work in Australia," she said as an aside. "I was mostly retired but was asked to help out someone looking for you. She was building a mole operation, an organization concealed inside another organization, seemed like an interesting play for me. One last ride into the sunset, eh? Pray let me give you some tea. Lemon?"<br/><br/>"No ma'am."<br/><br/>Irene Adler handed her the teacup. "My client was of a mystic bent, and the quest for you involved contacts with that sort of thing. In the course of our investigation we uncovered this Nectar drug."<br/><br/>"Bethany Mae seems to like working with it."<br/><br/>"Oh, Bethany is a bright girl with a good future, if she stays dedicated. The chance to make such an enormous profit off of the Nectar was too good to pass up; and in any case, it would help me find <i>you</i>."<br/><br/>"Have you ever taken it?"<br/><br/>"Oh, heavens no. I'm not stupid enough to get addicted to my own drug. And I can tell you, it makes more money than anything I have ever been involved with in my life."<br/><br/>"It seems to do different things in different places."<br/><br/>"That's a marketing issue," said Irene with a wave of her hand. "Here in Malta we're doing the best. We have a very skilled manager, of course. Good bloodline, I worked with his father for a while, long ago. But you, child, probably have some questions."<br/><br/>"Where do I fit into all of this?"<br/><br/>"You're the focus of this cult, the Epsilon Sigma sorority we organized. They think you are the child of a god, and are necessary for the completion of their grand design. We've been looking for you all around the world. Had to go through a lot of candidates. But I knew the Nectar would help us out."<br/><br/>"How did that work?"<br/><br/>"Drew you like a fly to the investigation, didn't it? I won't say it didn't cost us anything. Our Los Angeles operation is basically not functioning; I have no idea what Samson is up to, building some mansion out in the Valley. Savitree, we were probably going to eventually lose anyway."<br/><br/>"We tried to help, but she made it so difficult..."<br/><br/>"She had unsound means."<br/><br/>Millicent put down her cup. "Do they want to kill me, the Epsilon Sigmas?"<br/><br/>"My stars, no! They think the world of you."<br/><br/>Suddenly Millicent realized that Irene's bodyguards weren't staring at her with a steely determination not to let her make a sudden move, but with a rapt attention approaching worship.<br/><br/>"I still don't quite understand this god thing," she said.<br/><br/>"God, supernatural intelligence, I don't get into the metaphysics of this thing. I took the job for my client, and it gave me a chance to tweak an old friend of mine. Friend, enemy...in any case, we took care of her. As a matter of fact, that helped me turn one of my most valuable agents."<br/><br/>"I'm not following all this, I'm afraid."<br/><br/>"Don't trouble yourself, child. An old woman rambling is all. I so rarely have a chance to talk without thinking about what I'm saying. The funny thing, though, is that you don't look like what we expect you to look like."<br/><br/>"I may have lost a little weight?"<br/><br/>"No, child, that's not close to what I mean, and I think you know that. I mean, obviously it would have been easy to just find Vanessa Brady."<br/><br/>"But she's just an ordinary woman--"<br/><br/>"I wouldn't call Vanessa an ordinary woman."<br/><br/>"Did you kidnap her?"<br/><br/>"My word, no. She came to us. With your sister."<br/><br/>"<i>What</i>?"<br/><br/>"Maybe sister isn't the right word, but again I don't trouble myself with that. I leave it to the girls."<br/><br/>"I'm so confused," said Millicent miserably.<br/><br/>"It will make more sense once you leave with us."<br/><br/>"Where are we going?"<br/><br/>"India."<br/><br/>"Now?"<br/><br/>"I'm afraid so, child."<br/><br/>"I was going to bring my friends back some cake..."<br/><br/>"If you tell me where they are," said Irene, leaning forward. "I'll be sure to deliver it to them."<br/><br/>"That's what I'm afraid of."<br/><br/>"Give it to Annette. I'm sure she'll find your friends."<br/><br/>"Probably she could. How did you meet? She thinks the world of you."<br/><br/>"She tried to rob me. Very silly thing to do, don't you think?"<br/><br/>"She probably didn't know who she was stealing from."<br/><br/>"She learned," said Irene with a rather satisfied smile. "And then I hired her. As for you, well, you represent my last obligation to Epsilon Sigma and my client; now I can manage the purely criminal aspects. I'll keep some of the girls on staff to handle the...metaphysics. It's time for you to go meet Vanessa, and your sister, and the inner circle...the priestesses of the Starry Wisdom. I wrote that down as a joke, but they decided to use it. No sense of humor. Bad as Holmes."<br/><br/>"There's something I'm trying to figure out," said Millicent. "There was a crazy woman who wanted to kill me to save the world. Was she right?"<br/><br/>"Honestly, Millicent...or should I say Mirabelle? I really don't care at all.

Jimmy was trying to keep his face from betraying his overwhelming sentiment of "I told you so."<br/><br/>"James," said Ruby. "Do you know where he is?"<br/><br/>"Well," said Jimmy. "She went to <i>tea</i>."<br/><br/>"Tea takes a couple of hours! She's still not back!"<br/><br/>"I have no idea where she is! But if she went to meet this person for answers, then she probably got knocked out and taken prisoner."<br/><br/>"Is wherever she's going bad? Yes or no?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"Is there anything we can do about it?" asked Ruby, at the exact moment that a Molotov cocktail came sailing in the room through a window.<br/><br/>"Fernando," said Geronimo. "We need vehicles."<br/><br/>"You're not kidding," said Fernando, peering out the window. "There's a lot of them. Some look like they've been shot. You guys shoot them?"<br/><br/>"Some of them," said Ruby.<br/><br/>Fernando bit his lip. "Go with Umberto. We'll draw off the rest. We have Thompsons."<br/><br/>"You need to get Betty and Janet out of here," said Geronimo. "They can't come with us."<br/><br/>"We can take them out to our boat," said Nando. "We have one in the harbor. You paid for it, after all. We can drive them out in our car--they're not looking for us, after all, and we've got the firepower to shoot our way out if we have to."<br/><br/>"I trust your skills," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Great. I'll just put this on the invoice."<br/><br/>"If anything happens to them..." began Jimmy.<br/><br/>"This thing that happened in the paper," said Fernando. "Did it happen, and did you do it?"<br/><br/>Jimmy nodded curtly.<br/><br/>"I'll personally make sure they're unharmed," said Fernando, eyes bugging slightly.<br/><br/>They were able to head out the back of the burning building and up the alleyway. They could hear the heavy tramp of mafiosi boots approaching to cut them off. Jimmy, Ruby, and Geronimo sprinted up the alleyway, followed by Umberto. They dashed out before they could be intercepted and ran as fast as they could into the maze of buildings along the waterfront, pursued by six very angry Corsicans.<br/><br/>Jimmy pulled up and emptied his clip rapidly at their pursuers, causing them to scatter for cover, then turned to follow Geronimo.<br/><br/><i>[JP used the Ammo cherry to do suppressive fire to open up some daylight between them.]</i><br/><br/>"Where do we go?" said Geronimo to Umberto.<br/><br/>"There's a little square up ahead where we might be able to shake them. But we need to go quietly from now on."<br/><br/>True to his word, Umberto slipped into an unnatural, panther-like grace, ghosting up along the sides of the road. Geronimo followed as best he could. Jimmy simply swept up Ruby in a fireman's carry. He was tired of her high heels betraying their position.<br/><br/>They stalked into the tiny square. It was a dismal affair, a few weathered posters long out of date covering the peeling stucco walls. A small kiosk, probably a food stand of some kind, stood in the middle of the square. The lock was child's play for Jimmy and they all managed to slip inside, where they held their breaths as the sound of footsteps drew near.<br/><br/>The inside of the little kiosk was stifling. A heavy wooden shutter, probably an awning when the place was open for business, blocked off the opening above the countertop. Ruby peered through the crack between it and the counter, hoping to get a breath of air. Behind her Geronimo, Jimmy, and Umberto were having a whispered conversation about the best way to rush their attackers.<br/><br/>The Corsicans were murmuring to each other, clearly unsure as to where their quarry had gone. As Ruby stared at them, she saw something completely unexpected.<br/><br/>A man, wearing a long white surcoat with a red cross embroidered on it was walking quietly down the street behind the Corsicans. He carried an enormous Norman kite shield with a Maltese cross painted on it, seemed to be wearing actual chain mail if the coif on his head was any indication, and had a ridiculously long sword hanging from his belt. As Ruby watched, he drew his sword and charged the Corsicans. One swift blow decapitated one of the mobsters.<br/><br/>The Corsicans yelped. The...knight? ignored them and made a fancy inside-out move with his sword, slashing another one of them and dropping him.<br/><br/>"Geronimo," said Ruby, "Reality isn't fair. It keeps throwing strange at you, and when you really need to just be normal, knights come down the street murdering people."<br/><br/>"What?" said Geronimo, trying to peer out with Ruby.<br/><br/>"Quiet, maybe he's on our side!" hissed Jimmy.<br/><br/>Ruby and Geronimo watched as one of the Corsicans tried to rush the knight. He got the shield in his face for his troubles, and skidded to the cobblestones with blood pouring out of his broken nose. The knight flipped his sword around and stabbed his prostrate attacker. Another of the mobsters took the opportunity that afforded to jump on the warrior's back. The knight rolled his shoulders and flipped his grappler to the ground. He got the sword as well.<br/><br/>"He's kind of old," said Ruby. "Look how grey his beard is."<br/><br/>The remaining two Corsicans turned and ran away in panic. The old knight sheathed his sword, reached with his right hand into the straps binding his shield to his left arm, and retrieved a huge .45 revolver. He fired six quick shots into the backs of the fleeing men, dropping them dead to the ground.<br/><br/>With a heavy tread, the knight began walking to the kiosk, sword drawn once again. He pounded on the door with the pommel of his sword. Jimmy opened the door a crack.<br/><br/>"Hi," he said. "That was really impressive--"<br/><br/>The knight held up one hand. "Come with me if you want a place to hide," he said, and then turned away.<br/><br/>"Let's go," said Jimmy. Umberto and Geronimo looked at each other and shrugged, then followed after Jimmy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451817/#Comment_451817" name="Item_254" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-10T18:00:23+00:00" title="March 10, 2016  6:00PM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XIII: The Man Who Sold the World (Part 16)</b><br/><br/>The old man took them through narrow alleys they might not have even suspected existed had he not shown them the way. He seemed to have an intimate, encyclopedic knowledge of the hidden ways of Valletta. After a long, slow trudge, they came in site of the desolate ruin of an ancient church on a bluff overlooking the harbor. The old man lead them around behind this edifice and into a cave that yawned below its foundations.<br/><br/>They followed him through ancient dusty chambers of stone, catacombs perhaps; they saw tombs and flagstones engraved with illegible names and dates. One room off of the main corridor was well-lit (in contrast to the dim or no light they had encountered so far) but it provided little comfort because it was so unusual. Inside the room they could see, as they filed past, an effigy tomb--but the statue carved on the lid was no Crusader knight, but an American cowboy in full regalia, his Stetson carved with supreme delicacy from marble.<br/><br/>Finally the entered a large room with thick ceiling beams. A few lanterns hung from them, casting a feeble illumination that was enough to reveal a couple of large trestle tables, and some faint frescoes in a medieval style painted on the walls--knights, mostly, or coats of arms.<br/><br/>"This looks like the Temple of the White Buddha," muttered Jimmy.<br/><br/>The old man unfastened his shield and hung it on a rack bolted to the wall. He regarded the Maltese cross with a frown. "Forgive the deception," he said. "This was once a chapel of the Knights Hospitaller, vulgarly called the Knights of Malta. I have adopted it for my own ends. It suited my order's purposes at one time."<br/><br/>"Who are you?" everyone said more or less in unison.<br/><br/>"My name is Sir Godfrey Welles. I am the Grand Master of the Order of the Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon, in exile."<br/><br/>"The <i>Templars</i>?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Jimmy Wright," said Jimmy, holding out his hand.<br/><br/>Sir Godfrey did not take it. "I know who you are, Mr. Wright."<br/><br/>"We thought your order was extinct," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Yes. It was intended that the world should think that. What is not commonly known is that the Pope rescinded all the charges of heresy against the Order and its leaders, although many of them ended up being martyred by the cruel flames of that great hypocrite and apostate, Phillip IV, King of France. We survived, though, hidden inside the other orders, inside the Hospitallers. Here, in our secret base, in Malta." He looked at their stunned faces.<br/><br/><i>[That bit about the Pope was true, although it only has been proven by recent scholarship; look up the Chinon parchment for details.]</i><br/><br/>"You have many questions," he said. <br/><br/>"Yeah... we...uh..." said Ruby.<br/><br/>"We're still processing," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"You are here because you fight the great evil," said Sir Godfrey. "The one who Lies. There are many evils in this world and the Knights Templar have struggled against them. There is the one who comes from Egypt, the black man, Nyarlathotep. We have fought against him."<br/><br/>Jimmy tried not to spit at the mention of the name.<br/><br/>"This one, the Liar," continued Sir Godfrey, "this is a very serious matter. My order has struggled for centuries against it."<br/><br/>"We know," said Jimmy. "We saw the signs in Bangkok."<br/><br/>"The Temple of the White Buddha? Then you are following in the footsteps of Ramon Echevarr\xeda."<br/><br/>"Yes," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"I thought someone might. And yet you seem to fight against this being--or have I made a mistake?" he said, grasping for his sword.<br/><br/>"Why are you so surprised we are fighting against it?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Ramon sought to gain power from this being, and yet you follow his path."<br/><br/><i>[Me to my cat at this point: You are not allowed on the table when Mommy is monologuing.]</i><br/><br/>"You can't find out how to stop him without knowing where he has been," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Fair point. But as Mr. Cuevas knows, one must be careful when you tread in the footsteps of Satan. However...knowing you are led by him, a man I have heard much about, a true warrior of God..."<br/><br/>Geronimo stared at the old knight, his soul tortured by his recent loss of faith. "Yes," he said as humbly as he could.<br/><br/>"My Order has studied this foe for centuries. What may I tell you about it?"<br/><br/>"Will destroying the Final Mouth destroy all the other Mouths?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"No. The Final Mouth has some mystic significance that is somewhat unclear to me. I do believe that if the Liar is destroyed, then all the Mouths will die, since It is their body."<br/><br/>"Is the Final Mouth the Liar?"<br/><br/>"No. The Liar's body lies beneath a specific location on Earth."<br/><br/>"Where?"<br/><br/>"Underneath Mount Kailash, in Thibet. My Order visited it long ago." He unrolled a long illuminated scroll with miniatures of knights climbing a mountain and then descending inside it.<br/><br/>"Is there snow there?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Yes, it is a high mountain in the Himalayas."<br/><br/>"We may have accidentally been there," mused Jimmy, remembering the second place the Pyramid of the Xoxul had carried them to.<br/><br/>"There is a ritual you can use to make the way into the mountain clear. You must be on the summit, of course...but it will lead you into the underworld the Liar inhabits, which is not quite a place of this world and yet not apart from it. The parchment containing the ritual has been lost--or should I say, stolen. By Montgomery Donovan."<br/><br/>"I recently put some bullets in his back."<br/><br/>"I would normally not condone such an unchivalrous act, but against these men, no quarter must be given, no stratagem is beyond the pale."<br/><br/>"If it makes you feel better, I allowed him to make the first move."<br/><br/>"How...gallant of you."<br/><br/><i>[MP: I know this! It means "stupid".]</i><br/><br/>"Do you know where the ritual is?"<br/><br/>"It is held inside the warehouse where they keep the Source of this vile Nectar. There is a network of tunnels beneath this cavern, dug by my Order and the Hospitallers--<i>when they had the time</i>--that can lead you to this warehouse. It is a difficult way. There are many traps. You must take some time to recover. Please make yourself at home. There are refreshments in the larder."<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451844/#Comment_451844" name="Item_255" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-14T15:07:31+00:00" title="March 14, 2016  3:07PM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XIII: The Man Who Sold the World (Part 17)</b><br/><br/>"Who is this old lunatic?" said Umberto in a hushed whisper.<br/><br/>"Remember he killed six of them by himself," said Jimmy. "Maybe I should get a sword," he said a bit louder.<br/><br/>"For you I am sure one could be found," said Sir Godfrey. "Mr. Cuevas, may I have a word in private?"<br/><br/>He led Geronimo to what had to be a chapel. He stopped the Spaniard before he could step inside. "I know you are a true soldier of God," he said. "You seek to serve Him in all ways? To do His will?"<br/><br/>"Brother," said Geronimo in a strained voice, "had you asked me this question a day ago I would have vehemently said Yes. However, I must admit my faith has begun to waver."<br/><br/>"I understand, Mr. Cuevas. My Order practices chastity, and I have tried to live by those rules. It is true...once there was one that I loved. Did I break my vows? Perhaps. Perhaps those old vows we once took before the Pope. But my belief in the Will of God was unshaken, and the one I loved was a soldier fighting against evil as well. A friend of a dear companion. The true knight's valor, Mr. Cuevas, comes not from conviction, but from the struggle against doubt. Against the forces of evil. Come with me."<br/><br/>They stepped into the chapel, which was in great disrepair. Most of the pews had been broken into splinters. The baptismal font was full of dust and dry as old bones. But the altar was quite clean, and upon it laid an immaculate sword. The blade almost seemed to shed its own light.<br/><br/>"This sword," said Sir Godfrey, "is a weapon of mystic power. For a long time it lay in the hands of the infidels. They gave it a ridiculous name, the Sword of Akmallah. In truth it is a weapon that can only be wielded by a true knight of God. In the hands of a holy warrior it is a weapon of incomprehensible strength. It will mold itself to the bearer's hand; it will make itself into the sword he desires and needs it to be. This was returned to me through the services of one you will meet shortly. I am too old to wield this weapon. My strength is fading and my struggle will be over soon. Become a knight, Geronimo! Take your vow, wield this sword against evil. Become the man you were destined to be!"<br/><br/>Geronimo hung his head, thinking only of Ruby.<br/><br/>Sir Godfrey put one hand on his shoulder. "Be of good cheer, my dear brother. There are many grades of knighthood. I do not ask that you become a monk. I sense your conflict. You will not need to do as much as once we required."<br/><br/>Geronimo nodded mutely.<br/><br/>"You must however still undergo your Vigil. This place is not like others. Many is the knight who fell asleep during his vigil and yet was just as holy a warrior. But here that cannot be; you must undergo all of what lies ahead of you. If you come out the other side, no matter what you feel, you will be worthy of carrying this weapon."<br/><br/>"What must I do?"<br/><br/>"Rest now. When it is time, I will bring you back and you will stay here, praying all night over your weapons.

She found the chapel with the effigy tomb of the cowboy, and stared at it for a long time, trying to make sense of the puzzle. She heard someone come in behind her and turned around to see who it was.<br/><br/>It was another woman. She was wearing fashionable clothes in the current style, but something of her bearing indicated she was uncomfortable in them. A pair of pince-nez hung from a chain, over a long red scarf that was wound tightly around her neck. She looked to be perhaps thirty years old. But there was something strange in the way she moved that betrayed a much greater age\u2014but nothing halting or decrepit. It suddenly and absurdly came into Ruby's mind that it was some kind of grace, some kind of incredible efficiency of movement that made her think she was older than she looked.<br/><br/>"I'm sorry," said the woman in a prim English accent. "I didn't mean to disturb you."<br/><br/>"It's all right. We haven't met yet, I believe. What is your name?"<br/><br/>"Call me M--" the other woman said quickly, as if it was a reflex. Then she caught herself. "No. My name is Mina Murray." She looked sadly down at the tomb. "That was a friend of mine,"<br/><br/>For the first time, Ruby realized that the image on the tomb was still being actively worked on--she could see the dust and the tool marks in places--as if someone had spent years, <i>decades</i> carving this memorial, alone, in the darkness...<br/><br/>"You are the people Sir Godfrey went to fetch?" said Mina.<br/><br/>"Yes. He did so quite spectacularly."<br/><br/>"That would be in character for him," she said with a wry smile. "Let us join the others, if you don't mind."<br/><br/>They walked back into the refractory. "James," said Mina when she saw Jimmy. "How nice to see you again."<br/><br/>"You know each other?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Only briefly. I mostly worked with his friend."<br/><br/>"We stumbled into each other's business," said Jimmy, shaking Mina's hand.<br/><br/>"How is Freddie? Have you seen him recently?"<br/><br/>"No."<br/><br/>"That's probably for the best. I always found our conversation a little tiresome. I'm afraid you find me in the autumn of an exile, Jimmy."<br/><br/>"Exile? You?"<br/><br/>"You remember my organization, the means I used to keep an eye on things?"<br/><br/>"Yes. For a long time I thought you might be behind this Epsilon Sigma we've encountered."<br/><br/>"You're not completely wrong. I was betrayed, and my group subverted from within. You remember Sheila? Apparently she never gave up on Muriel. She was always a woman of strong loyalty. I think it was of the kind that could only be turned once."<br/><br/>"Wait," said Ruby. "How long have you been doing this?"<br/><br/>"Since the 1890s," said Mina, smiling. "Sheila was a friend of Jimmy's and Freddie's. She was a lieutenant of mine, but she began to work against me--she never gave up on the search for Mirabelle, you know. I found out, but by then they had become too strong for me to oppose openly. I fled here, to one of the last friends I had left. I met Sir Godfrey...oh, almost forty years ago. While we were planning to go to Cairo. Where we were defeated. Anyway, Quincy didn't come back alive...they were very close, the poor man."<br/><br/>"What do they want Millicent...Mirabelle...for?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"We never did figure that out. Probably something to do with their old rituals, although that may not be possible, since James here managed to place a shield that should protect the Earth from outside influences. By the way, James, I must apologize for something and I'm glad I have the chance. When I saw you last, I didn't say what I should have. Well done, James. Very well done indeed."<br/><br/><br/><br/>Millicent had been taken aboard a very well-appointed, small steam liner. They gave her the best stateroom, right next to Vanessa's. Millicent of course wanted to see her immediately, but was warned the poor dear was resting.<br/><br/>They gave Millicent the most beautiful evening clothes, exact to her size in every measurement. That night she was led by eager, giggling young women to the ship's gorgeous ballroom. Vanessa, dressed in the most wonderful gown, rushed up to meet her.<br/><br/>"Vanessa!" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Please, dear. Mother. It's all right now, you can call me Mother!"<br/><br/>They embraced. "Are you all right, Mother?"<br/><br/>"I'm fine, dearest one."<br/><br/>Another woman walked into the ballroom. Somehow Millicent's eyes were drawn to her. And she had no doubt, none whatsoever, that if you took the picture she had of Uncle Jack and the little girl <i>whose face was not her own</i>, and let that girl grow up to be the same age as Millicent was now...that she would resemble in every particular the woman who strode toward them.<br/><br/>"Hello, sister," the other woman said, hugging Millicent with surprisingly strong arms. "<i>I'm going to take back what you stole!</i>" she hissed in Millicent's ear.<br/><br/>Millicent felt the room whirl around her and fell back, into the deep, all-embracing darkness, and knew no more for a long time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451864/#Comment_451864" name="Item_257" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-16T16:34:46+00:00" title="March 16, 2016  4:34PM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 17, 2016 2:55PM by Aviatrix.">edited March 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XIV: We Could Be Heroes...

"Hello, Dr. Orange, how was your flight?"<br/><br/>"Fantastic. Some trouble at customs."<br/><br/>"We had a couple of scrapes ourselves," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"So I've heard." He pointed at the headline of his newspaper. "They seem to think I'm a mass murderer of some kind."<br/><br/>Ruby fixed him with a stare over her sunglasses. "Really, doctor?" She sighed. "The local mafiosos want us dead."<br/><br/>"That's not much of a problem."<br/><br/>"The local authorities want us captured and dead. The man that we've been out trying to take care of discreetly knows that we're here. James had a talk with him yesterday."<br/><br/>"Oh, how did that go?"<br/><br/>"James was shot with a high-powered rifle. He's recovering. We found ourselves a little hole to hide in. And Geronimo may be knighted."<br/><br/>"Good for him. If anyone deserves it, it's definitely Geronimo. Are we invited? I'll have to wear my best clothes."<br/><br/>"Yes. Now, Montgomery Donovan is somewhere in Malta. We're going to track him down and deal with him discreetly. It's going to be a challenge, but we have some interesting allies."<br/><br/>"Allies? That's a change."<br/><br/>"They're a bit...irregular, but quite effective at what they do. Have you ever heard of St. George the dragon-slayer?"<br/><br/>"What?"<br/><br/>"He was a mighty knight who went out and slew the dragon and saved everyone. One of our allies is like that...except pretty much without metaphor."<br/><br/>"Do knights use guns now?"<br/><br/>"They use swords, shields, and guns. All effectively."<br/><br/>"And they want to help us? Why...Ruby, you didn't sleep with one of them!"<br/><br/>"Dr. Orange! They want to help us because we have the same goals. Well, we did pay the mercenaries. There's also mercenaries."<br/><br/>"So...people want to kill us, but they don't know where we are."<br/><br/>"For the moment. I'm sure a spy will locate us, and maybe toss a hotel room. Because that is how things are done."<br/><br/>"Tell me about it! At least they can't toss the last one--it's a crime scene. Lead the way, I'm ready for anything. I know you won't be taking me to your beach house."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Geronimo was preparing for his vigil. This involved some lectures with Sir Godfrey, which were uncomfortably weird, and some silent prayer, which gave him a little solace. Toward evening, the elderly knight told him what to expect during the actual vigil.<br/><br/>"You will be tested in the course of the night in three ways: you will be tested in your flesh, you will be tested in your faith, and you will be tested in your very soul."<br/><br/>"I feel my faith has already been tested," said Geronimo bitterly.<br/><br/>"Then this shall be the crucible and we will see if we anneal it, or if it will break." Sir Godfrey opened an old chest and took out a sword encased in a beautiful green leather scabbard. "It is not appropriate for you to use the Holy Sword until after your vigil. Take this weapon; it is the sword I prayed vigil over. It is a good weapon, and will serve you well."<br/><br/>He hung a pure white surcoat on the Spaniard's broad shoulders. On it was embroidered the simple red cross of the Templars. Sir Godfrey put on his own surcoat, with a more ornate cross and letters in an esoteric script running across the hem. He led Geronimo to the dilapidated chapel, choked with rubble and dust, where a sword incongruously gleamed on an ancient altar. They lit the candles in ancient sconces along the wall, and in the flickering light the mosaic floor, obscured by dirt and debris, could just be made out. On the walls, faded frescos looked down upon them, notably a huge archangel whose wings vanished into the gloom of the vaulted ceiling.<br/><br/>"You must not leave this chapel for the rest of the night," said Sir Godfrey. "No matter what happens, what you hear, what anyone does. If you do so, you will fail the test and not be worthy of bearing the great sword. Now. Do you feel ready to begin your vigil?"<br/><br/>"I'm ready," said Geronimo, bowing his head.<br/><br/>"Then we shall begin," said Sir Godfrey. He knelt, indicating for Geronimo to do so as well, and crossed himself. Standing up again stiffly, Sir Godfrey nodded, and then much quicker than his age would seem to allow, swept his sword out of its sheath.<br/><br/>"Defend yourself!" he cried, and fell upon Geronimo, hewing viciously at his head.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451865/#Comment_451865" name="Item_258" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-16T16:35:34+00:00" title="March 16, 2016  4:35PM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 17, 2016 2:56PM by Aviatrix.">edited March 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XIV: We Could Be Heroes... (Part 2)</b><br/><br/>Geronimo rolled away and drew his own sword. He knocked aside a blow and jumped to his feet. The old knight danced in, using feints to push Geronimo back until his back butted up against the ruins of an effigy tomb in the center of the church.<br/><br/><i>[3 points of damage. Sir Godfrey was good at this.]</i><br/><br/>Geronimo slid along the side of the tomb, narrowly avoiding another blow from Godfrey. He backed toward the wall and ducked beneath another vicious swing from the knight. The blade smashed into one of the wall sconces. The candle fell into a pile of rotted books, which burst into flame.<br/><br/>Geronimo sprang up and landed on top of a small altar beneath a statue of Mary. Sir Godfrey hewed at his feet, but Geronimo jumped over the blade and pounced, knocking the off-balance knight to the ground.<br/><br/><i>[Athletics test to jump out of  the way of the fire; GP got a 9, so Geronimo had the advantage of Sir Godfrey for  the Scuffling attack that brought them both to the ground.]</i><br/><br/>The old man rolled onto his side and smashed his armored elbow into Geronimo's face. Blood streamed down from his smashed nose. Geronimo smashed the pommel of his sword into Godfrey's face, bloodying his lip and opening a cut on his cheek. Godfrey rolled to his right this time, trying to break the pin and get free, but Geronimo yanked him around again. However, the elderly knight had managed to grasp his sword again in the scuffle, and he brought the flat of the blade square across Geronimo's back.<br/><br/><i>[They were trading blows here and I was rolling well--the knight did 7 points of damage total to Geronimo, putting him at 0.]</i><br/><br/><i>I need to start using my head</i>, thought Geronimo. He shoved Sir Godfrey down and then smashed the flat of his blade against the old man's chest.<br/><br/><i>[A Medicine spend refreshed 3 points of Weapons here.]</i><br/><br/>"<i>Pax</i>," said Sir Godfrey, casting away his blade. Geronimo helped him up to his feet. "You fought well," panted the knight. "I shall retire. The next two challenges you must meet on your own."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Ruby and Dr. Orange walked through Valletta by winding routes. Ruby waited until she was sure, and then said, "We have friends."<br/><br/>Dr. Orange's face brightened.<br/><br/>"Not <i>friends</i>," said Ruby. "We're being followed. <i>Our</i> friends are up ahead. Quick, turn this way!"<br/><br/><i>[Sense Trouble roll, then Preparedness to make good use of their mercs.]</i><br/><br/>They sprinted up an alleyway, only to discover that it was a dead end. Four men in cheap suits appeared at the mouth of the alley. One took out his stiletto, while the other lifted their clubs.<br/><br/>Suddenly they all heard the sound of whistling. The mafiosi turned around to see a man wearing a Stetson stroll into the alley behind them. He stopped, hands in his pockets, and spat out his hand-rolled cigarette.<br/><br/>"Well hell," he drawled. "There's only four of you. I thought this would be a fight."<br/><br/>The Corsicans snarled and charged at the American. One immediately went down, grabbed from behind by a Slavic-looking man wearing black clothes nobody had seen crouching in the shadows.<br/><br/>"That's Dallas," said Ruby, indicating the American. "And that was Boris over there." Dallas bashed in the face of one of the mafiosi with his Peacemaker revolver and then threw a kick into another of the Corsicans.<br/><br/>"Looks like they have things in hand," said Dr. Orange. Boris suddenly emerged from behind an ashcan and pulled down another Corsican.<br/><br/>"We need one alive!" shouted Ruby.<br/><br/>"Alive?" said Dallas. One of the two remaining Corsicans punched him in the face. "Alive is extra," snarled the American. He tripped the Corsican and knocked him to the ground. He spun his revolver around and pulled back the hammer. "Think about it," he grunted, drawing a bead on the mafioso's head.<br/><br/>Boris smashed the other Corsican's face into a wall and threw him on the ground. Dr. Orange tossed some coins at the groaning bodies lying on the ground. "Go find a doctor," he said, and jerked his head at Dallas. "Take that one with us."<br/><br/>They began dragging their semi-conscious prisoner toward the waterfront. "It is a tactical error to allow any of them to remain alive and able to talk," muttered Boris. "Unless you are sending a message, in which case you should have told us first. Sending a message isn't something you just throw together at the last minute."<br/><br/>"I didn't know there was going to be a <i>party</i>!" hissed Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"And you call yourself a German. Seriously, Beria has nothing on you people."<br/><br/>They found an abandoned storefront and pulled their victim inside it. "Where's the warehouse?" demanded Ruby.<br/><br/>"<i>Putain</i>, I'm not telling you anything," said the mafioso with a leer.<br/><br/>"You sure?" said Dr. Orange, gesturing at Dallas and Boris. Dallas was fingering the necklace of teeth he kept under his vest.<br/><br/>"You kill me, that's fine. If I talk, they'll kill me. Code of <i>omerta</i>."<br/><br/>"What if we take you out of here?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Go on," said the Corsican.<br/><br/>"Have you ever been to America?"<br/><br/>"No, but I have always wanted to go..."<br/><br/>"Los Angeles," said Ruby. "Movie stars. Beautiful girls. Sir, I am a purveyor of violence, I'm not going to lie to you about that. But it is not the only thing I'm good for. I also deal in favors. We need to do something. You clearly want a way out. I can get you a plane ticket. If you tell me about the warehouse."<br/><br/><i>[Me: That certainly sounds like a Bargain spend!]</i><br/><br/>"You don't want to go there," said the Corsican. "It is a bad place. But I will tell you where it is." He described the warehouse\u2019s location. It was far away from the normal shipping docks.<br/><br/>"We want to neutralize it," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"I wish you luck, fancy American whore. I would watch your step when you go there. They say the ground can swallow you up. I have never been there, thank God."<br/><br/>"What do you know about Donovan?"<br/><br/>"The boss? He's not been the same since his wife died. His son is in the hospital now...I never liked the kid, he creeped me out.

(Part 3)</b><br/><br/>Geronimo sat in the smoke-filled chapel, praying, his head bowed. He had put out the burning books but the room was still filled with choking vapors. He repeated his rosary over and over again, for a long time.<br/><br/>Suddenly he realized that someone was repeating his prayer.<br/><br/>He stopped, and then started a new rosary. "<i>Ave Maria, gratia plena...</i>"<br/><br/>"Well-fought, warrior of God," whispered someone.<br/><br/>Geronimo swallowed and continued to pray. The voice began to whisper the worst obscenities, ascribing deviant sexual practices to our Lord and Savior. Geronimo tried to continue to pray, but his hands were shaking with rage.<br/><br/><i>[A rare actual Stability test here to resist the effects of the whispering.]</i><br/><br/>"Pray louder," whispered the voice. "Like every good Catholic." It chuckled horribly.<br/><br/>From outside the chapel, Geronimo heard a new voice, a voice he could never forget: that of his brother Rodolfo. "Brother, help me!" the voice cried. "It's so dark, and they hurt me so badly, brother!"<br/><br/>"It's not real," said Geronimo. "I have mourned my brother. I have become a better man than I was. This is not Rodolfo!"<br/><br/>"You failed me, brother," said the voice. "You let me <i>die</i>! You could have stopped me that day! You're no leader! You should just give up now and stop. Leave this place and go away, before you kill everyone else too!"<br/><br/>"It's my fault that you died, yes!" groaned Geronimo. "But I will pay for it."<br/><br/>The voice switched back to the horrible whisper. "You could have him back, you know. This is in <i>my</i> power. Not the power of your silly God. Dead man impaled on a cross. Hasn't brought anyone back since Lazarus! I can bring Rodolfo back."<br/><br/>"No one is meant to come back," said Geronimo as calmly as he could.<br/><br/>"Interesting," whispered the voice.<br/><br/>In the corridor outside the chapel, Geronimo heard slow footsteps walking toward the door.<br/><br/>"All you have to do is open that door, warrior of God," said the voice. "I give this to you out of my enormous mercy."<br/><br/>"Indeed," muttered Geronimo. He drew his sword and crept toward a crucifix on the wall opposite the shrine to Mary. He was pretty sure the voice was coming from behind it.<br/><br/>"I don't want to move to the past," he said loudly, to cover his movements. "I want to move into the future."<br/><br/>"Ah, yes, your future with Ruby. You do know that you can never truly love her, consumed by guilt as you are. Your sad devotion to the pathetic rites of your church will never let you give yourself to her as she could give herself to you."<br/><br/>From behind the crucifix came a slow flow of sticky orange fluid that smelled faintly mossy. Nectar.<br/><br/> "But come. Drink. Be with her body and soul. Or you could choose to go own flagellating yourself because of what some dead carpenter told you to believe." The voice put a sneer of contempt into those last words.<br/><br/>From the door came a sharp rapping knock. Geronimo ignored it. The rapping became louder. He shut his eyes tight.<br/><br/>He heard the door begin to creak open. "The test is to endure! I will not strike at you!" he cried. He turned quickly and opened his eyes.<br/><br/>Rodolfo was standing in the doorway. His shirt was covered with blood from the gunshot wounds he had suffered at the hands of the Guardia Civil. His face had the pallor of death, and his eyes had the bruised look of a corpse.<br/><br/>"Brother," he rasped. "Help me!"<br/><br/>Geronimo slowly turned away and clutched his crucifix. "Lies," he muttered. "Lies, these are all lies! Liar, liar, liar!"<br/><br/>The door slammed shut. He heard a horrible gluttonous chuckle from behind the crucifix on the wall. All the candles in the room blew out and he was plunged into the darkness of the tomb.<br/><br/><i>[So those were some drivers against Geronimo's Statements--the last was a 4 point driver versus his Solace, and cost him a point of Sanity.]</i><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451886/#Comment_451886" name="Item_260" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-17T15:13:14+00:00" title="March 17, 2016  3:13PM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds awesome -- I'm sorry I missed it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451934/#Comment_451934" name="Item_261" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-21T15:03:18+00:00" title="March 21, 2016  3:03PM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XIV: We Could Be Heroes...

They entered the common room to find Mina bandaging Sir Godfrey's chest.<br/><br/>"What happened to him?" asked Ruby.<br/><br/>"Oh," said Mina, "Geronimo broke his arm."<br/><br/>"Ah, the vigil," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Fee buke ma naas," said Sir Godfrey thickly. His nose had swollen to the size of a ripe pear, and his beard was covered in blood. "Foos tuh Chemmun?"<br/><br/>"This is Dr. Orange," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Hi!" said Dr. Orange, extending his arm. Sir Godfrey sighed. "Blezant to meed yuh," he said. "I gudn't dell him during tuh fight, but he rully hurd me. Wuby, dere's bud on yuh dress."<br/><br/>"Ja, ja, was nothing," said Dr. Orange. "We just killed a few guys."<br/><br/>"This is why we don't let you do the talking," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"I mean, we ran into some old friends," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"Were they bad men?" said Mina.<br/><br/>"Oh yes."<br/><br/>"Good then."<br/><br/>"We talked to one of them," said Ruby. "He told us where the warehouse is."<br/><br/>"Oh, really," said Sir Godfrey, pulling some of the packing out of his nose. He pulled out a map of Valletta and let Ruby indicate the warehouse on it. "Good," said the elderly knight. "I know the route we should take. I can show you the first part of it."<br/><br/>He led them further into the caverns, sweeping up an electric torch to light their way. The walls were carved with ancient inscriptions, some in Latin, some in older and stranger languages. They passed shelves and depressions in the walls that were stacked with yellowed bones covered in dust.<br/><br/>"There are many catacombs under Valletta," said Sir Godfrey. "Many built by my order, some we just found."<br/><br/>Dr. Orange was less intrigued by the inscriptions and relics than the many ingenious traps that had been constructed in the passages. "Balance trap," he said, passing one room. "And there, an old crossbow trap!" Later, he exclaimed with pleasure, "A covered pit! With a pivoting lid! How delightfully medieval!"<br/><br/>"Let me disarm that," muttered Sir Godfrey. "Probably not functional, but still."<br/><br/>After a long walk through the twisty corridors, they stopped in front of an arched entrance to a broader way that sloped downward into the darkness. "Don't go any further before I disarm the trap," said the knight.<br/><br/>"Why, what's it do?" asked Dr. Orange eagerly.<br/><br/>"I have two twin-mounted Maxim guns in the next room," said Sir Godfrey. "The weight shift will cause them to fire. The interesting thing is that I can keep them depressed, and they will train up--almost as if tracking anyone fleeing them--due to the natural precession of the barrels from the recoil. Rather ingenuous, if I don't say so myself. Maintenance is terrible."<br/><br/>"How do you keep it running?"<br/><br/>"Well, I go through a fortune in gun oil..."<br/><br/>"Sirs, please," said Ruby, looking distinctly green in the face.<br/><br/>"Have you calculated the weight?" asked Dr. Orange. "I mean, the moment arm..." He began scribbling on a pad.<br/><br/>"I'm afraid I'm not a military engineer of this century," said Sir Godfrey. "I am well-versed in ancient techniques."<br/><br/>"See, look, if you correct the directional vector like thus..."<br/><br/>"Gentlemen," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Wait, I think he's on to something," said Godfrey. "I think I understand. A counterweight, yes?"<br/><br/>"Precisely," said Dr. Orange. "We need to calculate the weight allowance. I mean, if a small child wandered in here..."<br/><br/>"Yes, we don't want to kill children. But...what if they were working for them?"<br/><br/>"You need to give them a chance," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"The enemy has many guises...for example, people of shorter stature..."<br/><br/>"Now the trap's useless against little people! We should put in a secondary system, maybe some kind of garrote..."<br/><br/>"Let's go back and design this!" said Sir Godfrey.<br/><br/>"Gentlemen!" shouted Ruby. "Please, let's discuss this in more depth. We're not ready to destroy the Mouth yet."<br/><br/>"How do you plan to do that?" asked Sir Godfrey.<br/><br/>"Explosives. Many, many explosives."<br/><br/>"Do you have these explosives?"<br/><br/>"No, but we always seem to stumble across some," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"This is a military colony...dynamite and firearms are rather heavily restricted," said Sir Godfrey.<br/><br/>"Yes! To the military! We'll get the explosives from them."<br/><br/>"You're just going to ask the Royal Navy--"<br/><br/>"Ask is the wrong word," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"We'll borrow them!" said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>Sir Godfrey shook his head. "My dear doctor, I am bound by vows of poverty and chastity. I'm afraid if you take dynamite and blow it up, it's not borrowing. I believe at least one Commandment opposes this course."<br/><br/>"Two things. First, really all matter just transforms into different forms. They can collect it if they <i>really</i> wanted to. Second, the aims of the British military are the same as ours, they just don't know it, and it would be much too complicated to explain..."<br/><br/>"Are you a Rosicrucian? Because you talk a little bit like one."<br/><br/>"I'm a pragmatist."<br/><br/>"We had many alliances with the Rosicrucians. And the Masons, of course, although they got so much wrong...in any case, you could steal them from the Corsican mob. Of course, if they catch you, they'll cut your throat, rather than putting you in jail."<br/><br/>"Wait, the military here, how do they get along with the Corsicans?" asked Ruby.<br/><br/>"Poorly," said Sir Godfrey.<br/><br/>"And Montgomery Donovan?"<br/><br/>"I'd assume that relationship is more cordial; he's English, and rich."<br/><br/>"Maybe we could ask his son what we should do," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"He's in a highly fortified hospital!" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Look, we're going to get shot at no matter which of these three paths we take!"<br/><br/>"So let's take the path of least shooting!"<br/><br/><i>[Me: Come now.

Not going to work on you, is it?" she said, pacing in front of him.<br/><br/>"I've set my heart on this," Geronimo said.<br/><br/>"They teach you the Classics in Spain? One poem by monkeys I actually liked\u2026you know Akhilleus? Achilles, I think you call him. I liked that one. You know the bargain he was offered?"<br/><br/>"I can't remember."<br/><br/>"Achilles was a young bloke being hidden from his enemies. And he was told flat-out, you 'ave a choice. You can live a life full of glory, and die very young. Or you can live a life of perfectly normal happiness, but no one will remember your name. I always liked that story, because to me, it illustrates the true hypocrisy of all monkeys. Not a monkey who reads that story who doesn't say, 'Naff, I'd totally take the glory. Live that life, blaze 'cross the sky!' But there's not a monkey--and I have done experiments, so I'm speaking truth here--not a monkey who's lying there with his guts spilling out and all the shit and blood and dead people around him who if I showed up and said, oh, no one will know your name but you can live a nice normal life in some out of the way corner--they would take that in a second. Course, they can't, because they're dead. But they would have. Because you monkeys are total hypocrites."<br/><br/>She tapped out her cigarette on the altar bearing the gleaming, naked sword. "So I'm here to offer you the bargain of Achilles and see how much of a hypocrite you are," she said. "Here's your choice, Jerome. Go off now, I'll make sure you and Ruby are completely left alone, find yourself some nice place in California, climate just like Aragon. Maybe you'll herd some cattle, be a local vet. Just lovely. But. You won't be part of this anymore, and the world will end...or not; it won't be any of your concern. You won't have to carry that sword or anything. I've had that sword. It gets galling after a while. Or, finish the vigil; I'll just leave. And...well, you're going to die. Soon."<br/><br/>She lit up another cigarette and stood waiting.<br/><br/>After a long time, Geronimo spoke. "Well...as you say, I am a monkey. Why disappoint you?"<br/><br/>"I have to give you credit. I like that answer. You're all right, Geronimo. You don't mind if I show up when you do die in horrible agony--just to fill out a survey."<br/><br/>"Whatever gets you off," said Geronimo, annoyed.<br/><br/>"Fair enough. You'll probably want this." She swept up the scimitar and tossed it in the air. It spun end over end and Geronimo caught it.<br/><br/>As soon as it was in his hand, it changed, straightening out, growing a second edge, becoming longer and thinner until it was a veritable replica of Tizon, the sword of El Cid. Geronimo stared in wonder, and then looked up quickly. He was alone.

"We've evolved a plan to go to the hospital where they're keeping Monty's son."<br/><br/>"Really?" said Jimmy, pouring himself a cup of tea.<br/><br/>"Yes. I'm going to break my arm..." Ruby glanced around at the look of shock on her friends' faces. "My <i>prosthetic</i> arm. Does no one remember? Then we'll use that as an excuse to get into the hospital, I'll bring it in for repairs."<br/><br/>"Ah..."<br/><br/>"How did your conversation with him go? Did you find out any information?"<br/><br/>"No, not really. We had a drink on his balcony, then I got shot by a sniper."<br/><br/>"James, are you telling me you set all that up to go have a dick-measuring contest with the man who is trying to kill us? Did you at least <i>win</i>?"<br/><br/>"Well, I was conscious and he wasn't at the end. By the way," he said, handing Ruby a flat wooden box, "I thought you'd want this.

"The police have the body."<br/><br/><i>[Dr. Orange did some Psychological triage on Geronimo here, and JP wanted to know if the night's rest healed a point of Health (which would bring his badly wounded self...back to the campaign max of 12.</i><br/><br/><i>"Nut up, Jimmy," I said.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Jimmy planned out their disguises. "Ruby, you're going bottle blond. I should try to make Geronimo look...less handsome, I guess..."<br/><br/>"That is not possible," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Heavy sideburns then. Dr. Orange, I need to make you look French."<br/><br/>"<i>Pour quoi</i>?" said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"Best I can come up with.

They took Ruby into the admissions. She was cradling her broken prosthetic in her good arm. No one paid them much mind.<br/><br/>"I've got this," said Ruby. "Oh! It hurts!" she cried at the top of her lungs. "Someone bring me some juice! You there, get me some tea! I demand to see a nurse! I demand to see a doctor! I demand to see a carpenter!"<br/><br/>While she attracted a crowd of hospital staff desperate to get her to lower her volume below that of a DC-3 taking off, the rest of them ducked inside the hospital and made their way towards the Records Department.<br/><br/><i>[Stealth check by Jimmy, with the rest piggybacking.]</i><br/><br/>"Just look like you know what you're doing," said Geronimo, putting on his stethoscope and assuming an air of medical paternalism. Jimmy and Dr. Orange trailed after him through the gloomy hallways.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Ruby was eventually brought to a small examination room. A young Maltese woman in a nurse's uniform came in with her. "<i>Poverella</i>," she said, stroking Ruby's arm. "Such a tragedy. You are such a beautiful lady. Sit down. Please, let me get you something to drink, darling."<br/><br/>She seemed rather overly friendly.<br/><br/>"My associates are getting me a drink," said Ruby, smiling brightly.<br/><br/>"Of course. Ah, <i>il dottore</i>. Come in, sir, this beautiful young lady is in need of attention."<br/><br/>The doctor, a distinguished looking man in his forties, dressed in a white lab coat and moving with a firm, reassuring gait, sat down next to Ruby. "I must examine the site of the amputation to make sure that your prosthetic is well-fitted and not causing any irritation," he said, unpinning the sleeve on Ruby's dress. He took out a small vial from the pocket of his lab coat and poured it into a paper cup. "Here, drink this, it will help you relax," he said.<br/><br/>The cup was filled with a pale orange liquid with a very distinctive mossy odor. Ruby trembled with the effort of resisting the urge to gulp the Nectar down.<br/><br/><i>[I had switched resisting Nectar--a Stability test with a TN of 5 if the Nectar is in easy access--with making it a Driver, since the math works out the same. This does mean that it is possible to recover Stability from Nectar, but this seemed to model drug addiction better anyway. For a different drug, you might treat the addiction Drive as having been invalidated once toleration has been reached--in other words, it could still be driven, but it would be impossible to recover Stability from it.]</i><br/><br/>"No thanks," Ruby croaked.<br/><br/>"As you wish," said the doctor. He downed the Nectar and crushed the cup in his hand. "Now, darling," he said to Ruby, "why don't you take off those tawdry clothes so we may examine you more closely."<br/><br/><i>[RP: Bad touch!

"We've brought our solicitor, and we need to see the records on Montgomery Donovan Jr."<br/><br/>Jimmy tried to look like what he thought an English attorney would look like.<br/><br/>"Ay, just take them," muttered the woman, handing over some folders. Geronimo studied them. Young Monty was in room 304, in the Intensive Care Ward. In room 302 was another boy named Alexei, who had been admitted for bite wounds on his feet and legs a few weeks ago.<br/><br/>Oddly, only a Dr. Solazzio was allowed to care for both the boys.<br/><br/><i>[Bureaucracy spend by OP.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Ruby batted her eyes. "Oh yes," she purred. "Show me what you want to do, on her..."<br/><br/>The doctor and the nurse fell into the throes of passion, but slammed against the door, blocking Ruby's exit. She sighed, and pressed the call button next to the desk.<br/><br/><i>[Initially, Ruby made a Flattery spend to get out, but then we realized that she was at -1 Stability, so she'd need to pass a Stability test make a spend.

"Oh, my!" she said, nearly tripping over the writhing bodies on the floor. "I didn't know!"<br/><br/>She began to unbutton her uniform. Ruby tried to squeeze past her, but the nurse grabbed her good wrist: "<i>Pobrecita</i>, why are you leaving? Stay with us..."<br/><br/>Ruby sighed again and cold-cocked her with her artificial limb. The nurse fell back and was dragged into the embraces of the couple on the floor. Ruby pushed her way into the hallway, slammed the door behind her, and leaned against the door, panting.<br/><br/>She lurched away from the wall and stumbled into another examination room. She dug a can of nitrous oxide from one corner of the room and inhaled deeply from it to calm her nerves.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Jimmy, Geronimo, and Dr. Orange took the stairs up to the intensive care wing. A nurse was sitting at a reception desk in the vestibule, and two double doors behind her were guarded by a couple of men in dark suits who were not trying particularly hard to conceal their weapons.<br/><br/>"What are you doing here? This area is off limits," said the nurse in Italian.<br/><br/>"Only observing," said Geronimo, adopting the officious manner of a European physician.<br/><br/>"I will have to ask the doctor," said the nurse, getting up and going through the double doors. Jimmy eyed the two gorillas closely, trying to calculate his chances of taking them down quickly and quietly.<br/><br/>But after a brief wait the nurse returned with a man in a lab coat. His dark hair was slicked back with Vaseline or Vitalis, his nimble fingers seemed to squirm with a life of their own, and he had a slightly stopped posture and a faint smile that lacked all sincerity.<br/><br/>"<i>Signore, signore</i>, what can I do for you?" he purred.<br/><br/>"We literally want to walk down the hall," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"But this is the intensive care ward. It's only for certain special cases, off limits to everyone else."<br/><br/>Jimmy and Geronimo exchanged looks. "I'm from a hospital in Madrid," said Geronimo. "Our intensive care unit is not as advanced as yours. I wanted a chance to observe your practices."<br/><br/>"How regrettable that you did not call ahead..."<br/><br/>"I didn't call?" said Dr. Orange. "Oh, my mistake, I meant to call ahead."<br/><br/>"Well," mused Dr. Solazzio. "I suppose I should call Mr. Montgomery..."<br/><br/>"Just five minutes of your time," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"My time is very valuable, <i>signore</i>. Very...valuable."<br/><br/>"Clearly," said Dr. Orange. "A consultancy fee would be in order. I thought our hospital had arranged all that in advance."<br/><br/>Jimmy reached for his wallet.

He hasn't been the same since his mother died. He has some unknown disease that we are trying to treat with some experimental drugs."<br/><br/>"What kind?" asked Dr. Orange in what he hoped was a Viennese accent. "As a psychiatrist, I'm interested in such things."<br/><br/>"A psychotropic drug. The manufacture is somewhat obscure, I wouldn't want to bore you with the details."<br/><br/>"But what could he suffer from that would require psychotropics? This isn't a psychiatric ward, yes?"<br/><br/>"Surely you are a materialist. The mind is not separate from the body. We must treat both...young Master Donovan...I believe he had a psychotic break. Yes, that is very unusual, normally we wouldn't expect something like that until he was older."<br/><br/>"What about the other boy?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"He is a charity case we are doing."<br/><br/>Jimmy frowned. The doctor was clearly dissembling.<br/><br/><i>[Assess Honesty use.]</i><br/><br/>"That's so interesting," said Dr. Orange. "I didn't realize this hospital did charity--"<br/><br/>"Oh, Mr. Donovan is <i>extremely</i> generous," said Solazzio. "Now, may I offer you gentlemen some orange juice?"<br/><br/>Jimmy braced Solazzio against the wall with one arm. "Mr. Donovan sent six men to attack me and my friends. They all died. Mr. Donovan sent a sniper against me. And now Mr. Donovan is unconscious and lying in his house."<br/><br/>"I see. Allow me to rejoin with--" Solazzio turned to run. Jimmy pushed him down and the Italian skidded across the floor.<br/><br/>"You can scream for help," said Jimmy. "But be assured you will die before they get here."<br/><br/><i>[Intimidate spend by JP; the doctor scared easy.]</i><br/><br/>"I understand completely, <i>signore</i>."<br/><br/>"What is the deal with the kid next door?"<br/><br/>"He was bitten badly and admitted here. His metabolism is very similar to young Montgomery's, so we are treating him with a similar treatment as a control. Young Montgomery is manifesting certain...transformations. We have managed to arrest the progress of the disease thanks to this miraculous chemical. Would you like some?"<br/><br/>A highlight reel of Ruby's greatest addiction moments played in Jimmy's head. "Thanks, no."<br/><br/>"You know where this comes from?" said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"I don't know. I don't want to know. I think it's better for my health to not know."<br/><br/>"I see. Well, we should just kill him and get it over with."<br/><br/>"<i>What?</i>" shouted Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Why did you leave Germany?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Collateral damage is one thing," said Geronimo. "But not that."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Dr. Solazzio tried to hide in a corner and melt into a ball of slime. (Not literally; I know I have to be specific here.) Geronimo grabbed the charts for Alexei and Monty. The boys were being treated in parallel, as Solazzio said. He flipped to the intake notes for Monty; he had been brought in raving and in pain a few weeks ago. Sedation was the only way they could keep him quiet. Alexei had obviously been bitten by minor Mouths.<br/><br/>Oddly they had been doing transfusions of blood from Alexei to Monty.<br/><br/>"Stupid evil scientists," said Dr. Orange. Everyone gave him a look. "I mean, this is <i>sloppy</i>."<br/><br/>"We're taking them out of here," said Geronimo with finality. "Dr. Solazzio, prep them. We need a reason to take them out of this ward."<br/><br/>"You realize I have to sell this pretty hard..." muttered the Italian. He went to the medicine cabinet and prepped two syringes...<br/><br/>Moments later the doors to the Intensive Care Ward burst open and Geronimo and Dr. Solazzio emerged, trailed by the rest, pushing two stretchers. On them Alexei and Monty Jr. were in the throes of seizure.<br/><br/>"BP falling!" said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Damnit, I'm not going to lose you!" said Solazzio. They shoved past the bewildered guards and pushed the stretchers into the car of an elevator. Jimmy turned and held up one finger in warning at the guards as the doors to the elevator slammed shut.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452000/#Comment_452000" name="Item_266" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-29T16:01:45+00:00" title="March 29, 2016  4:01PM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XIV: We Could Be Heroes...

Suddenly she felt a comforting hand on her shoulder. <i>You can't beat this on your own</i>, Charlie whispered in her ear. <i>You have to find the others</i>.<br/><br/>Ruby closed her eyes and breathed deeply. She knew what she had to do. She had to find the others. She had to find the people who could help her.

She hurried up to them.<br/><br/>"Let me guess," she said to Jimmy. "No time to explain." She got into the ambulance.<br/><br/>An attendant came up, holding a sandwich. "Hey, what are you doing with my ambulance?" he said to Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"Leaving," said the German, and slammed the door closed.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Ruby insisted on driving one-handed, with Jimmy grabbing the wheel when she needed to shift. They drove towards the waterfront, hoping to send the two boys off to Nando's boat.<br/><br/>"Someone's following us," muttered Jimmy. Suddenly he pulled his gun and leaned out the window, firing at the tires of a car that was peeling away from the curb. A couple of shots struck home, exploding the front tire of the car, and the sedan fishtailed into the road. Ruby skidded around it and floored it.<br/><br/>"Why did you do that?" she shouted at Jimmy.<br/><br/>"They were going to box us in," said Jimmy. "Those other guys are definitely speeding up to catch us."<br/><br/>"I've got this," said Dr. Orange, grabbing a couple of oxygen bottles, Ruby's cigarette lighter, some chewing gum, and a cigarette. He bound the bottles together with electrician's tape and rigged a crude fuse with the other items.<br/><br/><i>[Explosives test by OP.]</i><br/><br/>Dr. Orange kicked open the back doors of the ambulance. He saw a black sedan rapidly closing the distance between it and the ambulance. He flung the bottles as hard as he could at the front of the car. The bottles smashed through the its windshield and exploded. The sedan spun out and crashed into the side of the road, already burning.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>They rerouted to Sir Godfrey's cave, wheeling the two raving children down into the underground consistory.<br/><br/>"Those are two creepy children," said Sir Godfrey. "Why are you bringing creepy corpse children here?"<br/><br/>"Leverage," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"One is leverage," said Jimmy. "The other is here through no fault of his own."<br/><br/>"An innocent," mused Sir Godfrey. "The first casualty of war, Mr. Wright."<br/><br/>Geronimo dragged all the supplies he could out of the ambulance and set about making the boys stable. Jimmy and Ruby repaired to Sir Godfrey's library to research Mount Kailash in Thibet.<br/><br/>"I've heard the name," said Jimmy. "No one has ever climbed it...well, except for a duel between a priest of the local religion and a Buddhist saint, who shot to the mountain in a flash."<br/><br/>"Not surprising," said Dr. Orange. "It's sacred to four religions: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and B\xf6n, the native Thibetan religion. Shiva is supposed to live there. Anyone who steps foot on it would be committing sacrilege."<br/><br/><i>[Occult by JP, Library Use by OP.]</i><br/><br/>"We'll need a guide," mused Ruby. "That could be a problem.

Did you ever say, 'No, Francis, let's not burn down this warehouse'?"<br/><br/>"At the time, I didn't realize he was going to burn down the warehouse until he brought out the bomb."<br/><br/>"James, there's such a thing as willful blindness."<br/><br/><i>[Quick Stability refresh by JP, who had changed Jimmy's "I'm still the man I used to be" Statement to "I remember the man I used to be."]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Poor moral Jimmy. So worried about the price he was paying, but so convinced it was what he had to do. But was it? I mean, come on James, when even Geronimo is beginning to doubt his own convictions, maybe it\u2019s time to examine your own life.<br/><br/>But Jimmy never did, did he? Dear, lucky Jimmy, always dodging the bill, always finding ways to make other people pay. I guess you have to admire it a bit: there\u2019s a certain grace and art to running the con so well that the mark always buys you dinner.<br/><br/>Oh, you say, he\u2019s so tortured though. Look at me, I\u2019m not the man I was! I\u2019ve become someone else! That\u2019s paying a price, right? <br/><br/>You haven\u2019t even <i>begun</i> to pay yet, Jimmy. And I\u2019m going to collect on what you owe. Count on it.<br/><br/>What, you think I\u2019m supposed to be some kind of a <i>neutral</i> narrator? Grow up, Francine. If you knew who I was, you\u2019d understand. \n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>On his way back from the church, Jimmy took the long way around to make a bit of a patrol before heading back to the consistory. He was sweeping through one of the outer rooms of Sir Godfrey's warren when he heard a pistol cock behind him. He put his hand on the hilt of the sword he had borrowed from the knight and froze.<br/><br/>"Hello, Mr. Wright," said a woman with an English accent. "I have to say, I'm going to enjoy this very much. I'm only supposed to arrest you, but I'm reasonably sure you're going to die while trying to escape. I have to say, Mr. Wright, what galls me is that you should betray someone who helped you so much. M is the finest woman I ever met, and you betrayed and killed her."<br/><br/>"What are you talking about? I just talked to her."<br/><br/>"Don't you lie to me about this!"<br/><br/>"I'm not lying, I just talked to her!"<br/><br/>He heard the snap of a baton unfolding, and his legs were struck from behind. He fell to the ground and rolled over. The Englishwoman, who was dressed as usual in black, came up and leveled her pistol at him. "I'm just going to do you right now," she said.<br/><br/>"Listen! We've faced off before! Have I ever <i>lied</i>? When we were in the office, we made our deal, and you walked out, remember?"<br/><br/><i>[Me: Wow, sounds like you're being awful Reassuring...make it a spend, given the situation.]</i><br/><br/>"But she's dead, they told me she was dead--"<br/><br/>"They betrayed her. They took over the whole operation. Sheila Brisbane! She got in over her head, and betrayed M."<br/><br/>"Prove it to me. You said you just talked to her."<br/><br/>"Do you want to speak to her?"<br/><br/>"More than anything in the world."<br/><br/>"Give me the gun--"<br/><br/>"No, I'll think I'll keep it.

(Part 11)</b><br/><br/>Dr. Orange, Geronimo, and Ruby were sharing a cold supper in the consistory when Jimmy entered, hands in the air, followed by the Englishwoman. "Nobody move," she said. "I'll kill Jimmy."<br/><br/>"We should shoot the hostage," muttered Dr. Orange. Geronimo gave him a look.<br/><br/>The Englishwoman looked around and saw Mina. She fell to her knees. Jimmy gently took her gun away as Mina approached and gently touched the woman's face.<br/><br/>"You've found the Sparrow," she said to Jimmy. "This is a good sign."<br/><br/>"Right," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"It's an excellent sign. She's one of our most capable agents. And she's going to help us now."<br/><br/>The Sparrow nodded wordlessly.<br/><br/>"Oh, she's on our side now?" said Ruby bitterly.<br/><br/>"She's on <i>my</i> side, and I'm on your side."<br/><br/>"Fantastic."<br/><br/>"Look, does this mean we get to kill someone now?" said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>The Sparrow stood up. "Oh, so this is Dr. Orange! I could still shoot him," she said as an aside to Mina.<br/><br/>Jimmy dragged the Sparrow to a chair. She sat down in a daze, looking around glassily until she saw Ruby. "Oh," she said. "I--"<br/><br/>"Dear, I have just one question for you. What did the five fingers say to the face?"<br/><br/>Then she smashed the Sparrow across the face with her prosthetic arm.<br/><br/>The Englishwoman rolled with the blow admirably. "Had that coming. I don't suppose a small squad of elite British soldiers might help?"<br/><br/>"Very much," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"And I guess we'll need to cancel those warrants. Who should we blame for the events at the hotel?"<br/><br/>"Corsican mob," said everyone but Ruby.<br/><br/>"Donovan," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"That could be a problem...but I will see what I can do."<br/><br/>"What happened to my seaplane?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Oh, the impound. I'll get it out of impound. And I guess you'll want me to remove the tracking beacon...my fault. Sorry. I'm very sorry I tried to kill you. I know it's inadequate and that Geronimo will probably try to kill me."<br/><br/>"No, he's the moral one."<br/><br/>"I could do it," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"You should go back and act as our inside person," said Jimmy to the Sparrow. "Keep us informed of what Epsilon Sigma is up to."<br/><br/>"Yes, I could do that," she said. "They've already taken Millicent, you know."<br/><br/>"What?" shouted Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Where?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"I'm not sure," said the Sparrow. "I had assumed England, but the last I heard they were headed for the Suez Canal."<br/><br/>"I'd ask you to get your friends out of my business," said Jimmy. "But you already wrecked it."<br/><br/>"I suppose we could talk to the FBI..."<br/><br/>"Don't bother. Edgar and I are on speaking terms."<br/><br/>"I could make things a bit easier for you with the British Empire, if you'd like."<br/><br/>"Do that. I understand now--just a little bit--what Freddie went through."<br/><br/>"Freddie <i>Blakely</i>? Oh my. We used to take that file out and read it on winter nights when we needed to keep ourselves amused. Do you know how thick it is? The London Social Directory is thinner!"\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Ruby found Jimmy reading alone in the library. He instinctively slammed the book he was reading shut as she came in.<br/><br/>"James," she said, "we've been doing this for how long?"<br/><br/>"Seven months, give or take."<br/><br/>"Why don't you just let us start reading those books together. You know you can trust us at least. You don't have to talk so cryptically about them. It's annoying enough when our enemies do that!"<br/><br/>"It's not you I don't trust, it's the books. Once you step foot in that world, you can't leave it--"<br/><br/>"You don't say," said Ruby, waving her prosthetic.<br/><br/>"And I have been trying to minimize that as much as possible."<br/><br/>"James, I am as much in the shit as you are."<br/><br/>"But you haven't seen it all!"<br/><br/>"Have you?"<br/><br/>"I've seen plenty. I've seen enough. Anyway, we need the spell Godfrey told us about...then maybe we can do research."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Dr. Orange set up a laboratory to make some plastique, dragooning everyone to help him. "This is the part that is dangerous," he told people. "So be careful, unless you all want to look like Ruby."<br/><br/><i>[Chemistry spend by OP.]</i><br/><br/>Geronimo had Nando evacuate the two boys to his ship. "We still need to find a place for them," he said.<br/><br/>"M and her people are probably our best answer," said Jimmy. "She's used to dealing with stuff like that."<br/><br/>"LSAS can pay the bill," said Ruby. "Maybe we should send them to Los Angeles. In fact...she needs a new organization..."<br/><br/>"Los Angeles?" said Mina when they broached the idea to her. "But it's so...<i>gauche</i>.

(Part 12)</b><br/><br/>Ruby evolved a plan. She and her companions would sneak into the warehouse to find the Mouth. Once they were inside, the Sparrow's British team would assault the warehouse to keep the guards off of them. Once the Mouth was taken care of, they would speed over to Donovan's townhouse and assault that with their mercenary team.<br/><br/>The Sparrow and Mina would work their contacts to find trustworthy doctors to take care of the two boys...but it would take them some time, so Nando kept them for now.<br/><br/>Before they left, Jimmy dyed Ruby's hair red again, to bring her spirits up, and boxed a few rounds with Geronimo to do the same for him. Dr. Orange engaged him in a rather dense philosophical conversation about Nietzsche while they were packing the explosives, but it kept his mind off of the things that awaited them.<br/><br/><i>[Various Stability refreshing psychological triage bits.]</i><br/><br/>Sir Godfrey took them to the edge of the catacombs under Valletta. He gave them four glass vials full of a clear liquid. "These were blessed by a priest who sadly is no longer with us. They are transformed Nectar...they should give you some resistance the call of that substance. Do what you need to do with them."<br/><br/>The passage through the catacombs was long, dusty, and fatiguing. Dr. Orange meticulously disabled the traps they encountered on their way, and Ruby used her archaeological experience to help them keep their heads. At one point, quite improbably, they had to cross a large cavern spanned by a collapsed bridge, but Geronimo was able to rig up a rope bridge to get them across. Far below them, an underground river flowed, black in the dim light.<br/><br/><i>[The actual text has a whole bunch of challenges here that you can use skills to overcome but ultimately I wanted to get to the confrontation with the Mouth (and I found them a bit underwhelming, to be honest.) So I required three points of spends to navigate the catacombs, and colored it based on which skill they used.]</i><br/><br/>They finally came up against a cinderblock wall. Jimmy used a pick to break through it, and they found themselves in an anonymous looking industrial corridor--tiled floors, walls painted a sickly green, naked light bulbs in cages providing the illumination. They could hear people walking in the warehouse above them. A sign in Italian indicated that the office was to their right.<br/><br/>And everywhere was the heavy, delicious, mossy scent of Nectar.<br/><br/>Jimmy led them down the corridor as stealthily as possible. Geronimo helped by simply picking up Ruby; even struggling, she was quieter that way.<br/><br/>As they approached the office, they heard the sound of a woman crying. Geronimo and Jimmy took a peek around the edge of the doorway. They saw Bethany Mae Hampton sitting behind a steel desk, weeping. A pistol lay on the blotter in front of her. She reached out and picked up the gun, then turned it to face herself--<br/><br/>Jimmy strode into the room and put his hand over hers, forcing the gun down. Bethany bolted back. "Don't kill me," she said somewhat incongruously.<br/><br/>"I'm trying to stop you from doing it yourself," said Jimmy. "Don't ask me why."<br/><br/>"Right...oh God...what are y'all doing here?"<br/><br/>"Destroying the Mouth."<br/><br/>"You may want to get out," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"That's probably for the best," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Jimmy...please understand, I never tried to hurt any of y'all...I just had to keep an eye on you and run you off. That time in Mexico, we were trying to keep Brooks from being all, you know, <i>insane</i> and all?"<br/><br/>"Sure. And I've totally forgotten about the Shao Lin monks you sent after me."<br/><br/>"They were just there to frighten you. I didn't think your girl would have a shotgun."<br/><br/>"Seems I'm getting a lot of apologies today."<br/><br/>"Just...when we got the girl, they said I could take over here, and eventually they'd get rid of Monty because he's a liability. But I didn't know, Jimmy, I didn't know what it was really like. We were looking for the girl, because she was the savior of humanity...but...it talks to me, Jimmy. It <i>talks</i>..."<br/><br/>"Where is it?"<br/><br/>"Down further that way. I'm...I'm sorry."<br/><br/>"Sorry isn't going to fix anything. But it's a start."<br/><br/>"I achieved what I set out to do, and frankly I don't care about all this stuff. Can...I help you? I don't know anything about redemption, Jimmy, I suppose that's more Geronimo's line. I don't remember who I used to be anymore. I'm not even from Georgia."<br/><br/>"If you get to England, look up Dr. Seward. He's a friend of mine. He can help." <br/><br/>"I still want to help. Should I get all the workers out of here?"<br/><br/>"Yes," said Ruby. "We don't want to hurt anyone. Say it's a fire drill."<br/><br/>"I'll do that. I really didn't know." She paused on her way out of the office. "Jimmy? Everyone?

(Part 13)</b><br/><br/>As they continued down the hallway, they heard the sound of fire alarms ringing. The smell of Nectar rolled over them as they came to the end of the corridor, which dead ended in a large squarish room.<br/><br/>"I'm going to wait outside," said Ruby meekly. "If I go in there, bad things are going to happen."<br/><br/>The rest of them burst into the room, guns drawn, ready to throw their packs into the gaping maw on the ground in front of them...<br/><br/>Except there was nothing there. The floor was smooth poured concrete. They glanced at each other in confusion. Slowly, Jimmy raised his eyes to the ceiling.<br/><br/>The enormous Mouth hung above them. As he stared in shock, It opened wide and a long, sticky, thin tongue snaked down like an elephant's trunk and wrapped itself around his neck. Jimmy was hoisted in the air, struggling fiercely, and managed to pry the disgusting member off of his neck. He fell to the ground with a thud, Nectar spurting all around him. Above, the Mouth closed Its ragged, lipless edges...and vanished.<br/><br/>Jimmy pulled out the vial Sir Godfrey had given him and drank it down before the smell of the Nectar that was soaked into his clothes could overcome his senses. Across the room, Dr. Orange saw a tiny movement in the corner of his eye and ducked instinctively. The Mouth suddenly opened wide on one of the side wall. A plume of Nectar shot over his head, and the tongue lashed out and grabbed his ankle. He fired some wild shots at the Mouth as It dragged him into Its maw and bit down hard.<br/><br/>As the doctor shrieked, the Mouth began to move along the wall, dragging him with it. Geronimo drew his sword and stabbed the Mouth. It spat Dr. Orange out, drenching Geronimo in Nectar...and vanished.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Ruby, shivering in the hallway, heard the confused sounds from inside the room--Jimmy's surprised shout, rapid pistol fire, someone chanting in Latin--and came to a sudden decision. She drank from the vial that Sir Godfrey had given her, terrified that it would trigger a Nectar flashback...<br/><br/>Instead, a moment of crystalline clarity came over her, as fast as the feeling of arousal that Nectar produced in her would have set in. She felt the heightened awareness the drug gave her, but none of the loss of control.<br/><br/><i>[I told Ruby to refresh a point of Sense Trouble.]</i><br/><br/>Ruby ducked into the room, letting her suddenly sharp senses guide her intuition. Without even knowing why, her attention was drawn to a part of the wall behind Geronimo. She looped her backpack full of Semtex over her artificial arm and pushed past the Spaniard. Suddenly, the Mouth yawned open directly in front of her.<br/><br/><i>[Sense Trouble and Preparedness to find where the Mouth was going to be.]</i><br/><br/>She shoved her prosthetic into the maw and felt the shudder of the arm crunching beneath Its teeth. She rolled away hard, feeling the wrench in her shoulder as she pulled free of the arm's harness, and flipped up the detonator on the satchel charge.<br/><br/>Jimmy saw what she was doing and dove across the room at Ruby, shoving her back as she fired the charge. She felt a tremendous pressure flatten both of them into the floor, followed a horrible sensation of heat lancing into her side as the explosion rolled over them. She almost didn't hear the detonation that left her ears ringing and muffled all the noise in the room. She tried to stand up, but passed out before she could push herself off the floor.<br/><br/><i>[Eight points of damage from the bite, then another 5 from the explosion; Jimmy knocked her out of point blank range with an Athletics check.]</i><br/><br/>Shattered teeth and vile caustic saliva rained down on all of them. The Mouth vanished. Then, despite their deafness, they heard a horrible chuckle ripple through the room. The Mouth...was laughing.<br/><br/>Suddenly it reappeared, gaping directly beneath Jimmy's feet. He leapt back as the tongue lashed out and slapped him. Geronimo slashed out with the sword, severing the tip of the tongue. Faster than he could see, the truncated tongue lashed itself around his ankle, pulling him to the ground and beginning to drag him towards the open maw.<br/><br/><i>[Athletics check by JP.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy drew the sword he had borrowed from Sir Godfrey and stabbed the ancient blade down at the Mouth. The steel grated horribly against the serrated teeth, and black blood began to flow from the cuts he made. The tongue released Geronimo and the Mouth closed again, vanishing.<br/><br/>Geronimo rushed to Ruby and began treating her wounds. He tossed Dr. Orange a bottle of benzedrine to give him a pickup as he came over to help with Ruby. Jimmy saw them gather together and felt his stomach drop into his ankles. "No, don't bunch up like that--"<br/><br/><i>[First Aid stuff here; probably I failed to enforce the "Health can't be healed higher than what you started the scene with" rule here, but OTOH I put them immediately in trouble...]</i><br/><br/>The Mouth reappeared almost directly beneath them. Geronimo nimbly rolled out of the way, but Ruby and Dr. Orange slid down into the awful throat. Dr. Orange seized one of the jagged teeth to catch himself with one hand, and grabbed Ruby's collar with the other.<br/><br/>Geronimo rushed up and caught Ruby's hand in his. Dr. Orange helped him pull Ruby free as the Mouth closed around his waist. The Mouth began to move again, sliding towards the wall and then <i>up</i> it, gliding over to the ceiling with the now-inverted torso of Dr. Orange flailing his arms helplessly at the floor.<br/><br/><i>[JP was out of Athletics and asked if Jimmy could spend Health instead to catch the doc when the Mouth released him; I agreed...at 3-for-1.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy slid across the floor and caught Dr. Orange mostly by cushioning his fall. Before he could get back up again, the Mouth's tongue wrapped around his torso, hoisted him into the air, and bit down, the sharp teeth ripping into his body. Geronimo charged back under the Mouth and stabbed up with the Sword. Blood and ichor rained down on them, and the Mouth began to calcify, turning into a twisted stone sculpture. Jimmy fell as the tongue crumbled into dust, but Geronimo caught him and managed to gently lower him to the ground.<br/><br/>"We need to get this place on fire without it spreading," said Jimmy. <br/><br/>"On it," said Dr. Orange. He used the rest of their explosives to set up a controlled demolition that if it wouldn't quite destroy the entire building, would certain render it useless. Outside they found that most of the minor Mouths that littered the ground were calcifying; the ones that weren't, they poured gasoline on and set on fire.<br/><br/>They stole one of the cars parked nearby and drove away.

(Part 14)</b><br/><br/>They drove into Valletta. To the house of Montgomery Donovan.<br/><br/><i>[The PCs were pretty messed up right now; Jimmy and Dr. Orange were both at negative Health. Sadly, they were out of First Aid.]</i><br/><br/>They arrived at the square in front of his townhouse. Yvonne, their sniper, had already taken a position on top of a roof across the street. Boris, Dallas, and Umberto were sitting at a cafe drinking coffee.<br/><br/>"They have about six guys we have to worry about, plus staff," Boris told them. "It's bad, fighting floor to floor like this. We have been studying it in Soviet War College. Might come in handy...someday." He gave Dr. Orange a quick glance.<br/><br/>The square began to empty of people as they took up positions. Shutters banged shut on the houses surrounding the open space. From somewhere, the sound of Spanish guitar music could be heard.<br/><br/>"I could go inside, find out lay of land, maybe kill somebody," said Boris.<br/><br/>"Please do," said Ruby. "But if you find somebody, maid, butler, who doesn't shoot at you, just knock them out."<br/><br/>"I make no guarantees." He loped into the shadows and vanished. They waited a long while. Ruby thought she saw a window on the side of Donovan's townhouse open and close quickly, and a person slip inside.<br/><br/>Suddenly there was a horrible, unearthly scream, something that could not possibly be human. The screams continued over the sound of gunshots. Suddenly Boris and another man came crashing out through third floor window. They tumbled through the air in a cloud of glass shards and smashed into the cobblestones with a crunch.<br/><br/>"Mouths," said Jimmy with distaste. "They must be using them as some kind of magical alarm system. They'll know if we get inside."<br/><br/><i>[Cthulhu Mythos spend by JP, 2 points of Stability loss.]</i><br/><br/>"No use going in soft then," said Dallas.<br/><br/>"We'll throw some explosives in one window and go in the other," said Jimmy. "Capitalize on the confusion."<br/><br/>"I like your thinking, Mr. Jimmy!"<br/><br/>"Yes, Mr. Jimmy's a smart fellow," said Ruby resignedly.<br/><br/>"We did something like that in Oklahoma once. Them bootleggers never saw us coming. We drank well that night!" \n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Geronimo darted across the square and threw the pipe bomb through one of the front windows of the townhouse. It exploded almost immediately, showering him with shards of glass and debris. Based on the screams, he guessed one of the guards had been taken out by the bomb.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Ruby, Dr. Orange, and Jimmy used the confusion to force one of the side doors of the townhouse, next to its garage. They jumped through it and landed in a well-appointed parlor. Cowering in one corner, under a B\xf6sendorfer grand piano, was a young woman in a maid's uniform.<br/><br/>"Ne me tuez pas," she whispered.<br/><br/>"Just stay down," Jimmy said. "We're not going to kill you."<br/><br/>She nodded, eyes large. "Deuxi\xe8me \xe9tage," she said.<br/><br/>"Third floor," said Dr. Orange, mentally converting to the American method of counting stories.<br/><br/>Jimmy cracked the door of the room. He heard someone come down the stairs and flattened himself against the wall. As soon as he heard the man hit the carpet runner in the front hall, he opened the door again.<br/><br/>"Hey," he said. The other man, one of Donovan's ubiquitous black-suited minions, spun around. Jimmy put a bullet in the center of his forehead. As the others emerged from the parlor, he picked up the dead man's sawed-off shotgun.<br/><br/>Geronimo kicked in the front door and joined them. Jimmy nodded. "There's a guy upstairs covering the landing. Heard him move around."<br/><br/>"I have a pipe bomb," said Dr. Orange. "If one of you wouldn't mind risking getting shot..."<br/><br/>"I understand, Kaiser Wilhelm," said Ruby. "And I accept your mission!"<br/><br/>"I'll do it," said Geronimo, gently pushing Ruby to the back of their group. "She's a little out of her head."<br/><br/>Jimmy and Geronimo charged up the stairs. They saw a man standing on the landing, holding a Thompson. Jimmy fired off both barrels of his shotgun to distract the man, and Geronimo flipped the pipe bomb at him.<br/><br/>It went off with a loud report. Down on the ground floor, the lamps swung back and forth and plaster dust rained down on them.<br/><br/>They made their way up the stairs in a rush. Suddenly Jimmy stopped dead. "There's a garrote strung across the doorway," he hissed. "Clearly they wanted to distract people and then try and shoot them--"<br/><br/>A shot rang out and caught Jimmy in the shoulder. He crumpled to the ground. As Dr. Orange crawled over to treat him, Geronimo slid to the side, drew his sword, and cut the wire with it. "The man with a gun is in the bathroom across the hall," he said. <br/><br/>Ruby lit a pipe bomb. "It's the Fourth of July, everyone!" she said, and chucked it across the hall.<br/><br/>The sound of the explosion was quite literally deafening. Through the cloud of dust and the ringing of their ears, they saw a man stagger out of the bathroom, bleeding from his arm. Geronimo shot him.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452046/#Comment_452046" name="Item_275" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-05T21:25:10+00:00" title="April  5, 2016  9:25PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Blink.

(Part 15)</b><br/><br/>They crowded into the only room other than the bathroom on that floor. It seemed to be some kind of a sitting room, a windowless box with a few armchairs and an expensive wooden bookcase. There was a double door set in the wall opposite the entrance to the sitting room. Geronimo rapped on it, and it rang hollowly.<br/><br/>"Steel door," he said.<br/><br/>"This had better be the last time I do this today," said Dr. Orange grumpily. He set up some explosive charges and they retreated to the landing. <br/><br/>He had done his work well--the charges went off with a muted <i>bang</i>, and then they heard the grating of metal as the heavy door swung inward, shearing through its hinges and dropping with a clatter to the floor.<br/><br/>Jimmy strode through the smoke cloud into a large bedroom, dominated by a huge canopy bed. The windows were shuttered, and the light that filtered through the slits in them cast bar-like shadows on the smoke and dust hanging in the air. Medical equipment was scattered around the room, including an IV stand next to the bed. A line snaked down from it into the arm of Montgomery Donovan, who was lying flat on his back on the bed.<br/><br/>"Mr. Wright," he gasped. He raised one arm off of the bed. In his hand he was clutching a sawed-off shotgun. Jimmy leveled his pistol at him.<br/><br/>"I was hoping you'd be the one to do it," sighed Donovan. "It's a terrible thing to be a man like me, when you give up. You just don't have it in you to do it yourself..."<br/><br/>"I can't kill you if you kill me first," said Jimmy simply.<br/><br/>"Why don't you put your gun down first?"<br/><br/>Jimmy shrugged and lowered his pistol. "I don't need a gun to kill you," he said. Donovan let his arm fall back on the bed. <br/><br/>"Where's the spell?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"It's on the bookcase over there," said Donovan. "Monty's library is upstairs, if you care to peruse any of his volumes."<br/><br/>"<i>Mensch, was gibt's</i>?" said Dr. Orange. "How did you end up like this?"<br/><br/>"There was a lot of money to be made. And I thought I was a man without sentimentality. Until my wife died. And then I realized I was not...I won't say <i>strong enough</i>...more that I was not the man I thought I was."<br/><br/>"Yeah, that will happen," said Dr. Orange. Jimmy twitched.<br/><br/>"My son was not the person I thought he was as well," continued Donovan. "It is a terrible thing to discover your son is a matricide."<br/><br/><i>[Me: I mean, the kid is like 14, so he's basically spent his entire life near a Major Mouth.</i><br/><i>RP: That kid is like the next anti-Jesus.</i><br/><i>Me (singing </i>Omen<i>-style): Chorus! Evilus! Bogus! Latinus!]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy walked next to Donovan and bent down close to his ear. "We're not all the men we thought we were," he whispered. "But I never gave up."<br/><br/>"You make me wish that what I was about to tell you wasn't true," replied Donovan in a sepulchral whisper. "I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. But mercenaries <i>don't always stay bought</i>."<br/><br/>Jimmy twitched again, then dragged a pillow across Donovan's head, shoved his pistol into it, and pulled the trigger twice. He turned around, blinked, and then said in an odd tone of voice, "I need to get to the plane. I can fly it."<br/><br/>"Why does he sound like Ruby?" muttered Dr. Orange.

While Geronimo cast off, Jimmy and Ruby made their way to the cockpit and rapidly ran the pre-flight checklist.<br/><br/>"Jimmy, you have to keep the manifold..." began Ruby.<br/><br/>"...pressure under 300. I know! I need..."<br/><br/>"Flaps! 10 degrees!"<br/><br/>"Right...."<br/><br/>In that manner they made their lurching way across the bay and staggered into the air. Jimmy turned the plane in broad circles until they sighted Nando's yacht. He dove the plane at it, leveled off at the last possible moment, and then slammed the flying boat into the waves roughly. Chop tossed the plane back and forth as they came under the lee of the ship.<br/><br/>Jimmy unbuckled his seat, limped back to the hatch on the wing, and lurched across it until he could jump onto the yacht, followed by the rest.<br/><br/>"There's three mercs on the boat," he said. "Smythe, Xavier, and Nando. But which one?"<br/><br/>"You know what I say," said Dr. Orange. "Kill them all and let god sort them out."<br/><br/>Nando came up on deck. "Geronimo, you always make the most impressive entrances...holy shit!" He gaped at them. They were still covered in blood, slime, and dust.<br/><br/>Jimmy jabbed his pistol at Nando. "Santiago," said Nando. "You look very <i>determined</i>."<br/><br/>"No shit, Einstein," said Jimmy. He glared into the Spaniard's eyes.<br/><br/>Ruby put her hand on Jimmy's shoulder. "It's not him," she whispered. "He's perplexed, not deceptive."<br/><br/>"Gracias, beautiful se\xf1orita," said Nando.<br/><br/>"Not now, playboy."<br/><br/>Jimmy pushed past them and thumped down below deck. Smythe came running up the companionway to meet him. "Thank God you're here," he said in his reedy English accent. "They're....<i>what on earth happened to you people</i>?"<br/><br/>Jimmy shoved him up against the wall and held him there for a long moment. "Not him," he said to the others. <br/><br/><i>[Assess Honesty spends by RP and JP.]</i><br/><br/>"Then Xavier," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"The demolitions expert..." said Geronimo.<br/><br/><i>He's going to blow up the ship</i>, they all thought simultaneously.<br/><br/>"I sent him back to watch the boys," said Smythe. "I moved Janet and Betty up to the front of the ship. What's wrong?"<br/><br/>"He's been bought off," barked Jimmy, pushing past him.<br/><br/>"What?" exclaimed Smythe. "Damnit, Xavier. Damn your Irish hide!"<br/><br/>Jimmy rushed back to the wardroom Smythe had turned into a sickbay, kicked open the hatch, and then ducked inside the room. He saw Xavier cowering in one corner. On one of the bunks, Alexei, who had come out of his induced coma, was screaming wildly and straining at his restraints. Both he and the Irishman were staring at Monty Junior. The boy had somehow freed himself and was standing in the middle of the room, body wracked with a grand mal seizure. His head lolled back and forth sickeningly. His arms moved blindly towards Alexei, grasping at his throat.<br/><br/><i>[JP made a Sense Trouble roll, so this only cost 2 points of Stability.]</i><br/><br/>Without even thinking, Jimmy raised his gun. Geronimo grabbed his arm. "He's just a child," he said.<br/><br/><i>[Soft Driver against Jimmy's "I want to be the man I used to be" Value!]</i><br/><br/>"Once you're corrupted you're gone!" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>As Ruby stared at Monty, she noticed his neck was growing longer...thinner...like it was straining to the breaking point...<br/><br/>And then it snapped. Monty's head fell to the floor with a thudding sound. Slits appeared on his hands, gaping horribly, lined with teeth...<br/><br/>Geronimo's sword swept out as if of its own volition and he hacked down at Monty's body. Ruby drew her pistol at the same time and began pumping rounds into the ex-human. Jimmy grimaced and emptied his automatic pistol at Monty as well.<br/><br/>Dr. Orange shrieked and fired his own pistol into the shaking body of Monty, which collapsed and shook, leaking ichor. The German kept firing anyway until the pistol clicked on an empty chamber.<br/><br/>Jimmy popped a new magazine into his pistol and swiveled to face Xavier. The Irishman gulped, still shaking from what he had seen, and simply said: "He offered me a lot of money."<br/><br/>Jimmy thumbed the hammer back on his pistol.<br/><br/>"He hasn't done anything to betray us yet," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Did you put any explosives on this boat?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Maybe a few," said Xavier.<br/><br/>"I'll go with you to disarm them," said Dr. Orange.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>They brought the ship back to harbor, where they were met by the Sparrow and a contingent of the Shore Patrol. She put them up for the night at the best hotel in Malta...with round the clock "protection" from the Secret Service.<br/><br/>Somehow a letter got through to them anyway, from Bethany Anne. It simply said, "Millicent is in Thibet."<br/><br/>It was Ruby who put the pieces together. "Wait, isn't there some kind of legend about Thibet?" she said to Jimmy. "Something about a mysterious alien being in Thibet? The Mi-Go?"<br/><br/>Jimmy shuddered. "Right. Yeah, they're hardly abominable snowmen. I tangled with them once. They're supposed to be able to put your brain into a cannister and take it with them into space..."<br/><br/>He stopped. "Brains..."<br/><br/>"Surgery!" said Ruby. "They must be perfect surgeons! Can they...can they put the brains back?"<br/><br/>"They're supposed to."<br/><br/>"And that means...that thing we saw, that memory of Millicent's in the Yucatan..."<br/><br/>"That must have been Katakatak's plan," said Jimmy. "They put her brain in another body. So if they're heading to the Mi-Go..."<br/><br/>"They're going to put it back," said Ruby.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452135/#Comment_452135" name="Item_280" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-11T15:58:23+00:00" title="April 11, 2016  3:58PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 12, 2016 2:24PM by Aviatrix.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So at last we head off into the two part finale, which was up and down, but mostly up (at least if you ask my players, I think). I'm not completely satisfied with how the last episode played out for <i>either</i> my <i>Masks</i> game or my <i>Eternal Lies</i> game, which is something I should probably write about when we get to the end of this mad project.<br/><br/>I did much more prep than usual for these two sessions; and as it turns out, I think that was a little problematic, as the prep got in the way of my dramatic instincts and made me concentrate too much on the minutiae of some problems.<br/><br/>You can see this a bit in my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw8iFfIRXgBOMXlBLUloT1NkX28/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Climbing Mount Kailash</a> handout. There are, I think, a bunch of good ideas contained in it, but also a lot of stuff that is simply too complicated. The Altitude Sickness rules, for example, needed to be pared down another couple of times, and why I thought bringing over the Journey rules from Dungeon World--when I have consistently been unable to make those moves interesting in play--was a good idea, I don't know.<br/><br/>You can also see me reaching to try and find a way to bring the three-valued World style resolution into Gumshoe. I'll be frank; it didn't really work. I still think there's some value to exploring ways to bring moves into Gumshoe without violating the "competence porn" nature of the game, but I'm not clever enough of a designer to figure out how to do it.<br/><br/>There was another set of things I did in this episode which I'm actually pretty proud of and <i>did</i> work pretty well, and I'll touch on that when we get there. Also, I like my version of the final confrontation better and it certainly was a better fit for this group; when Lisa ran EL for me, I did find that part a bit underwhelming, through no fault of her own--I'm not a huge fan of how it is written in the actual text, and Gumshoe contests are really not an awesome mechanic, at least not the way the are laid out in the text. (One of my quests is to find a replacement for them.)<br/><br/>The title of this episode is the first time I've been able to work in a reference to Leonard Cohen's fascinating, maimed <i>Death of a Ladies' Man</i>, an ill-fated attempt to bring together the genius of Cohen and Phil Spector that resulted in Spector seizing control of the masters (literally at gunpoint, according to Cohen.) Cohen's basically disowned the album, but it remains for me a fascinating "what-if" given the way the excellence of several of the songs tries to shine through the carwreck of over-production.<br/><br/>Anyway.

It was another brilliant morning in Malta, the gorgeous white sunlight not yet hot as it lanced through the pellucid air. Ruby limped down to the docks to check on the <i>Brightening Dawn.</i> <br/><br/>She found several soldiers climbing over it, painting over the brilliant crimson color of the plane with dull gray paint. The Sparrow was supervising them. When she saw Ruby, she ambled over to shake her hand. "Good," she said to the American, "you're ready. We'll leave as soon as the paint dries."<br/><br/>"Leave? For where?'<br/><br/>"India. Where your friend is being taken."<br/><br/>There was a long pause filled only by the cries of fishmongers and the shrieks of gulls.<br/><br/>"You see, I've done quite a bit of damage to your cause," said the Sparrow apologetically. "I'm determined to repair that by putting my resources at your disposal. With Millicent's people traveling by ship through the Suez Canal, we can steal a march on them--with relief crews, and using British airbases, we can get to Delhi several days in advance."<br/><br/>"And then fly to Thibet?"<br/><br/>"Ah...no. There's a point beyond which you have to walk. But don't worry, you'll have a few days to rest up. And there's nothing like a good hike to restore your constitution!"<br/><br/>Ruby groaned.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>The Sparrow was true to her word. They left at dawn the next day, and went through a whirlwind tour of the British Middle East: Cairo, Jerusalem, Tehran, Karachi...and finally Delhi. They took a train through the United Provinces as far north as they could, and then met their party of drovers and musk oxen for the long trip up and over the Tethys range.<br/><br/>As they drifted through the high villages, Ruby made a point of talking with the locals, even picking up a little of the various languages of the region. Over a meal of stew or rice, she always asked about the local monasteries, trying to suss out where Millicent was being taken.<br/><br/>In one village, the headman casually said, "You must be heading to our monastery."<br/><br/>"Oh? Why?"<br/><br/>"Because a bunch of white ladies show up there from time to time. Usually more than one. I guess you're important."<br/><br/>"You have no idea."<br/><br/><i>[Oral History spend by Ruby.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>For Millicent, the journey had gone past in a blur. Everyone around her was so deferential, so polite, so willing to please. She barely had to ask for anything before it came to her! She would have been happy...had it not been for her "sister", who was going by the name of Mirabelle.<br/><br/>Mirabelle kept giving her discrete looks of pure hate. <br/><br/>When they reached the monastery--a cramped complex of wattled towers with pagoda roofs clinging to the side of a sheer cliff, a narrow valley thousands of feet below them--she finally got Mirabelle alone long enough to talk to her.<br/><br/>"You...you were <i>dead</i>...how are you alive? Not that I'm not glad, but <i>how</i>?"<br/><br/>"Not so easy to kill this body, I guess."<br/><br/>"How long have you had it?"<br/><br/>"As long as you...haven't."<br/><br/>"So...I have your body, and you have mine?"<br/><br/>"Oh, no no no. You have my <i>brain</i>, and I'm going to take it back."<br/><br/>"I don't think it can be your brain..."<br/><br/>"No, I'm pretty sure it can be."<br/><br/><i>[RP: This is a crazy person conversation!</i><br/><i>Me: Not for Millicent...]</i><br/><br/>"So how do I have your brain?" asked a stunned Millicent.<br/><br/>"Somebody took it out."<br/><br/>"Then...what brain do you have?"<br/><br/>"Odds and ends," said Mirabelle with a wolfish grin.<br/><br/>"Then what came out of the grave?"<br/><br/>"A little girl's body. But I got better. I was dead for a long time...but you know what they say, 'That which is dead...'"<br/><br/>"So Uncle Freddy buried you in the ground?"<br/><br/>"That's what Momma told me."<br/><br/>On cue, Vanessa Brady swept in, wearing a long gown embroidered with esoteric symbols. "Girls, girls, please don't argue. We've made so many mistakes! Why did I ever fear the Dark Lord? I was always his favorite! And now we\u2019re finally all going to be together."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452156/#Comment_452156" name="Item_282" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-12T05:15:45+00:00" title="April 12, 2016  5:15AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I like my version of the final confrontation better and it certainly was a better fit for this group; when Lisa ran EL for me, I did find that part a bit underwhelming, through no fault of her own--I'm not a huge fan of how it is written in the actual text, and Gumshoe contests are really not an awesome mechanic, at least not the way the are laid out in the text.

And, because we were getting into it, each round the thing lasted meant everyone had to reach for even better description, unsure whether there'd be another round or not, and I don't really like "the target number is always 4; first to fail loses". I can't quite phrase why I don't like it, but I think I feel it lacks proper drama. Or something. I'm guessing this isn't one of the things that will change in 2nd edition Trail, whenever that becomes a thing, as it doesn't feel like something that's actually broken.

She wondered if they were always like this. She had to sit on an elaborately carved wooden throne on a dais, flanked by smaller thrones for Vanessa and Mirabelle. They were all wearing elaborate gowns and headdresses. Around them danced the women of Epsilon Sigma, chanting and singing, pausing frequently to give brief, anodyne testimonials. At one point they even handed out awards.<br/><br/>"Shouldn't we be getting on with it already?" whispered Millicent at Mirabelle.<br/><br/>"You'll get yours soon."<br/><br/>At one point, however, the dance and the chanting took on a different character: the notes became lower, richer, with more convoluted harmonies. And she could feel something happening: some loosening of a tension that she had carried with her for so long that she hadn't been aware of it until the moment it lessened. She felt as though a breeze of fresh air was washing over her, or like the sun had come out from behind a cloud...some revelation of what it was to truly feel.<br/><br/>And not far away, Jimmy felt the last vestiges of the binding and shielding spells he had put on Millicent eleven years ago crumble away.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>It happened while they were approaching the monastery from above, according to their typically improvised plan. "The thing is, Geronimo," Jimmy had told the Spaniard, "we have to go in and get her out...or she doesn't come out at all. If we can't get her out, then she'll either die at their hands or ours. Let's try to avoid that."<br/><br/>"They've broken the safeguards," he told the rest as they walked. "The things I put on her to keep her from being seen by Nyarlathotep."<br/><br/>"Why don't we steal robes and sneak in?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Because Doc Orange and I look terrible in lipstick," said Jimmy. "Besides, you have a really memorable feature."<br/><br/><i>[Stealth and Athletics checks came in here, with everyone piggybacking on both of them.]</i><br/><br/>They slid down the slope using ropes to brake and then swung down from the cliff onto one of the pagoda towers. As they ducked inside, they saw a thunderstorm moving rapidly up the valley toward them.<br/><br/>They made their way down until they came to a loft space directly above the gallery. They watched the dancing and chanting for a few minutes. To their surprise, people began to file out of the gallery, leaving only Millicent, Mirabelle, and Vanessa below.<br/><br/>Jimmy glanced up. Through the windows of the tower they had descended, he saw a white light drop down out of the thunderclouds. There was a flash of lightning, and then he heard something land on the roof with a heavy scrabble of claws.<br/><br/>A moment later that <i>something</i> jumped through the window and extended its iridescent scaled wings--four, at least--buzzing faster than the eye could track. It was about the height of a human being, but it had at least three pairs of legs descending from its bloated, segmented body. The head was a frightful congery of pincers, tentacles, and antennae, with two huge compound eyes that reflected the light back in broken prisms of horror.<br/><br/>Jimmy rolled over. "A Mi-Go," he groaned. "I hate those guys."<br/><br/>Mirabelle approached the alien and clapped her hands in a business-like manner. "C'mon, let's get with the brain swapping," she said.<br/><br/>Millicent began to scream.<br/><br/>The alien pressed a button on a small box mounted on its chest, which buzzed for a little bit and then barked out in a mechanical voice, "WE CANNOT DO THIS."<br/><br/>"Why?" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"YOUR BODY IS NOT TERRENE MATTER."<br/><br/>Millicent gasped, and then fainted.<br/><br/>"What do you mean?" shouted Mirabelle, rounding on the alien. "How can she not be terrene matter?"<br/><br/>"SHE IS DREAMFORM. THE EMPLACEMENT IS MISSING."<br/><br/>Up in the gallery, Jimmy whispered "What the hell?" to Ruby.<br/><br/>"It's...possible for a dreamform to walk out of the Dreaming..." said Ruby. "I mean, Charlie told me that. She'd look just like a human, breathe, eat, everything...but...I know that she was a real human back when we met her. When did she change?"<br/><br/><i>[Cthulhu Mythos spend by RP, 2 point Stability loss.]</i><br/><br/>"Don't know. Don't care." Jimmy chambered a round into his bolt-action rifle and shot Mirabelle.<br/><br/>It was a good shot, catching her center mass and knocking her back. But as she stumbled back, her form began to change, expanding, her human nature draining away as she began to morph into a hideous orange colored beast, ten feet long and roughly triangular, with five heads filled with pickets of sharp needle teeth running in random locations down her back. A long, sinewy, crimson tentacle lashed through the air in front of her, and two enormous, baleful yellow eyes gazed around from the apex of her body. A twitching mat of tentacles sprouted from the base of her body, pulling her forward, leaving a trail of glowing orange slime in her wake.<br/><br/><i>[This is the monstrous form of the spawn of Nyarlathotep from </i>Masks of Nyarlathotep<i>. I couldn't find a place to have Mirabelle make an appearance this way when I ran that campaign, so I was happy to squeeze her in now.]</i><br/><br/>The Mirabelle-Monster looked up into the rafters. A hideous pink beam of some vile liquid shot out of her left eye, striking Geronimo and burning his arm. The caustic splash ate through the beams below him, and he dropped with a crash to the floor.<br/><br/>With a flurry of buzzing movement, the Mi-Go rose in the air and landed on the rafter beams near Jimmy. Ruby rolled over and shot it in the head, and it fell to the ground dead.<br/><br/><i>[I let players spend points before the roll to do extra damage; RP spent all Ruby's Firearms to automatically hit and then do as much damage as possible.]</i><br/><br/>Dr. Orange took careful aim and plugged the Mirabelle-Monster in center mass, a peach of a shot that plowed a divot in its skin. The creature shrieked, shambled over to the window, and flowed back into human form. Mirabelle crawled through the window...and leapt into the night.<br/><br/>There was a hideous shriek from outside. Jimmy and Dr. Orange looked out of the nearest window in the attic. They saw an elephant-sized creature, some kind monstrous <i>thing</i> that looked like a cross between a pterodactyl and a plucked chicken. Jimmy groaned again. "Byakhee...I hate those guys too..."<br/><br/>"Look, more lights are coming down from the cloud," said Dr. Orange. "And the monastery is on fire...based on the construction and prevailing winds, we had better try to get out to the southwest."<br/><br/><i>[Physics spend by the Doc to know the best route to escape the fire; I gave the group a 3-Point "Escape the Monastery" pool.</i><br/><br/><i>I also seemed to have messed up here; I should have hit everyone with the Extra Mind Rending from seeing a monstrous form of Nyarlathotep.</i><br/><br/><i>I was experimenting with a system this session where if the roll was less than the TN you got a partial success; it didn't work all that well, but I used it to generate some consequences.]</i><br/><br/>They all dropped down to the stage. Geronimo picked up Millicent and slung her over his back. Jimmy swept Ruby up and carried her out through the flames, choking on the thick smoke. As he followed them down one of the walkways above the central courtyard, Geronimo saw a couple of the monks and one of the women from Epsilon Sigma trapped behind a burning beam in a corner of the atrium.<br/><br/>"Help us!" the woman shrieked, tears streaming down her face.<br/><br/>Geronimo paused. He imagined he could hear a distant keening in his mind, the pull of the Sword to defend the helpless. He looked down on them, and whispered <i>No</i>.<br/><br/>He turned to follow the others, deaf to the screams behind him.<br/><br/><i>[Soft Driver on Geronimo's Sword Statement; 2 points of Stability loss.]</i><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452179/#Comment_452179" name="Item_286" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-13T02:13:08+00:00" title="April 13, 2016  2:13AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.

After that, they headed west, into Thibet. Towards Kailash.<br/><br/>This took a while. They tramped the narrow ways of the high Himalayas, camping out in towns as they passed through them, gradually becoming acclimated to the 4000 meter altitude. They passed through Lhasa and stayed at an inn near a Buddhist shrine. Jimmy and Dr. Orange watched a sand painting being made the following day.<br/><br/>Millicent tried to have a talk with Jimmy about what had happened to her.

Like a lot of Germans of his generation, Dr. Orange was an alpinist and used that as a way to talk to as many of the local climbers as possible.<br/><br/>It soon became apparent that it would be impossible for them to find a shall we say <i>conscientious</i> guide interested in committing sacrilege against four major religions. The good doctor began to concentrate on the less savory climbers they met. In one village, he finally got a lead, from a grizzled old sharp boy who had been living fat on English expeditions for decades.<br/><br/>"The only person who would be crazy enough to even think about something like climbing Kailash would be a Sherpa who was on the Ruttledge expedition. Guy named Satan Sherpa." He pronounced it with long <i>aahs</i>: Saahtaahn Sherpa. Dr. Orange's eyes bugged a bit at the name, but he thanked the man and headed back to the others.<br/><br/><i>[Streetwise spend by OP. And yes, I did not make that name up, it's in the Wikipedia article.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>"A long time ago," Jimmy said one night, when they were bedding down in a Thibetan house, "there was a sorcerer's duel near Mount Kailash. Between Naro B\xf6n-Chung, who was a magician and priest of the B\xf6n religion, and Milarepa, a Bodhisattva. They battled for days, but neither could get any advantage. Finally, they decided to race to the top of Mount Kailash. Naro B\xf6n-Chung leapt into the air and flew towards the summit, while Milarepa remained seated in meditation at the base. But when Naro reached the top of the mountain, he found Milarepa sitting there."<br/><br/>"So we should meditate to get to the top of the mountain?" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"I think that only works if you're a Buddhist saint. Don't get any ideas."<br/><br/><i>[Occult use by JP.]</i><br/><br/>"There are two lakes below the mountain," said Millicent, sharing her research. "One is called Manasarovar, it's a freshwater lake. The waters are supposed to be sacred, and give blessing to anyone who bathes in them."<br/><br/>Dr. Orange was going through a packet of papers that had been forwarded to him from Joy Grove. He stared at the photographs of Edgar Job's scribblings on the walls of his room. They seemed to lay out, in precise detail, a theory of time travel; the math was very well worked out. One wall was filled with Job's speculation on how to build a time machine (the materials were not immediately available) that gave Julius the feeling that he could unravel the mysteries of the Xochul pyramid's time machine.<br/><br/>The last photos were the most chilling: Job laid out a great deal of theory of closed time-like loops, including tests to figure out whether or not one was actually <i>inside</i> one of them. But why was Job interested in such things?<br/><br/><i>[2 point Physics spend by OP; Doc Orange had been carrying around this packet for a while now.]</i><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452196/#Comment_452196" name="Item_289" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-14T16:56:46+00:00" title="April 14, 2016  4:56PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XV: Heart of Darkness Alibi (Part 4)</b><br/><br/>Jimmy and Millicent hired a guide to take them around and look for Satan Sherpa. They discovered there were a lot of stories about him, most dealing with his rather irrational behavior. Eventually, they tracked him down to a Buddhist monastery, where he was being imprisoned.<br/><br/><i>[Oral History spend by MP.]</i><br/><br/>"What did you do?" said Millicent when they were brought in to see him.<br/><br/>"What did I not do, memsahib!" said Satan. He was a short man with a small triangular beard, very black hair, and a potbelly. His arms looked powerful, the results of years of climbing.<br/><br/>"They have so many statues of the Buddha," continued Satan. "So one broke. So I tried to sell one to foreigners. Is that a crime?"<br/><br/>"Yes!" said Millicent. Jimmy sighed and went to talk to the Abbot.<br/><br/>When they left the monastery his wallet was considerably lighter, but they brought Satan Sherpa with them.<i> </i><br/><br/><i>[1-point Bargain spend.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>"So what do you need the services of a reprobate such as myself for?" asked Satan when he met the rest of them.<br/><br/>"That's not a nice way to talk about your mother," said Dr. Orange, to the bafflement of everyone.<br/><br/>"I'm afraid I don't speak English...as poorly as you."<br/><br/>"We want you to do something no God-fearing people would do," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"We want to go to the top of Mount Kailash," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Mount Kailash...the holiest mountain in the world...the source of Mata Ganga, the holiest river in the world," said Satan slowly. "You wish to get to the top of this mountain--the mountain <i>God</i> lives on?"<br/><br/>"Yes," said everyone.<br/><br/>"Excellent. I myself wish to climb this mountain and show my arse to God."<br/><br/>"I like him," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"He has a certain <i>je ne sais exactly what it is</i>," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"God has done nothing for me," said Satan. "If we meet Shiva on the mountain, I'm sure we can deal with him. I will tell you what you need. You will need rope. You will need equipment. You will need oxygen. These things I can find for you. You must only use the oxygen in an emergency. You <i>will</i> use the oxygen. Fortunately for you, when I was there with Sahib Rutledge I mapped a route to the shoulder of the mountain. We will climb in three phases. First is the ridge approach. This will take a day or three. Then we must ascend to the shoulder of the mountain; this will take another few days. Finally we will assault the summit itself. Are any of you especially susceptible to altitude sickness?"<br/><br/>"I have no idea," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"We will find out."<br/><br/><i>[At this point I handed out my Climbing Mount Kailash chart. I probably made this a bit too complicated--certainly the rules for altitude sickness could be cleaned up and simplified. In play the daily challenges weren't that awesome or interesting--I modeled it after the Dungeon World "Take a Dangerous Journey" move, but that's always been somewhat problematical for me in play. Still, there are the germs of some good ideas here that I might develop further given the chance.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>After many days of hiking, they reached Darchen, the last town before Mount Kailash. Like much of the Tibetan plateau, the land was flat and brown and surrounded by high mountains. Darchen itself was a small camp surrounded by pilgrims and their tents, with prayer flags flapping in the bitter winds.<br/><br/>Ahead of them they saw two lakes, Rakshastal and Manasarovar, the salty lake of the demon and the crystal clear holy lake. Behind them loomed the hunchbacked prominence of Mount Kailash, like shark's tooth or a ship's prow thrust into the light of the rising sun.<br/><br/>"Bathing in the waters of Manasarovar is supposed to wash away sins," Satan told them. "You may do so, after a brief prayer ceremony. <br/><br/>Geronimo was the first volunteer. He waded out into the freezing water and stood in the cold sunlight, waiting. Then he turned back to the shore.<br/><br/>"What did you see?" asked Ruby.<br/><br/>Geronimo smiled and caressed her face. "That we will be fine. Together."<br/><br/>Ruby watched him walk away, then waded out herself. "I want..." she thought, "I want to see my daughter graduating from school. That she'll be all right..."<br/><br/>She looked down at her reflection and inhaled sharply. Her image still had a left arm, and seemed to be regarding her curiously. Then the breeze picked up and her reflection vanished.<br/><br/>Dr. Orange didn't expect to see anything; he was a man of science. It wasn't until he turned back for shore that he saw something out of the ordinary. For a moment, his vision grew unstable and he saw everything as if there were hundreds of images superimposed on each other, each one just slightly out of synch with the rest. Then his eyes cleared and there was nothing but the barren plains and white sunlight.<br/><br/>When Millicent stood in the water, she had a vision. She saw everyone except Geronimo lying on the floor of the Xochul pyramid, unconscious.<br/><br/><i>[Stability refreshes here, as these hit against Statements. Everyone but Geronimo (who got 2) and Millicent (who got 0) got back a point of Stability.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>"We run short of time," Satan intoned that night. "The monsoon will be coming soon. In India, it will rain. Here it will snow."<br/><br/>Ruby was testing out the modified arm Dr. Orange had rigged up for her; it had an ascender attachment that would allow her to climb using her good arm. It also had an untested ice axe attachment.<br/><br/>"We could use that to our advantage," continued the Sherpa. "It will be considerably easier for us to make the ascent undetected if we do it during a storm."<br/><br/>"That's insane," said Jimmy. Satan shrugged.<br/><br/><i>[I offered them a chance to make the Stealth check easier by making the Athletics check harder for the first stage, but they didn't bite.]</i><br/><br/>Their plan was to follow the Outer Kora, the prayer route around the mountain followed by pilgrims. It crossed at one point a high pass that Satan planned to use as the springboard for climbing up onto the eastern ridge; they could hide in the area during the night and then make their first attempt at night.<br/><br/>They rested a few days in Darchen to prepare. Dr. Orange convinced a group of pilgrims to let them meditate with them, and then make the Kora route with them.<br/><br/><i>[They took their Refuge refreshes here, since this is probably the last place you can do so.

It wasn't hard to act like they couldn't keep up with the Thibetans and Indians--mostly since it was hardly subterfuge; five thousand meters was still higher than they were really accustomed to, even after weeks in Thibet.<br/><br/>They let Satan guide them off the kora and up into the badlands and rugged terrain that surrounded the mountain itself. Following Millicent's lead, they managed to keep themselves hidden from the passing groups of pilgrims and slowly ascend the long eastern spur of Mount Kailash. They made camp that night--hardly a cheery affair--in a low depression surrounded by boulders.<br/><br/><i>[Stealth check here by MP with everyone piggybacking...except Ruby, of course, who still has no Stealth.]</i><br/><br/>The next morning Jimmy awoke with a pounding headache. He felt sick to his stomach, and had trouble waking up fully. Satan soon confirmed his fears: he had altitude sickness.<br/><br/><i>[If you look at the handout, you can see I was trying out a three-tiered success system here in the style of Apocalypse World; this was one of the few places it hit, a partial on Millicent's Stealth check resulted in Jimmy getting sick.]</i><br/><br/>Millicent set out to take the first pitch but Jimmy cut her off. "I'll lead," he said gruffly.<br/><br/>"But Mr. Wright--"<br/><br/>Jimmy shook her off and set out with Satan Sherpa. Breaking trail was an ordeal for him all that day, but he was able to rest during the stretches when they could cut across the ice ridges. The technically challenging climbing was still ahead of them.<br/><br/>They slowly made their way across the ice bridges and rock, the tumbling seracs and the gravelly remains of landslides. The mountain came closer and closer until after two grueling days they reached the lower slopes.<br/><br/>Geronimo did most of the cooking. He had somehow contrived to bring some dehydrated bisque that when mixed with rice tasted vaguely like--<br/><br/>"Himalayan paella?" said Ruby.<br/><br/>"For my queen, of course."<br/><br/>He also brewed up some coca tea which was the only thing keeping Jimmy wired together. He had already begun to sneak hits off of his emergency oxygen.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>Despite his illness, Jimmy helped break trail with Satan Sherpa the next morning, the first truly difficult climbing they had done so far. Sheer walls of rock surrounded them, but they managed to find belay points and pull themselves laboriously up meter by meter.<br/><br/>Millicent managed the rope supplies and proved a prodigy at finding their best routes, especially when they had to pull on crampons and do real ice climbing. This was the hardest for Ruby, and Geronimo ended up rigging a harness for her to his back and dragged her up the slippery cliffs.<br/><br/>At sunset of the second day they were perched precariously on a shoulder of the mountain, six thousand meters above sea level, at the edge of the final slopes that lead to the summit. Crumpled ridges lay below them as far as they could see, covered with snow that looked like peach ice cream in the dying light, drowning in deep seas of purple dusk.<br/><br/>Jimmy didn't pay any attention to it at all. Pain pounded behind his eyes. He stared up at the myriad stars as they shone down mercilessly on him.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>Long before dawn they began their summit bid. Only Satan was in good spirits, looking forward to conquering the sacred mountain. They crunched their way through the snowfields, picking their way over the rock outcrops, doing serious ice climbing only in the few places where the path dropped away.<br/><br/>Eventually, they came to a dell about a hundred meters below the summit. Jimmy and Satan reached it first, and waited to show what they had found. It was most unusual.<br/><br/>Around the lip of the dell were four statues, carved with incredible delicacy from the very bones of the mountain. They were men in robes, each in a different style. One of them had a bow.<br/><br/>"I think this is the place we need to cast the spell," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"You mean among the statues on the unclimbable mountains?" said Ruby. "Good bet."<br/><br/>"I guess I'm up," grumbled Dr. Orange. He unwrapped the parchment they had stolen in Malta. "Once again, may I point out that this is all bullshit? Physics indeed."<br/><br/><i>[The TN to cast the spell was lower if you make a Physics spend.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy began to read in a faltering voice from the parchment. Gradually his voice grew stronger, the syllables rolling off his tongue in ringing tones.<br/><br/>"Not his first rodeo, is it?" said Satan. Millicent nodded. She gathered around with the others and shed some blood into the snow.<br/><br/>Clouds began to gather around the mountain. There was an ozone smell in the air, and St. Elmo's fire began to glow on the tips of their ice axes. As the wind picked up, Dr. Orange took out his compass and watched the needle spinning around rapidly.<br/><br/>They heard an enormous <i>CRACK</i>. The ice between them and the summit began to split and then widen, revealing a long flight of stairs. To Ruby's experienced eyes, they bore a bizarre resemblance to the steps on the side of the pyramid in Chichen Xoxul. She moved forward a bit to take a closer look.<br/><br/>So it was that she was the first to see the statues come to life.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452257/#Comment_452257" name="Item_292" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-18T15:24:31+00:00" title="April 18, 2016  3:24PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XV: Heart of Darkness Alibi (Part 6)</b><br/><br/>It happened all at once. The silent stone was suddenly flesh, the figures already moving into action. Two she recognized almost immediately, from her research on the mountain: assuredly the man in the simple robes with the wooden prayer beads tied around his wrist was Milarepa, the saint, while the man in the more ornate robes heavily inscribed with Tibetan characters could only be his old opponent, Naro B\xf6n-Chung.<br/><br/>Jimmy's training in the occult and world mythology helped him identify the other two: the thin ascetic looked a lot like the depictions of Rishabha, the founder of Jainism, while the blue-skinned man with the bow looked like any number of paintings of Rudra he had seen.<br/><br/>Milarepa jumped off his podium and almost faster than the eye could see launched himself at Ruby, pushing her backwards across the snow and ice. She could barely stay upright as she skidded backwards toward a precipice. She struck out blindly with her artificial arm, connecting with the flesh of the saint. He vanished in a blur of speed and she fell to the ground, the ice axe attached to her arm embedding itself in the glacier, arresting her fall at the very edge of the void.<br/><br/>Geronimo had already swept out his sword. He raised it and began to stalk toward Rishabha. The figure of the Jain looked at him, eyes burning like coals, and Geronimo lowered his sword. The profound depths of <i>ahimsa</i>, non-violence, enfolded him and for the first time in a long while he felt at peace.<br/><br/><i>[This was a soft driver against one of Geronimo's Statements.]</i><br/><br/>Dr. Orange was struck by an arrow; it grazed his side, causing quite a bit of blood to spurt onto the snow. Rudra was perched on a spur of rock, balancing on one foot, already drawing back his recurved composite bow. Dr. Orange pulled out his pistol and pumped a couple of rounds into the figure of the deity, who, unperturbed, began to open his third eye.<br/><br/>"This is madness," said Jimmy. "We can't shoot our way out of it. Think! We need to sacrifice to them! Or find a spell to get rid of them!<br/><br/><i>[I gave them this based on their high amount of training, and because it\u2019s more fun for them to try and fulfill the conditions for the dismissal of the Guardians that I wrote.]</i><br/><br/>Ruby stared at Rishabha.  She knew what she must do.<br/><br/>"I renounce the use of weapons today," she said, and bowed.<br/><br/>Rishabha folded his hands in a peace symbol and froze back into stone.<br/><br/>She turned to Geronimo. "Shiva is a god of sexuality and death," she said to Geronimo, stalking toward him. "Get ready to join the mile-high club."<br/><br/>"<i>What</i>?" said Geronimo.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>Jimmy danced back as Naro B\xf6n-Chung unleashed a gout of fire from his hands. Somewhere in the driving snow Milarepa was racing around. "Doc!" he shouted.<br/><br/>"<i>Ja</i>, I see," said Dr. Orange. "What do you think will get rid of him."<br/><br/>"He's a sorcerer! Maybe we have to accept magic!"<br/><br/>"That's ridiculous! That's..." Dr. Orange stopped in place. "Wait...magic...it's been working all along...I...<i>physics is wrong</i>!"<br/><br/><i>[Naro B\xf6n-Chung's sacrifice was a point of Sanity.]</i><br/><br/>Milarepa came to a sudden stop in front of Jimmy. His mind raced...Milarepa had been a practitioner of tantric Buddhism, of radical renunciation...<br/><br/>Without a word, he handed him his rabbit's foot. The saint bowed, and froze into stone.<br/><br/><i>[JP made a Cthulhu Mythos spend to get the last two sacrifices; Milarepa's was "voluntarily sacrifice a Source of Stability." All of them also had rituals to dismiss them, but nobody went for those.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy stalked back to the others, who were trying to watch-without-looking Geronimo and Ruby rolling around in the snow. "When they're done, follow me," he said to the rest and began limping up the staircase.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>The stone was obsidian, maybe, or perhaps some kind of alien substance. Certainly it was slick and hard to climb. The others soon caught up to him, Geronimo with a sheepishly guilty look on his face.<br/><br/><i>[Twas a TN 3 Athletics check to make it to the top. They were still at 6700 meters.]</i><br/><br/>They climbed higher and higher, often on all fours. Below them they could see Satan waving at them. They turned back and after a long time they reached the summit. An open-faced structure, remarkably like the top of the pyramid of Chichen Xochul. They crawled inside, out of the wind, and began tending to their wounds.<br/><br/>It didn't take Millicent long to find the same altar mechanism they had found in the Yucatan. They filled the bowl with snow until it sprang the trap door, and crawled down into a room that was very familiar.<br/><br/>Through slits in the walls they could see the towering mountains around them.<br/><br/>Jimmy leaned against the wall. The pain in his head was blinding. Dr. Orange slapped him on his back. "Cheer up, Jimmy. We'd never have gotten this far without you. You're the only one who has dealt with anything like this before."<br/><br/>Jimmy shook his head. It hurt when he did that too. "That man is dead."<br/><br/><i>[Jimmy's new Statement is "The man I was is dead." Since he gave up his Symbol, I could drive this Statement, but he couldn't recover anything from it. </i><br/><br/><i>This bit is me papering over Psychoanalytic Triage done by the Doc.]</i><br/><br/>There was something by his foot. He reached down and picked up a very corroded coin. He used his penknife to cut some of the verdigris off of it.<br/><br/>It was a 1937 US penny...but one that looked at least two thousand years old.<br/><br/>"Mr. Wright, come and look," shouted Millicent. Jimmy dragged himself over to the center of the room. Cut into the floor was a hole, shaped like a giant, lipless, fanged mouth. Jagged teeth covered the entire shaft as far as their light could reach.<br/><br/>They rigged up a hoist and lowered themselves down the pit slowly, lanterns first.

Jimmy mostly noticed that the air got strangely thicker and his headache rapidly got better. The moist air was redolent of the smell of Nectar, and thick mists blew around them. After a while, driven by the malign will of the Liar, they soon were separated, calling each other's names, lost in a strange brick labyrinth.<br/><br/>Jimmy was the first to get his senses back. Pressing his hat down on his head, he began a circle search through the strange and twisted rooms of the labyrinth. He saw many horrors...but eventually found Millicent, in the most terrible room he had yet seen.<br/><br/>The floor of the room was thick with blood, slime, and sweat. The air was heavy and dense, humid and warm, and low moans and shrieks could be heard as if from far away or underground. Dangling from ropy cords of flesh were several bodies. At first glance they appeared to be human, but a closer inspection showed that they were all malformed\u2014skin hanging loosely from their faces, or their features slowly losing their shape like dough springing back. Several had mouth-like orifices slowly gaping on their limbs or torso.<br/><br/>Millicent was standing in the middle of the room. Several of the ropy cords were attached to her, and slime covered her body. Her flesh pulsated disturbingly.<br/><br/>"I'll get you out of this," he said to her. He pulled on one of the fleshy ropes. She tried to hide how much it was hurting her.<br/><br/>"I could do the thing," she said helpfully.<br/><br/>"Do not do the thing!" He pulled out his utility knife and began hacking the ropes free. Blood and slime poured out of them. Millicent bit her tongue and tried not to scream.<br/><br/>Finally he sliced through the last rope. He wiped off his forehead as Millicent stepped free, and turned around. One of the doughy body forms was dangling near him. He could see his own features begin to form on its face, down to the brim of his hat beginning to grow out of its forehead.<br/><br/>He smiled. The creature smiled back. Then Jimmy drew his pistol and put a hole in its head.<br/><br/>He and Millicent fled into the passageways.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>After a long, timeless interval, they found Ruby.<br/><br/>She was standing in the middle of the room, a beckoning smile frozen on her face. All around them glowed a pink, pearly light. The heavy smell of Nectar permeated the air. On the floor and against the walls of the room were couples (and larger sets) of people copulating ecstatically. As they watched, some seemed to be slowly absorbed into the walls of the room, which were some kind of soft substance with an oily sheen. Sometimes too protuberances erupted slowly from the walls in the form of entwined human bodies.<br/><br/><i>[Hit Ruby with a Hard Driver to not drink Nectar.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy reached out to grab her shoulder. Ruby swept it off. "Get away from me! I know you're there! I can hear the whispers! You can't make me drink it!"<br/><br/>"We can get her out of here without moving her," said Millicent. Jimmy waved a finger menacingly at her.<br/><br/>"Ruby," he said. "It's Jimmy."<br/><br/>"This is a place of lies, James," said Ruby in a bored voice. "You'll have to try a little bit harder than your name."<br/><br/>"We had that absolutely ridiculous film setup, and I saved you from that occultist--well, you thought it was me, but it wasn't. I would never mess up the shot. It was Geronimo. We have to go find him now."<br/><br/>"He wants to marry you, remember?" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"That's true," said Ruby dubiously. "Let me cover my eyes." She raised her prosthetic limb up over her face.<br/><br/>Jimmy grabbed her hand and they made their way toward the exit. Some of the bodies began to flow in their direction, blocking their way. Jimmy grimaced, drew his knife, and slashed them all viciously down.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452379/#Comment_452379" name="Item_296" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T16:42:46+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  4:42PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XV: Heart of Darkness Alibi (Part 8)</b><br/><br/>Geronimo was the next one they found.<br/><br/>He was standing very still in the middle of a chamber that looked like the inside of a mouth; the walls were red and flesh and covered in saliva. Every surface of the room had multiple horrid lipless mouths sunken into it, bristling with broken, jagged teeth. Sometimes saw-edged tongues flicked out of these mouths, quickly like a lizard or slow as a snake on a cold day. Spittle fell smoking to the floor when they did. The air was horribly damp and still; the slightest tremor in it caused mouths to open and tongues to lash out.<br/><br/>"Geronimo, darling," hissed Ruby.<br/><br/>"Where?" said Geronimo loudly. The Mouths began to whisper and chatter.<br/><br/>"Sound of my voice. Follow it."<br/><br/>"You're lying! I can't give in!"<br/><br/>"It's me, Ruby!"<br/><br/>"That is not the voice of my Ruby!"<br/><br/>"Geronimo," said Ruby, crossly, "would you please listen to me and not the lying Elder God? We do not have time for anymore dilly-dallying. Do you understand me?"<br/><br/>"That is kind of like Ruby," mused Geronimo.<br/><br/>"You wonderful, beautiful, obstinate pain in my ass, would you listen to my words? Stay put. We're coming. Don't slash at the first thing that feels like a human hand--I'm running a little low."<br/><br/>Ruby and Millicent followed Jimmy as he carefully picked his way across the room. "Geronimo, it's Jimmy. We're coming."<br/><br/><i>[Reassurance spend by JP here, followed by a Stealth check.]</i><br/><br/>The Mouths mostly remained quiescent. They had almost reached the exit when Ruby's heel broke. Instantly they felt razor-sharp tongues lashing at them. Their clothes shredded under the assault, but they were able to make a last push out of the chamber and into the obscuring mist.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>They wandered for a very long time after that before they found Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>He was standing, with a beatific grin on his face, in a room that seemed entirely made of mother of pearl. A dim light shone through the walls, creating a shadowless space where everything seemed to float. The floor, walls, and even ceiling had been waxed with a soft, translucent substance, making everything difficult to find purchase on. The entire room vibrated with the music and song of what could only be described as a heavenly choir\u2014their wordless chants seemed to promise peace, rest, and infinite compassion.<br/><br/>"Dr. Orange," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"How did I get here?" said the German. "This room seems so different."<br/><br/>"It's probably a lie," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Well, we were separated, but now we're all back together, that's great," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"I think he's a clone," said Geronimo to Jimmy. "He's too nice."<br/><br/>"Do you guys hear that?" said the doctor. "I think if I stayed a while, I could understand it...but I guess it's not what we're here for."<br/><br/><i>[Soft Driver on the Doc, who took the Stability loss.]</i><br/><br/>Jimmy closed his eyes, feeling the music wash over him. He could hear his own voice in the chorus, and Francis telling him how he was proud of him. He sighed.<br/><br/>"I haven't talked to Francis in ten years," he said to himself. "I keep saying we're friends, but I don't think it's true anymore." He began moving toward the exit.<br/><br/><i>[Same for Jimmy--a refused Soft Driver.]</i><br/><br/>Ruby realized, as she stood in the pure white light, that for the first time in...forever, it seemed...she had absolutely no desire to consume Nectar.<br/><br/>Tears filled her eyes. "Either way I'm trapped, either here or by my addiction." She moved forward.<br/><br/><i>[Also a Soft Driver!]</i><br/><br/>Millicent, for what it was worth, felt absolutely normal. "That's the greatest lie of all," she said, and left with the rest.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452472/#Comment_452472" name="Item_297" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-21T15:44:46+00:00" title="April 21, 2016  3:44PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 21, 2016 3:45PM by Aviatrix.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XV: Heart of Darkness Alibi (Part 9)</b><br/><br/>They wandered for a long time through the maze. Dr. Orange's experience in mathematical topology helped guide them closer and closer to the center. Their food ran low, and even with rationing they were almost out of water.<br/><br/>They came to a blank brick wall.<br/><br/>"The center of the maze is behind this," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>Jimmy and Geronimo used their ice axes as improvised picks, wedging open cracks with their pitons. After a couple of hours they were able to smash open a hole large enough to squeeze through.<br/><br/>The room beyond the wall was glowing with a horrible red light. Suspended in an enormous cavern was a gigantic, beating, human heart, easily the size of a house or larger. Veins and arteries branched off of it, hanging like bridge cables from the ceiling, where they connected to flaccid sac-like stomachs which pulsed with peristalsis.<br/><br/>The air was absolutely clogged with the smell of Nectar, but even Ruby felt no compulsion to take it. Not in the presence of this titanic horror. All of them felt their minds reel. Nothing could have prepared them for this.<br/><br/><i>[Indeed. This was a 6-point Stability loss, which brought three PCs to negative Stability; the Liar makes any Sanity loss two points worse, so they all went down 3 points of Sanity.]</i><br/><br/>Kneeling in front of the enormous heart was a human figure. As they came near, they were shocked to see that it was Millicent, her head lolling around senselessly. Jimmy turned back to the girl he had found in the bloody room.<br/><br/>"Oh," she said, the spell loosening. "I'm not real, am I."<br/><br/>Millicent--the real Millicent--stood up. She looked at the rest of them with dazed eyes.<br/><br/>Jimmy grabbed the duplicate by her shoulders. "Please just make my day," he growled, and shoved her forward.<br/><br/>"I'm coming," she said.<br/><br/><i>[Intimidate spend by JP. As a reward for everyone playing along with fake Millicent, they got to hold 3 to do stuff, most importantly to pass dismissal checks during the upcoming ritual.]</i> <br/><br/>Geronimo seized the...not original...maybe not real...<i>their</i> Milicent by the shoulders. "Millicent, you're <i>you</i>, you're real."<br/><br/>"But...who's that?"<br/><br/>"She's just a duplicate. Ignore her."<br/><br/>"But...who's real...who's the me...I'm overthinking it, aren't I?"<br/><br/>"Yes. You are in your body. You are human."<br/><br/>"I don't think I am. But I understand what you mean."<br/><br/>"You have to save your mom. Stay strong."<br/><br/><i>[Reassurance spend by Geronimo, refreshed 2 points of Stability for Millicent.]</i><br/><br/>"Let's do this," muttered Jimmy. "The world may need to stay saved on its own after this, but let's do it."<br/><br/><i>[JP Challenged Jimmy's "The world won't stay saved" Statement.]</i><br/><br/>"Amazing," said Dr. Orange. "I'd like to learn more. But let's destroy it."<br/><br/><i>[And Dr. Orange Challenges his "My Research Takes Priority" Statement.]</i><br/><br/>"Something's moving out there," said Geronimo, gazing into the murky darkness surrounding them. "We're not going to be alone for long."<br/><br/>"We need to bring our Yucatan friend here," said Jimmy. He spent a long moment concentrating. He felt his mind reach out to the others, to Ruby and DoctorOrangeMillicent...<br/><br/><i>Weeee aaarrreeeee heeerreeeee</i><br/><br/>The sound came from all their mouths in sequence. Geronimo involuntarily stumbled back. The four of them were locked into some eerie synchronicity, their mouths and hands working together as if moved by the same inhuman will, their very <i>breathing</i> now forced into an alien rhythm.<br/><br/>The sword was in his hand. He couldn't remember drawing it. Something colossal moved towards him, roughly bipedal. As it stepped into the ruby light shed by the gigantic heart, he saw that it was covered in Mouths, every inch a gaping orifice of teeth and forking tongues, oozing Nectar. What little he could see of its body seemed to be made of stone.<br/><br/>He chanted something in Latin and sprang toward it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452506/#Comment_452506" name="Item_298" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-22T16:19:54+00:00" title="April 22, 2016  4:19PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XV: Heart of Darkness Alibi (Part 10)</b><br/><br/>Jimmy, his eyes wide and pupils constricted, drew his knife and stabbed the duplicate Millicent in the chest. Blood spurted from the wound. It was absorbed, somehow, into the stony ground, and he felt his connection to the others somehow increase in intensity.<br/><br/>There was a horrible chuckle that seemed to come from all around him. "Why Jimmy Wright, are you casting spells again?"<br/><br/>He made no reply.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>The colossal...Thing With Entirely Too Many Mouths brushed past Geronimo and began striding directly at Ruby. He rolled behind it and threw some smoke bombs toward Ruby and the others. Clouds of acrid smoke surrounded them. They didn't seem to notice.<br/><br/>He heard the heavy footfalls of the Thing change direction and begin to come closer to him. He backed away from it, and then suddenly felt something wet and elastic wrap around his ankle and drag him to the ground. Acidic secretions burned his skin and he could feel the teeth of a Mouth biting him.<br/><br/>He backhanded the Sword across the tentacle. The colossus backed away into the darkness.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>Not even sure if it was her own will, Ruby jammed the ice axe at the end of her artificial arm into the false Millicent. Her head seemed to clear, although it was full of some kind of incomprehensible realm of higher thoughts than she could consciously process.<br/><br/>"Ruby," came a purring, menacing voice from the direction of the gigantic heart. "You know that when I am gone you will never be happy again."<br/><br/>She screamed, a blood-curdling, feral yell.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>"Ruby!" cried Geronimo, hearing the scream. He raced toward the sound. A spray of sticky liquid hit him with the force of a fire hose, knocking him down, filling his nose and mouth.<br/><br/>It tasted of honey and cinnamon, belying its mossy smell. He felt warmth flow through him from his groin, spreading throughout his body. He wanted Ruby. He wanted to wrench her away from the others, rip off her clothes, and penitently adore that holy flesh in the most primal of sacraments, to merge, to become one...<br/><br/>The Sword was ice cold in his hand. He rose, shaking his head, trying to summon up the will to continue.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>Millicent took Jimmy's knife from his hands wordlessly. She slashed across her double's throat, severing the head from the neck. The body fell with a thud to the floor of the cavern, already beginning to melt into a doughy, formless substance.<br/><br/>"I'm sorry," she said tonelessly.<br/><br/>"You will regret this," boomed the voice of the Liar. She looked up dispassionately as Geronimo stumbled behind Ruby. <br/><br/>Ruby turned her head slowly toward Geronimo, eyes barely registering the giant Thing looming up behind him.<br/><br/>Geronimo reached out toward her. Ruby stretched out her artificial arm and slashed at him with her ice axe.<br/><br/><i>[RP's idea; cost Geronimo a point of Stability, but helped him avoid some of the Nectar compulsion.]</i><br/><br/>Geronimo stepped back. "Mi amor?" he muttered. Then some warrior instinct in him caused him to spin around. The Sword shed a brilliant light as he raised it up, slashing at the gigantic hand reaching for him.<br/><br/><i>[Me: A Elbereth Gilthoniel!]</i><br/><br/>His blow struck home. The Thing recoiled, then struck out with a tentacle formed by a twisting braid of tongues from its myriad Mouths. He felt himself leaving the ground, flying backward into the rock wall of the cavern. Everything grew blurry as he fought to stay conscious.<br/><br/><i>[The Thing took Geronimo into negative Health here.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>Dr. Orange's senses reeled, then somehow reached some new plateau. He could see things so <i>clearly</i>, the lines of force ringing the Heart, the pull of gravity, the subtle interplay of quantum radiation that kept its obscene presence <i>here</i>, in this universe. Sweat broke out on his brow, and a trickle of blood flowed from his nose.<br/><br/>Some tiny, insignificant part of him wondered at the toll becoming the vessel for an extradimensional alien being was taking on his body, but he dismissed that as immaterial.<br/><br/><i>[The fake-Millicent gave them a Hold of 3 to pass the initial checks of the contest vs. the Liar, but now they were in the Stability or Health spending portion of the ritual.]</i><br/><br/>"Doctor," the Liar's inhuman voice called out. "I could teach you so much still."<br/><br/>"We're past that," the insignificant part of him said, while the rest of his mind raced on.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452621/#Comment_452621" name="Item_299" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-25T14:45:42+00:00" title="April 25, 2016  2:45PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XV: Heart of Darkness Alibi (Part 11)</b><br/><br/>Geronimo staggered to his feet. He saw the Thing moving toward Jimmy. "Oye, cabr\xf3n," he shouted. "<i>Qu\xe9 te jodan!</i>"<br/><br/><i>[Intimidate spend by GP.]</i><br/><br/>The Thing stopped, its hand less than a foot from Jimmy's head. It turned toward Geronimo and rushed at him, already weaving a stiff tentacle like a spear. Geronimo tried to stumble away, but he was still clumsy from the concussion he had taken.<br/><br/>The tentacle lanced through him and impaled him against the wall.<br/><br/>He groaned, blood flowing from the wound. The tentacle withdrew and he slid down the cave wall.<br/><br/><i>Soon you will be with your brother</i>, said the Thing in a voice made of the screams and mutterings of its Mouths. <i>Soon you will be mine.</i><br/><br/>"Rodolfo...I always hoped I could find a way to trick this devil into bringing you back," muttered Geronimo. It was in a breathy whisper. It was almost like a prayer. "But now I know that can never be. Give me strength, my brother. Adios."<br/><br/>He stood up. The sword leapt into his hand from where he had dropped it on the ground. "In nomine Deo!" he shouted as he slashed at the monster.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>A tiny piece of Jimmy's soul was happy. <i>Time to let go</i>, he thought, as he felt his body riot against the control of Gol-Goroth. In his heart's erratic rhythm he found a song of peace. <i>Let the world take care of itself for a while</i>.<br/><br/>"I'm going to kill Janet," said the Liar. <br/><br/>Jimmy's eyes opened. <br/><br/>"Right now," continued the Liar. "You know I can do this."<br/><br/>"Can you afford to?" whispered Jimmy. But his soul was no longer peaceful.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>The Thing batted away Geronimo's blow, and then turned back to where the others were gathered around the enormous heart. Geronimo slid into the shadows and followed it. As he got closer to the circle of his friends, he saw that tentacles tipped with Mouths had grown out of the ground behind them. One was attached to Jimmy, sucking blood out of him.<br/><br/><i>[Stealth check by GP. He was in negative Health so a lot of Investigative spends that might have helped weren\u2019t available.]</i><br/><br/>Geronimo drew his pistol and pumped several rounds into the Thing. It spun around, sprouting tongues for tentacles, weaving them into a kind of loose net.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>Ruby's breath grew shallow. Her body was failing, but she kept focusing her will on the Liar, feeling the others help her, the connection with them stronger than it had ever been.<br/><br/>Then she felt it. The pulse of Nectar in her body. She wanted to break her concentration, to give in to the feeling, but the will of Gol-Goroth bound her, resisted her feeble attempts to regain control. In her mind, she screamed again and again.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>Geronimo staggered away from the Thing. The net smashed into the ground just behind him. He stumbled forward, trying to twist around to defend himself.<br/><br/>Suddenly his foot sank into the ground and teeth bit into it. He fell down, one foot buried to the ankle in a suddenly gaping Mouth on the ground.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452622/#Comment_452622" name="Item_300" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-25T14:52:44+00:00" title="April 25, 2016  2:52PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Folks may be interested in what I used for the "Mind Maze" sequence of oddball rooms that the Investigators encountered en route to the Liar. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw8iFfIRXgBOMlM4UzIzQWpTeTA/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">So here it is</a>!<br/><br/>These were designed to be printed out double-sided on postcard labels (Avery 8387--these have turned out to be really incredibly useful for making functional handouts for me; I made cards for the major NPCs and gave them to the players.) <br/><br/>How it worked was like this: I had JP draw the first room card; each room card had a different PC listed as being in it. (And yeah, I tried to make them thematically appropriate for each room.) Then the player (MP in this case) drew from the Investigator deck to see how to play the scene.<br/><br/>This more or less worked the way I wanted, and let me put some creepy scenes into the game

Now isthetime. The time you weremadefor.</i><br/><br/>Everything became clear.<br/><br/>The world was a network of forces, branching out in beautiful fractal patterns all around her. She could see the loops and whorls of <i>matter</i>, the collected thoughtentities of her friends not that such INsignificant beings couldbe her friends. They were so fragile compared to the vastness in front of her, to the will that arced between them like lightning made of sunshine. Waves of force extended from them, washing against the enormous vortex at the center of this nexus of twentythreedimensional spacetime that the little dim cores of darkness that were the regular consciousnesses of the humans around her perceived as a cavern.<br/><br/>It looked so powerful. It looked immovable and inevitable, eternal and fixed. But that was a Lie too.<br/><br/>She raised the collection of forces that a tiny, alien part of her called <i>her hand</i> and moved it <i>thus</i>, disrupting a narrow thread of light. Something wavered. A flaw in the vortex appeared, and she expanded it with her mind, with the mind of the Otherone, and the band of power around them began to move inward, constricting the vortex, squeezing it, destabilizing the ridiculous false construct of artificial spacetime around them.<br/><br/>The walls of the cavern began to shake. Great boulders dropped from the roof. Blood and Nectar spurted from the heart.<br/><br/><i>It has begunnn</i> said a voice that wasn't there.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>The Thing stalked toward Geronimo. It chuckled ruthlessly as the senses that served it for perception watched the Spaniard grope around for his Sword. It moved closer and closer, towering over him, leaning over him to squash the life out this insignificant <i>insect</i>...<br/><br/>Geronimo rolled over slightly, revealing the Sword clutched in his left hand. He slashed at the Thing's knee, cutting cleanly through the tremendous leg of the creature. It stumbled and began to fall on top of him. Almost quicker than thought he pulled the Sword back, clutching it both hands and bracing it against the rocky floor.<br/><br/>The colossal being crashed to the ground on top of him, the Sword tearing through it like a spear. Geronimo could feel it twitching and shaking on top of him as his breath was crushed out of his body.<br/><br/><i>[Conceal test here by GP.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>Dr. Orange's left arm was numb. He was reasonably sure his heart had stopped beating some time ago. It seemed obscurely interesting. All he knew was that somehow the power of the Liar was failing. He kept his will focused on crushing it.<br/><br/>Geronimo snaked one hand down to the pistol in his belt. He managed to somehow flip it over to face into the body of the creature, and pulled the trigger until the magazine was empty. It stopped shaking and he felt its great dead weight settle down on top of him. The blackness was all  around him.<br/><br/>He refused to give in to it.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>Jimmy regarded the Heart coldly. His mind was a furious bolt of golden energy, and he could feel his personality washing away into the stream of alien power. Blood and Nectar continued to flow from the wounded god. It was up to his ankles now.<br/><br/>A word formed in his mind. Maybe it was even his own thought. <br/><br/><i>Soon</i>.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>Ruby could feel her body shutting down, already beginning to collapse to the ground, but she hung on, resisting the Nectar, resisting the unconsciousness, pushing all her will into one last constriction of force to close the gap to seal the breach in twentythreedimensional spacetime that the Other thecontagion the onewhoLies had forged and then it gave way, collapsing, waveforms falling back to baseline with a sigh of sinerhythms and it was done and over and the Mind released ITS hold on her...<br/><br/>The Heart exploded.<br/><br/>Blood and ichor rained out of it, but in slow motion. Rainbow streaks appeared at the edges of things. Everything slowed, stopped, faded to black...<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452702/#Comment_452702" name="Item_304" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-27T16:09:39+00:00" title="April 27, 2016  4:09PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XV: Heart of Darkness Alibi (Part 13)</b><br/><br/>They were on the gambling floor of a casino, seated at one of the blackjack tables. It was late at night; the few lights that were on made little pools of radiance in the inky darkness. Chairs were turned upside down on the other tables. It was quiet and peaceful.<br/><br/>Ruby absently noted that Geronimo was lying on the floor about a hundred feet away, a tall vending machine on its side pinning him to the floor.<br/><br/>"I didn't do this," said Millicent.<br/><br/>They noticed, suddenly, that they were not alone--that in addition to Ruby, Millicent, Dr. Orange and Jimmy, they were sitting at the table with a middle-aged woman in a frowsy black dress. She lit a cigarette and blew smoke at them. Seated next to her was a short balding man, with protruding eyes and an impish grin.<br/><br/><i>[Indeed, those of them who live until the 1970s will find the actor Wallace Shawn strangely familiar.]</i><br/><br/>"My friends!" he said in a high nasal voice. "I am so happy to see you!"<br/><br/>"I didn't do this!" repeated Millicent.<br/><br/>"I know, love," said the woman in black. "I'm interfacing for GG here. Easier on us all. No one wants to go through with that again."<br/><br/>"You can see me," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Oh yes. I can see <i>all </i>of you," said the woman, pointedly looking at Millicent. "Hello, darling."<br/><br/>"This is excellent!" said the little man. "I am looking forward to our new experiences. I have never been through a shut-down before!"<br/><br/>"Shut-down?" chorused the humans. And Millicent.<br/><br/>"Certainly you knew this would be a consequence of your actions. Why else did you complete the work of Ramon Echevarr\xeda?"<br/><br/>"God damn it," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"They're lost, love," said the woman in black.<br/><br/>The little man furrowed his brow, then looked up with a twinkling expression in his eyes. "Let me explain it to the doctor. You believe thinking machines are possible, yes?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"Consider a thinking machine that is complicated enough to simulate a small portion of reality. Over time, people would build more and more complex versions of that machine."<br/><br/>"Of course."<br/><br/>"If you could build a quantum computer the size of a black hole, you could simulate the entire universe. Fractally and holographically, of course."<br/><br/><i>[Yes, I knew what I was doing way back in Episode VII. This is of course the Simulation Hypothesis.]</i><br/><br/>"This universe is...a hologram? Whatever that is?" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"By every test that I have been able to do, yes. The probability approaches one-to-one."<br/><br/>"Yeah but limits approach infinity..." said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"But the probability would be so infinitesimal!"<br/><br/>"You haven't bothered to rule it out? What's the error bar?"<br/><br/>"Why, it's...that is...that's an interesting question!"<br/><br/>"So the Buddhists are right and the world is an illusion?" said Millicent to herself.<br/><br/>"In any case," continued the little man, "by removing the Liar you have completed the...call it a ritual...that will allow the shut-down sequence to be put into the matrix. I look forward to this experience. It will be a new frontier. You of course will be erased and lost."<br/><br/>"What about Vanessa?" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"And Janet," said Jimmy. "What about her?"<br/><br/>"Oh, she's fine, love," said the woman in black. "At this very instant--because I pulled you out of the timestream--all the Mouths in the world are dried up, sealed up, closed up. Even that one in Ethiopia that was going to poison Cairo in a few weeks."<br/><br/>"What about the Last Mouth?" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Well, no, not that one, that's true."<br/><br/>"What's it for?"<br/><br/>"You'll figure that one out on your own, you're a clever girl. That's really not your job."<br/><br/>"It kind of is."<br/><br/>"Nooo," drawled the woman, "and I think <i>I</i> would know."<br/><br/>"It's definitely my job. We made this mess--"<br/><br/>"No you didn't. I really don't know why you hang around with all these tiny monkeys. I mean look at them. They barely don't have tails anymore!"<br/><br/>"This is who you were telling me about?" said Millicent to Ruby.<br/> <br/>"Yeah, we really like her," said Ruby. She waved part of her hook at the woman.<br/><br/>"So I'm in a hologram in a hologram. The world is about to end, we've got a Last Mouth, and I've got a crazy sister and no body. Did I leave anything out?" Millicent said the last part to the woman in black, quite brightly.<br/><br/>"Only your true purpose, but I'm sure you'll figure that out on your own."<br/><br/>"We need to find the Last Mouth," said Millicent to the rest of them.<br/><br/>"Does it matter, if the world is about to end?" said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"So we all fade away...I'm actually all right with that at this point," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"I was all right with it ages ago," said Jimmy.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452716/#Comment_452716" name="Item_305" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-27T18:22:16+00:00" title="April 27, 2016  6:22PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, we came really close to "Okay, the universe we knew is ending.

Ruby asked the little man.<br/><br/>"No, I would think not."<br/><br/>"It sounds like the world gets to start over, just without us," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"As long as someone causes that to happen, yes," he said.<br/><br/>"Wait, what? I thought we pulled the plug on the planet."<br/><br/>"Unfortunately you are too early in the timestream for the obvious metaphor to work." <br/><br/>The little man paused and furrowed his brow again. "Ah, I have it! You drive quad-wheeled internal combustion carts, yes?"<br/><br/>"Cars. Sure."<br/><br/>"The key is in the ignition, but the starting motor has not been...cranked? What an odd word. Cranked. Cr<i>anked.</i> CranKED." He trailed off, muttering to himself.<br/><br/>"Can we do that?" said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"Until the starting motor has been turned on, the universe will not end."<br/><br/>"Can we take...the key...out of the ignition?" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Why would you want to do that?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Why would you want to do that?" said the little man.<br/><br/>"Because we want to save existence," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Because we might not want the world to end," said Millicent. "Isn't that what we've been working for all these months?"<br/><br/>"Do you not want to save all of humanity?" demanded Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Whatever you want to do now, Jimmy's out of it," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Oh, Jimmy, you do look so fagged out, love," said the woman in black. He waved a finger at her.<br/><br/>"You have three seconds to keep that finger," she snapped, then sighed. "Oh, I understand. You always were a cheeky little monkey."<br/><br/>"That's why you liked me," said Jimmy smugly.<br/><br/>"No, I never liked you. Well loves, yes, I suppose you could all go back to your homes and wait for the end..."<br/><br/>Staring at Geronimo, Ruby said "We want to stop the end."<br/><br/>"I suppose we could send you back then. Do you want to come back?"<br/><br/>"I would like to make the world not die," repeated Ruby. Dr. Orange shrugged.<br/><br/>"If we make the world not die, does something worse not happen?" said Millicent nervously.<br/><br/>"If only we would be so lucky!" said the little man.<br/><br/>"Look, we can only solve one problem," said Ruby. "Another one might start up, but that's not our issue."<br/><br/>"Do we go back to before we destroyed the Liar?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Oh, no, I'll send you back...almost exactly when you left. I'll even make a few alterations, so that you're not marooned on the mountain. I could make a few other alterations. Would you like tails? Think how useful they would be in the lab, doctor."<br/><br/>"Hrmmm," said the German. Ruby stepped on his foot.<br/><br/>"Very well," said the woman in black, standing up. "Millicent, love, I'm sure we'll see each other again very soon." <br/>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>The first thing they noticed was that it was very cold. The second thing was that they could barely breathe. Most of them at this point noticed the blue sky above them.<br/><br/>They seemed to be buried up to their necks in snow. Ruby couldn't see Geronimo. Mount Kailash soared above them. Some men were running towards them. They wore Thibetan clothes.<br/><br/>Ruby crawled up out of the snow as hands pulled her up. She began to dig around frantically. Her prosthetic was missing again.<br/><br/>The Sherpas surrounded them. "Is there anyone else?" one barked in English.<br/><br/>"Two other men," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"We will look. Get poles!"<br/><br/>Millicent clambered up to the top of the snow. She helped the Sherpas locate Geronimo, who had been buried by a rockslide. A particularly large boulder, roughly man-shaped, had pinned him to the ground.<br/><br/>He was hurt the worst of them, but not seriously enough that he could not be moved after a few days. A British patrol met them at the Indian frontier a week later, after a long winding trip through the steep roads of the high mountain country.<br/><br/>After that their trip got much more comfortable. And so they finally came to rest in New Delhi, in a very clean military hospital.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>They never did find Satan Sherpa, you know; Millicent looked for a while but never found any indication that he came down the mountain with them.<br/><br/>I haven\u2019t bothered to check, but if you like you can take my assurance that somewhere at the very summit of Mount Kailash is the frozen, bare-bottomed arse of a certain Sherpa, pointed straight up in the air at the revolted heavens. <br/><br/>It\u2019s what I would do.<br/><br/>Or if it makes you feel better, maybe he fell off the Holy Mount, tossed by an angry god or the very rocks themselves, and his broken bones are buried beneath a rockslide in some valley no profane foot would ever tread.<br/><br/>Make up your minds, loves. Decide which fiction you want to believe. It\u2019s all you ever had, really, isn\u2019t it?

Janet finally came to see him. She was dressed nicely in a sleeveless dress. Her upper right arm was bandaged. <br/><br/>In her hands was a small jewelry box.<br/><br/>"I don't know what to say about this, Jimmy," she said. "Was this...just to make me feel better? Because I'm feeling much better. They had to do surgery to cut the stone out my arm...but I should get full use of it again."<br/><br/>"I promised you I'd get it done."<br/><br/>"Yes, you did."

Jimmy was the best man, of course, and Millicent served as maid-of-honor.<br/><br/>Dr. Orange cried throughout the ceremony. "Get off my man, bitch," he muttered in German.<br/><br/>"For God's sake, man up," said Janet, who was sitting next to him.<br/><br/>Ruby wore a dress as white as she dared. Geronimo wore a tuxedo, rather than his regimentals; the uniform of his bleeding, almost expired nation was too painful to consider.<br/><br/>In the churchyard a clump of British soldiers were throwing rice at them, led by the Sparrow. "Good, you've got this out of the way. Some things have come up," she said.<br/><br/>"I need to find my mother, my sister, and my body," said Millicent miserably.<br/><br/>"Fortunately, I'm under the Official Secrets Act and don't have to think too hard about what you just said. All of you are too, I'm afraid; anything you say about this is potentially treason against the British Empire."<br/><br/>She walked with them to the staff car the Colonel of a cavalry regiment had graciously leant Geronimo. "I still have a few contacts in what's left of Epsilon Sigma," continued the Sparrow. "They're not doing too well. Probably for the best...and Mina's wrath is pretty dreadful. I hope I never cross her. She's very scary."<br/><br/>She held out a letter to Dr. Orange. "This was addressed to a Dr. Orange of the Federal Department of Health by a certain Dr. Keaton of the Joy Grove Asylum, Savannah, Georgia."<br/><br/>Dr. Orange flipped through the letter. "Edgar Job escaped," he said. "Nobody is sure how he did it. He seemed to vanish from his cell."<br/><br/>"Probably did," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"And Doug Henslowe attacked a nurse, stole an ambulance, and has also vanished."<br/><br/>"There's one last thing," said the Sparrow. "I'm not sure if it means anything to you. According to astronomers at Greenwich Observatory, a dark cloud of interstellar dust is moving through our solar system at a rather high speed...and this the explanation for why the stars seem to be going out."<br/><br/>Nobody said anything for a long time.<br/><br/>"Is there any assistance I might render?" said the Sparrow at last.<br/><br/>"I need a new arm," said Ruby. "And a spare."<br/><br/>"Our armorers can take care of you."<br/><br/>"Is Vanessa safe?" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"We delivered her back to Los Angeles. According to our agents, she is currently staying at the New Temple of Joy in some place called 'The Valley'."<br/><br/>"We will honeymoon in Los Angeles," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"But not on the plane," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Just try and stop me!" said Ruby.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/><br/>Once again the Sparrow arranged for them to have clearance at British bases, with relief pilots to keep the <i>Brightening Dawn</i> in the air as long as possible, and refueling stops in the Azores and the Caribbean so that they could cross the Atlantic.<br/><br/>On the way, Jimmy put his ring on Janet's finger while she was awake. They tried not to notice the awkward contrast between their nervous affection and the way that Ruby and Geronimo were practically bonded at several important points on their bodies.<br/><br/>Once they were back in Los Angeles, Jimmy got in touch with the remnants of his organization. Samson Trammell had recovered from his wounds. The old Temple in Echo Park was too damaged to even consider rebuilding. So he had bought a certain old farm, out in the Valley.<br/><br/>Jimmy didn't even need to check to know that it was Echevarr\xeda's farm. According to his people, he was moving some very heavy machinery out to the new Temple.<br/><br/><i>[So, first I gave everyone 2 points of Sanity--killing the Liar was worth it.</i><br/><br/><i>Geronimo made Ruby his new Solace, since he had challenged his Statement, and because it was SO appropriate.</i><br/><br/><i>Jimmy made a Credit Rating spend to dig up the lead-in clues for the Finale.</i><br/><br/><i>And I'll have some more thoughts on this episode shortly.]</i><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452861/#Comment_452861" name="Item_311" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-02T16:44:56+00:00" title="May  2, 2016  4:44PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Finale Episodes: Interlude</b><br/><br/>I promised you some thoughts on this episode.<br/><br/>I deviated pretty far from the text. Not so much in the ultimate arc of the episode, which was basically the same (climb mountain, destroy Liar, get rug pulled out from under you) but a lot of the specifics were different.<br/><br/>I had my reasons, which I tend to think were justified. But there are a few big points here:<br/><br/>--I wanted to include some of the iconography of the Liar. From what I understand, there may have been some rights issues on Pelgrane's side about that. But that didn't have to stop me <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>--I also wanted to incorporate one of the distinctions I like to make about the Mythos entities--that there's a divide between the ones who can communicate with humans, and the ones who can't. The Liar is clearly in the first category, along with Nyarlathotep, so I can perhaps be forgiven for bringing them together in my remix.<br/><br/>This episode should have given me some warning signs that my prep was in trouble. The Climbing Mount Kailash rules are still over complicated, although to be honest I think they're still more interesting than what's actually in the text; <i>Eternal Lies</i> assumes that climbing an unclimbed Himalayan peak is not something worthy of detailing to any great degree other than some rules about making Athletics checks.<br/><br/>Now, there are reasons to just accept this--the PCs are going to climb the mountain, after all, and it's consistent with the Gumshoe philosophy of making checks easier if they're plot important. But on the whole, it was underwhelming when Lisa ran me through it.<br/><br/>I'm not saying I solved it any better, although I think I was closer to doing a better job. Had I played <i>Fellowship</i> before doing this episode, I might have made the players do the "Dangerous Journey" bit from that game, where each player proposes a problem to another player and we game out what happens. Then maybe my Moves list could have worked a bit better.<br/><br/>The Moves list was also a good idea, but I was left somewhat at sea as to how to implement them in a Gumshoe game, which is predicated on player success. I'm still working through how to make that happen when I get around to making my consolidated list of Gumshoe hacks.<br/><br/>The Mind Maze card deck, on the other hand, worked really well, especially given that I pretty much came up with the idea the night before the session. I could have maybe turned the screws up a bit more on the players, but the final Drivers before the confrontation with the Liar seemed to set the table appropriately.<br/><br/>The giant beating heart was my own invention, and I'm proud of it.<br/><br/>In the actual EL text there's a specific ritual to dismiss the Liar, but I decided to cut it out as unnecessary and just use Gol-Goroth to handle the Liar. I had made so many changes to G-G in the campaign that this made sense, especially given the "cherry" they got from visiting him. It. They. (And the cherry actually makes sense if you look at it as a way for G-G to wire their brains together long enough for It to wipe out the Liar.)<br/><br/>That said, the ritual did nothing to make me change my opinion of Contests in Gumshoe. They don't work. You have to do so much heavy lifting to make them interesting, and if you don't they're just a terrible suck on PC resources. I don't know yet what to replace them with, but there's gotta be something. (<i>Fellowship</i> may be instructive here, but I need to read it a couple of more times.)<br/><br/>Which leads us to the "pulling out the rug" bit. In EL as written...I'm not going to sugarcoat it: it's pretty railroady, and relies on the GM deliberately concealing knowledge from the players. Justin Alexander has his own ideas on how to fix that; all I can say is "How do you like my solution to the Kobiyashi Maru?" Upping the stakes to not just the destruction of Earth but of the universe itself...well, on some level it doesn't matter. On the other hand, I managed to avoid the "we're now living in an alternate timeline" result of the actual Eternal Lies text, since there was no peri-apocalypse in 1937 in our world.<br/><br/>I had to get a bunch of pieces in the frame to make this "work" (assuming it did), and I didn't know for sure how it would all come together when I started. My first ideas when I was revising the campaign were to have some kind of Hindu trinity working: Creation-Preservation-Destruction. I ended up kicking that away, and for a while played around with Kabbalism before hitting upon Valentinian Gnosticism. This at least let me do what I had wanted to do at the start, put Millicent at the center of this cosmic meltdown.<br/><br/>As for the next leg of the finale, way back in Episode VII when we did hijinks with the Xoxul time machine, I suddenly had a flash that time travel should be involved in the finale. One of the hardest storytelling challenges in science fiction! I should be able to handle it, right?<br/><br/>Well....<br/><br/>In the end, I overprepped the wrong things for the finale, worried about stuff I shouldn't have worried about, and probably managed to thoroughly confuse everyone. And in the end I only had another stupid effing contest! Fortunately, I have a very forgiving group and we combined to paper over the dramatic problems of the finale and end with a quietly moving moment that summed up the character of Jimmy Wright so perfectly that I feel honored to have been part of it.<br/><br/>I have the transcription of the last episode finished but I want to take some time to whip it into shape (and add some "Deleted Scenes"--stuff that I should have gotten in but we ran out of time.) So it may be a few days until I start the last installment. In the meantime, you can read some of the things I made to prep the finale:<br/><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw8iFfIRXgBOM3ktdW1McmVLVjg/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Time Travel Principles, Paradox, and Temporal Stability Loss</a><br/><br/>As there were 1926 and 1937 versions of the PCs in the finale, I asked them to keep one sheet but track Health, Stability, and Sanity <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw8iFfIRXgBOaUNHdmdZRDZBZzQ/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">separately on these cards</a>.<br/><br/>As one possibility for the climax would involve a mass assault, I made <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw8iFfIRXgBOaU5iUVcycVBSdTg/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">these cards for allies and enemies of the PCs</a>. They didn't end up coming into play much, but I think they look nifty, so here they are. (I based the design on similar cards I made for the last run of the Cortex Plus Drama "Ripper" game, where I gave each major NPC a rather freeform assignment of abilities plus one distinction that PCs could harvest Plot Points from.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452875/#Comment_452875" name="Item_312" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-03T06:05:44+00:00" title="May  3, 2016  6:05AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd forgotten about the cloud and the stars going out.

So much blood and murder and now, maybe, we\u2019re almost to another ending. (Happy or not I\u2019ll leave to you to decide.) But now I want to know: would they do it all over again, if they could? And if they could, what would they change? Humans are always complaining about how the gods they despise have arbitrary powers of life and death and change. (And they always despise them, <i>mon hypocrite lecteur</i>, no matter what the devotionals say.) <br/><br/>But give <i>humans </i>those powers, and the story changes, doesn\u2019t it? Then it becomes all about satisfying yourself, or at best the tragic way that you can\u2019t satisfy yourself without making everything worse. <br/><br/>Even our heroes are like that, I think. When faced with these ultimate questions, when the bill for saving the world finally comes due, what will they pay?<br/><br/>We\u2019re about to find out. But I\u2019ll tell you what Jimmy will pay.<br/><br/>Everything that makes him a hero.<br/>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Dr. Orange had taken an office in Ruby's headquarters for the Los Angeles Society for Archaeological Studies. While he and the others had been away, an enormous metal tank had been delivered to the Society and installed in the basement, although none of them knew who had ordered such a thing. Dr. Orange guessed that Jimmy was involved somehow. He couldn't have been more right, of course.<br/><br/>He had been back in L.A. for three days when the letter from Nikola Tesla arrived. <br/><br/>The thick packet, written out in a cramped nineteenth century handwriting, described a process the Serbian called "Chronophotography"; it described a certain kind of film, that needed to be loaded in a certain kind of camera, and then exposed for a 24 hour period at a location suspiciously close to Samson Trammel's new Temple of Joy. The last part of the letter detailed how to develop the film using emulsions to raise thin layers of chemicals from the film.<br/><br/>Dr. Orange was beyond--well beyond--the necessity of trying to understand the unusual things that happened to him; he grabbed a couple of grad students at Caltech and set up the camera at the spot Tesla indicated.<br/><br/><i>[1 point Chemistry spend to pull this off.]</i><br/><br/>When he saw the film, he was disappointed that it seemed to be solid black and overexposed. Nonetheless, he tried following the instructions and soon discovered the film was black because it contained hundreds of images superimposed on each other. As he struck prints off of the results, he discovered that it seemed to depict the same scene, over and over again, each image different to a greater or lesser degree from the rest.<br/><br/>Based on the angle of the shadows, the images seemed to be slightly in the future. And each showed him and Ruby, Jimmy, and Geronimo attacking the Temple of Joy and being cut down in various gruesome ways.<br/><br/>He took the results to Jimmy. "I got this information from Nikola Tesla. Does that sound plausible?"<br/><br/>Jimmy twitched. "I met him once. But he wasn't really Tesla."<br/><br/>"Good response. The results seem to show that Trammel is expecting us. That wouldn't be good. Strategy isn't my department, I just develop the crazy photographs...and there's more. Based on what Job was working on, this looks like the successive iterations of a time loop of some kind."<br/><br/>"We need to get plans for Trammel's place," said Jimmy, ignoring that last part.<br/><br/>"Already done. At least, here's the plans he filed with the city. As for the rest, well, Tesla said he's coming to L.A."<br/><br/><i>[Bureaucracy spend by the Doc.]</i><br/><br/>"Let's make lunch plans."<br/>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Jimmy, Dr. Orange, and Millicent met Tesla at Musso and Frank's, which seemed an appropriate place to have a kaffeeklatsch about the end of the world. Also, the brisket; have you tasted it there? Tesla greeted them warmly. "Dr. Orange, a pleasure to meet you. Still thinking spacetime is curved? I'm very happy to see you. As I am to see you," he said, looking sharply at Jimmy, "<i>old friend</i>."<br/><br/><i>Called it</i>, thought Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Allow me to explain," said Tesla. "The person you know as Nikola Tesla is a complicated multidimensional entity. Oh, he was born a human in Serbia many years ago, as you can see\u2014this body is kind of falling apart here. But Tesla was a very strange human being. The Great Race of Yith is generally able to swap consciousnesses with human beings, sending the human mind into the Yithian receptacle. But for a very small number of humans, it is possible for a Yithian mind to <i>coexist</i> with the human mind in the same body. This is what our Renegade did. He was my job to catch, which is how I met Jimmy all those years ago."<br/><br/>"So the body you're using is the body you were sent to catch?" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"You never caught him?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"He went through the portal, remember? The point I'm trying to make is that I was going to return home to the Yithian consciousness."<br/><br/>The others stared blankly. <br/><br/>"Right. Let me explain. Yithians can project their minds forward in time. Obviously, this will change time when it happens. So we branch. There are separate iterations of our 'selves' that exist throughout the timestream. Periodically, we merge them back together. There is a Yithian group consciousness. Not a hive mind, but something we all share; this is how we can look at time and say, 'this can never be, this is all right to change, and this must happen.'"<br/><br/>"So Yithians are fifth dimensional beings is what you're saying," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>Tesla chortled. "Oh, you're so cute! It's like watching a kitten play with a string! <i>Five</i> dimensions...to continue, in late 1926 I planned to return to the Yithian consciousness only to discover that we all were trapped inside a time loop between 1926 and 1937. We are approaching the period where the loop will turn and we will return to 1926...not that any of you will remember."<br/><br/>"Is this like running a simulation, like they were telling us, over and over?" asked Millicent.<br/><br/>"No...well...maybe. We don't know. We understand the simulation hypothesis. Some of us believe it enough that we have begun making a world outside of time that we can live in. You'll be pleased to know that we're using human as the baseline for the form we will take on that planet."<br/><br/>"Really?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Yes. We're going to add some improvements. Some...redundancy in the major organs, I think."<br/><br/><i>[Perhaps I should have had Tesla wear a long striped scarf...]</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453100/#Comment_453100" name="Item_315" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-09T15:02:59+00:00" title="May  9, 2016  3:02PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2016 3:04PM by Aviatrix.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XVI: Ashes to Ashes (Part 2)</b><br/><br/>"So we have the time loop, and outside the time loop, and outside the world," began Millicent.<br/><br/>"We say loop. It's more like a vortex. It keeps coming back and back and back..."<br/><br/>"So like when you flush a toilet."<br/><br/>"...yes. Later events can affect prior events...but prior events have an inertia that draws them into the vortex. If you went back to say 1519--I'll get to that--you'd have no way of avoiding being drawn into the time loop even if you tried to jump past it. The only way to stop the loop is to go to 1926 and <i>stop it</i>."<br/><br/>"But we can't travel in time," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"I'll get to that too. But first I think we need to consult with my colleague. The Prime consciousness."<br/><br/>Everyone stared blankly again.<br/><br/>"Right, I left you behind again. Sorry."<br/><br/>"You've got multiple yous," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Precisely. But more importantly, there is one version of Kakakatak that was placed in a very special body we constructed back in the Pliocene. Because we knew that someone was going to try and pull a Yithian out of time. We made a trap body, a body advanced enough that its consciousness is preserved through the time loop. Unlike Tesla's body; every time I go through the loop, I have to be updated by the Prime."<br/><br/>"This is why the pantsuit was so important," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Yes. Wait a minute...Ruby wasn't wearing a dress? Is your insurance paid up? Asking for a friend."<br/><br/>"Well, I don't have a company anymore, so no," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Ah. Because of the pantsuit...well...yes, but not exactly...imagine a butterfly..."<br/><br/>"Mr. Wright, was this something I did?" asked Millicent while Tesla tried to draw a butterfly in the amazon and an earthquake in Crete on his napkin.<br/><br/>"It's what we all did," said Dr. Orange, "all of us in this loop. But if we go forward to the past, we can fix it."<br/><br/>Tesla, disappointed nobody was paying attention to the diorama he was constructing with a pair of peppermills, looked at Dr. Orange. "You do know where a time machine is, of course."<br/><br/>"The pyramid in the Yucatan," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"Yithians understand time machine technology, but we don't use them."<br/><br/>"You don't seem to need them."<br/><br/>"That's not the reason though. A time machine is a paradox generator; if you use them, you will create a paradox. There's a much lesser chance when you use <i>psychic</i> time travel; the seventeen dimensional math works out much better. As it turns out, it is possible to send you outside the loop because of a curious twist of fate: in 1519, you used a time machine to visit Gol-Goroth...a completely tactless entity, we don't like to talk to it."<br/><br/>"And?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"You don't think your <i>physical</i> bodies travelled into another dimension? Your <i>minds</i> did. When you returned, well, constructing a new, identical body for you was trivial for that entity...except for Millicent. She's...strange. So he just asked you to reconstruct yourself, my dear, out of your own consciousness. Your original bodies are in 1519, without minds."<br/><br/>"We have other bodies there?" said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"Precisely. Eventually your bodies will die, but you'll still be here."<br/><br/>"So...could we return to them? Psychically?"<br/><br/>"Precisely, doctor! And then take the time machine to 1926!"<br/><br/>"Can you return us to the same timestream if we use the machine?"<br/><br/>"If you can get to the singularity, we can attack it from both sides. I will use Yithian techniques to branch your consciousness; you will be in 1926 and 1937 simultaneously. Of course, we don't know what the Echevarr\xeda ritual was precisely; I suggest you investigate this in the past."<br/><br/>"So what happens if we close the loop to our bodies in 1937?" said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"There will be some...sorting out. Look, I'm not saying we're not going to get our hair mussed on this one."<br/><br/>"Will we <i>know</i>?"<br/><br/>"Yes! Probably."<br/><br/>"That's not good then. I'd rather pretend that I'm me."<br/><br/>"So we'll retain memories of all this?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"You're time travelers, so yes...I could help you sort it out. As for me, I'll return to the Yithian consciousness, so this branch of Kakakatak will probably be erased."<br/><br/>"What are we supposed to do in 1926?" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"<i>Something</i> must change," said Tesla.

It took a long time to track it down in the Australian Outback."<br/><br/>"I have a question," said Dr. Orange. "What happens if you go back in time and kill your own grandfather before your father was born? Then your father never existed, so you can't exist, but then how did you kill..."<br/><br/>"Yeah, don't do that," said Kakakatak. "Seriously, what kind of a person would you do that? If you do that, my people will fix it...and you won't like it when we fix it."<br/><br/>"I get it!" said Millicent. "Time's a spiral!" She drew a corkscrewing line on her napkin. "Here's us in 1937. There's our bodies in 1519. And here's where we'll be in 1926. It's like we'll be on three different floors of a building with one of those long spiral staircases."<br/><br/>"Yes," said Kakakatak. "Like the Guggenheim Museum in New...wait. Sorry, spoilers."<br/><br/>"You already spoiled me about Florida," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"You got the postcard?

Pack your gear."<br/><br/>"James?"<br/><br/>"I'll be there in about two hours." The phone went dead.<br/><br/>"Geronimo," said Ruby, when she got back to the bedroom, "We go to war."<br/><br/>He put out his cigarette. "What?"<br/><br/>"We'll be doing some time traveling."<br/><br/>"What!"<br/><br/>"Is that really any less normal than what we've been doing? Bring your sword."<br/><br/>"We finally had some peace," grumbled Geronimo. "Some normalcy."<br/><br/>"We've done nothing normal," said Ruby with bedroom eyes.<br/>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>They all finally met up at the old Spanish-style building that housed LSAS's headquarters. Ruby heard banging noises from the basement and looked at Jimmy.<br/><br/>"It's all right," he said. "It's an old friend."<br/><br/>They went down into the basement, not without some trepidation. The huge iron canister that had been installed in one corner was shaking violently. Something was pounding the hell out of it--from the inside.<br/><br/>Rivets popped. The seams began to split. Steam and cold air puffed out. Then the canister split down the side as the final blow ripped it apart with an earsplitting bang.<br/><br/>Salty water poured across the basement. A cloud of condensation, cold, clammy, drifted over them. And Something came out of the ruined shell.<br/><br/>It was tall, perhaps ten feet tall. Most of it was a conical body, broad at the base and tapering to a height of about eight feet. It was covered in wrinkled skin, with feathers or quills ruffling along its sides. Two long tentacles sprouted from the apex of the cone; they writhed in the air menacingly, the large lobster-like claws at their tips clacking harshly. From the tip of the apex rose a long stalk, slender and flexible, and at the top of the stalk was a balloon-like head of some sort. A mass of slender worm-like flagellae wriggled beneath three goggling eyes, and flower-like growths waved back and forth even though there was no breeze. A third tentacle attached to the apex behind the stalk, and at the end of it was a cluster of four bell shaped growths that looked like trumpet mouths.<br/><br/>The third tentacle raised in the air, and Kakakatak spoke.<br/><br/>Its voice was astonishingly beautiful, filled with overharmonies and suspended tones, like a chorus backed with a woodwind orchestra. "Greetings," it said.<br/><br/>"I really did sound horrible," said Jimmy, remembering the time he had briefly inhabited the Yithian's body.<br/><br/>"Yes. You sounded like a rake on a chalkboard," came the mellifluous response.<br/><br/>"I'm not a savant."<br/><br/>"I am Kakakatak," said the Yithian. <br/><br/>"We guessed," said Dr. Orange, clearly shaken.<br/><br/>If a Yithian could shrug, Kakakatak would have. "I never get to make the entrance I want," it said.<br/><br/><i>[4 point Stability loss for everyone here.]</i><br/><br/>"Jimmy," said Geronimo, hand reaching inside his coat for his pistol, "is this thing dangerous?" He eyed the enormous claws nervously.<br/><br/>"Absolutely. But he's as much of a friend as something like that can be."<br/>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Kakakatak helped build or finish building several pieces of equipment. Dr. Orange was curious how he managed to do that with such clumsy claws.<br/><br/>"I use my head tentacles," said the Yitihian, using his head tentacles to solder a circuitboard.<br/><br/>"Can you make a charger for my lightning gun?" asked Jimmy.<br/><br/>"They run on alternating current. Just plug it into the wall; if you don't have the cable, you can get one at the hardware store."<br/><br/>"You never...just plugged in in?" said Geronimo.<br/><br/>Jimmy shook his head. "I need a drink," he said.<br/><br/>The main piece of equipment Kakakatak worked on was a strange device, a headdress of some kind, a complicated affair of lenses and mirrors--a Yithian mind-exchange device, it explained.<br/><br/>"You just happened to have one?" said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>Jimmy shrugged. "Been doing this a long time."<br/><br/>"Geronimo," said Kakakatak, "this transition will be harder for you, since you did not make the trip to 1519. But fortunately there was another man who did; the others found him in the pyramid. I should warn you...there will be a period of adjustment."<br/><br/>"What was he like?" asked Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Well," began Ruby, "he was Mexican..."<br/><br/>Geronimo grimaced. "Will I have my weapons?"<br/><br/>"Of course not," said Kakakatak. "I'm only sending your mind back. You people want everything! Anyone else personally arrive on Earth during the Mesozoic? Yeah, didn't <i>think</i> so."<br/><br/>After about twenty hours of nonstop work, the Yithian was finished with his preparations. "You can make the trip to 1519 as soon as you are ready," it told them.<br/><br/>"I will literally never be ready," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>The device that the Yithian and Tesla had built--they were superbly well coordinated--was a large complex of arcing electrodes, humming transformers, and clacking relays. Five chairs were mounted in the midst of all this equipment. A Tesla coil sparked somewhere behind the chairs.<br/><br/>They had barely sat down when Tesla threw a switch and they were somewhere else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453148/#Comment_453148" name="Item_317" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-10T14:35:20+00:00" title="May 10, 2016  2:35PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XVI: Ashes to Ashes (Part 4)</b><br/><br/>Ruby gradually came back to her senses. Everything hurt. Her tongue was thick with thirst. The air was muggy and humid, and she could hear strange bird cries coming from the forest she could see in her peripheral vision.<br/><br/>She and the others were suspended from a wooden pole. Behind her she could hear people speaking a language she supposed was Xoxul. Her wrists ached horribly from ropes binding them to the pole...<br/><br/><i>Wrists</i>. <br/><br/>She stifled a sob. A very bedraggled man wearing a rusty steel cuirass leaned into her field of view. "Ah, you're waking up!" he said in Spanish. His accent was strange, definitely European Spanish, but not one she was familiar with.<br/><br/>"The queen wanted to talk to you," the Spaniard said. "But you pulled that lever and all passed out."<br/><br/>"Ask him how long we've been out," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"A day or so," said the Spaniard after Ruby relayed the question. "We will talk to her now," she added.<br/><br/>"Yes, I think so."<br/><br/>"Please let us down gently."<br/><br/>"That's not really up to me," said the Spaniard nervously. "It's up to the men with the wooden clubs..."<br/><br/>"Can you speak their language?"<br/><br/>"Yes?"<br/><br/>"Can you speak English?" asked Jimmy.<br/><br/>"<i>Que?</i>"<br/><br/>Some Xoxul cut their ropes with obsidian knives and they collapsed onto the stone flags of the massive courtyard of Chichen Xoxul. They all got up slowly. Millicent recovered first and made her way to the Spaniard.<br/><br/>"Are you Senor Francisco Belacazar?" she asked.<br/><br/>"Si, Don Belacazar at your service."<br/><br/>"He's the ancestor of Francisco de la Vega," said Millicent to Ruby.<br/><br/>"Hey, we could nip this in the bud," said Ruby. "Kakakatak never said we couldn't mess with events that have already happened to us..."<br/><br/>"Don't mess with the timestream," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Then why are we here?"<br/><br/>"We are here to deal with the singularity. We need to stop the first ritual. This is a pit stop."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>"This is Queen Estrella de Tardes," said Belacazar. They had been brought to one end of the courtyard, near the complex of pillars they had wandered through long ago. Or...long from now.<br/><br/>The queen was a haughty young woman in a feathered cloak, with beautiful jade and obsidian jewelry. It was clear to Millicent and Ruby that she had some Spanish ancestry, a suspicion that was reinforced when the queen began to speak to them in Spanish. Millicent noted that her Spanish was the same as the Yucatanero Spanish they had heard back in the 20th Century.<br/><br/>(Oh my, keeping track of tenses is going to be a <i>thing</i>, isn't it?)<br/><br/>"We apologize for inconveniencing you," said Geronimo in Spanish.<br/><br/>"You mean how you appeared out of thin air in our most holy place?"<br/><br/>"Tell her that maybe we're gods," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"Maybe," said the queen. "Perhaps they sent you as a special sacrifice."<br/><br/>"Stupid human sacrifice culture," muttered Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"Were you called M\xe9rida once?" asked Millicent.<br/><br/>"No. Why does that word sound familiar?"<br/><br/>"I am from there, my queen," said Belacazar.<br/><br/>"We are here because we are here to save your future," said Geronimo.<br/><br/><i>[Reassurance spend here by GP to avoid being sacrificed.]</i><br/><br/>"You talk just like my mother."<br/><br/>"Was your mother M\xe9rida?" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Her name was Morning Star. She appeared in the forest one day and married our king."<br/><br/>"Did she teach you Spanish?"<br/><br/>"Yes, so that I would know the language of the invaders. She spoke it properly, not like Belacazar who is a peasant and doesn't know his own language."`<br/><br/>Geronimo shook his head. "We have been brought like your mother was," he said.<br/><br/>"You didn't appear in the forest."<br/><br/>"We are from your future."<br/><br/>"That doesn't make any sense."<br/><br/>"It does. It is what happened to your mother. She was from the future."<br/><br/>"No, she was from the gods."<br/><br/>"Yes. They sent her from the future."<br/><br/>"How can there be a future? If we don't make the sacrifices, the sun won't rise. I mean...come on, people."<br/><br/>"The sacrifices never end. Your line extends very far into the future," said Ruby. "And because of your loyal sacrifices, the gods have sent us to ensure your line continues."<br/><br/><i>[Flattery spend by Ruby.]</i><br/><br/>"I don't know what you are yet," said the queen. "I must pray. In the meantime, you may walk about the city. Don't do anything stupid. We'll kill you. If you have questions, ask the pale one.

Morning Star had not been Xoxul. She was a sad, light-skinned woman who seemed to be mourning some great wrong. But whenever anyone asked if she was happy, she would tell them that she was, adding "I came here on purpose."<br/><br/>"Did she ever say why she came back?" asked Millicent.<br/><br/>"She would only have told such a thing to the queen her daughter."<br/><br/>Jimmy wandered out into the forest, followed by his minders, two large Xoxul warriors. Large for Xoxul; he towered over them. On the other hand, a war club is a great equalizer.<br/><br/>He wandered over to the cenote, which quite notably did <i>not </i>look like a Mouth. He thought about trying to climb down, but his minders indicated graphically that this would be a bad idea.<br/><br/>He walked back toward the plaza, his hands in his pockets. Suddenly he stopped dead.<br/><br/>"My rabbit's foot!" he said, pulling it out of his pocket. "I still have it!"<br/><br/>In celebration, he had Belacazar ask his minders to show him some Xoxul wrestling techniques, which they gladly did. With gusto. This expanded into demonstration of weapons techniques, including how to hamstring a running man with an obsidian-lined great club. It was a very hands-on demonstration; they used a couple of slaves to prove the efficacy of their methods. One invited Jimmy to give it a try.<br/><br/>He shrugged and went ahead. He wasn't the man he used to be, anymore.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Millicent sat quietly near the queen's pavilion, watching her pray to the gods. Eventually two of the queen's servants brought her in front of the queen. Millicent made a clumsy greeting in Xoxul, which she was picking up rapidly.<br/><br/>"Did your mother explain her purposes to you?" she asked the queen. "She was supposed to have a reason to come back here."<br/><br/>"You remind me of her," said the queen. "I don't know why. You don't look like her at all. But there's something about you that's similar."<br/><br/>"I don't think I ever met her."<br/><br/>"She told me once she was the daughter of a god. I don't know what she meant."<br/><br/>"I was told gods have children but not the way mortals have children."<br/><br/>"That would seem to make sense."<br/><br/>"A shamaness told me about this, and that there were things about my parents I didn't know...then she was killed."<br/><br/>"How unfortunate. My mother came here because of a fight with her husband...or brother, I'm not sure. She said that they were going to perform a ritual that was written on golden plates, but it sank in a great metal canoe."<br/><br/>"I have heard something about this. Many have searched for the gold that was on that ship, but it was never found. Perhaps we are here to learn what you just said, and then retrieve those plates and send them to the gods."<br/><br/>"Perhaps. She did not tell me. Then one day she walked into the forest and disappeared."<br/><br/><i>[Two point Intimidation spend by MP, since she lacked Reassurance; however, Millicent was creepy enough that the queen actually opened up to her.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Ruby walked with...<br/><br/>Well, not Geronimo, obviously. Geronimo had never traveled to 1519. Geronimo had been transported by Kakakatak into the body of Vasquez, one of Brooks' men. He had been trapped in the pyramid and made the trip with them into the past.<br/><br/>He was still getting the feel for his limbs.<br/><br/><i>[GP lost 1d6 points that had to be spread out over Weapons, Athletics, or Health to simulate the temporary disorientation.]</i><br/><br/>He and Ruby were strolling by the edge of the forest. Behind them the great pyramid loomed, conveniently blocking the view from the plaza.<br/><br/>"Ruby...my love," he said, caressing her face.<br/><br/>Ruby made a moue.<br/><br/>"It's the same mind!" said Geronimo sharply. "Or do you just love me for my body?"<br/><br/>"No...how do you feel?"<br/><br/>"A little strange. But everything still works. Perhaps you could dream us together, if this is uncomfortable."<br/><br/>"I can enter dreams, but do you think it's a good idea here, this close to a holy site where they do human sacrifice?"<br/><br/>"Don't you think that it will prove that we are not here to be sacrificed, but as a sign of fertility?"<br/><br/>"Uh..."<br/><br/><i>[We paused here to discuss the various ways they could get the plates, get back to 1926, and assorted other time travel conundrums.

The city was deserted, the jungle silent. The great pyramid loomed against a twilit sky.<br/><br/>In the plaza, she found Belacazar, wearing shining armor. He was surprised to see her. "You know how to do this too?" they said to each other at the same time.<br/><br/>"The queen showed me how to do this," said the conquistador. "I will never return to Spain, but in my dreams I can go there and walk the streets of M\xe9rida. Sometimes it looks very different. Are there flying birds of metal where you are from?"<br/><br/>"I used to own one. It was beautiful, a beautiful machine."<br/><br/>"They seem to be loud and noisy and smell bad."<br/><br/>"Not on the inside."<br/><br/>"If I'm ever eaten by a large metal bird I'll keep that in mind. When did you learn how to speak Castilian?"<br/><br/>"My husband taught me."<br/><br/>"Hrm, well he doesn't seem like a hidalgo...but wait, when you thought of your husband just then, he looked like someone else. Are you unfaithful? And if so, why not with me?"<br/><br/>"No...what we have been through is even more complicated than what we are doing."<br/><br/>"Very well. What are you here to do now? Perhaps I can help. I can take you on a tour of M\xe9rida, best place to get sopa ajo, so good..."<br/><br/>"How far forward or back can you see?"<br/><br/>"I don't know how to control it. The queen only taught me a few tricks."<br/><br/>Ruby tried to concentrate on Queen Morning Star...M\xe9rida Echevarr\xeda...but she ran headlong into a wall of spacetime.<br/><br/><i>[3 point Stability loss.]</i><br/><br/>She swung her attention to Queen Evening Star. She found her meditating on top of the pyramid.<br/><br/>"Who are you? Only gods and demons come to me in dreams. Which one are you?"<br/><br/>Ruby unfolded two visions of the future: one where the Queen helped the visitors from the future, and one where they didn't. She made sure the second one was horrific.<br/><br/>"Well," said the Queen, finally. "We were going to have a quintuple sacrifice in the morning. But all right. We will help you." She woke up, and vanished.<br/><br/>Ruby stood alone on top of the pyramid. "Belacazar could visit the future...and Millicent walked out of the dreamtime...maybe it is possible to visit 1911 that way..."<br/><br/>She waited until her friends were asleep. Fortunately that was in dream time, so it took not a moment. \n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>As for the others, the Xoxul had graciously provided soporific drugs for everyone, just in case the sacrifice was still on in the morning. As they drifted through sleep, they seemed to be moving through a fluffy white cloud, toward the sound of music.<br/><br/>Gradually they became aware of their surroundings. They were seated at the bar of what looked like the saloon of a steamship. A band was playing gentle waltzes quietly at one end of the room. They were wearing evening clothes: dinner jackets for the men, and a dress with a narrow skirt and a bustle for ruby. She had trouble catching her breath; she was wearing a corset.<br/><br/>"Would you like another drink, madam?" said the bartender. She looked at him. He looked exactly like Charlie, except for the missing tattoos.<br/><br/>"Thank you," she squeaked.<br/><br/>"Very good, Miss Ruby."<br/><br/>"Jimmy, Dr. Orange," whispered Ruby, "you are our resident getting in trouble people. You go investigate the various rooms. Geronimo and Millicent will case the place. Then you can go find trouble."<br/><br/>"Why should I go looking for trouble?" said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Because you're Jimmy Wright."<br/><br/>"I don't look for trouble, trouble finds me."<br/><br/>"Then we'll help it along."<br/><br/>Ruby turned back to Charlie. "Have you seen the Echevarr\xedas? We have an appointment with them."<br/><br/>"Ram\xf3n and M\xe9rida? They're on the ship. They fight a lot. You can find them in First Class."<br/><br/>"Shall we?" said Ruby to Geronimo. He took her arm and they went off in search of a purser.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>"What," said the First Class purser. "Terrible, second class people coming up here..."<br/><br/>"I would like for you to hold on to my necklace, if you may," said Ruby, beaming and fingering the enormous diamonds suspended from her neck.<br/><br/>"Fine. I don't know why you didn't store them when you boarded, or why you're taking it off before dinner..."

After a few whispered words to the ma\xeetre d' about how much they <i>enjoyed</i> the food and had met the most <i>charming </i>couple the other night and couldn't he just seat them over there with them, she so liked the way people treated them on the ship...they found themselves seated at the same table as the Echevarr\xedas.<br/><br/><i>[Flattery spend by RP.]</i><br/><br/>Ram\xf3n was easy to recognize from the several photographs they had seen of him: a dark Latino man, with a formidable charisma and a strange aura of power. The woman...<br/><br/>They recognized her features. They had seen them in pictures of a poor singer who had become a monster in Mexico City, in the cheekbones of Xoxul queen, and in the portrait a lovesick hidalgo had hanging in his sitting room.<br/><br/>She had black hair and black eyes. There was an air of indefinable sadness hanging around her, despite the fact they were both having a very loud and angry discussion.<br/><br/>"Your plan is insane!" she said. "You should--"<br/><br/>"No, No! But you don't understand! We <i>must</i> do this, in order to achieve what we have hoped for so long...pardon me, senor. Darling, there are some other guests. We will discuss this later."<br/><br/>Ram\xf3n stood up and kissed Ruby's hand, then bowed to Geronimo. "I am Ram\xf3n Echevarr\xeda. This is my wife. At your service, se\xf1or." They all sat down.<br/><br/>"I am Geronimo Cuevas. This is my wife, Ruby Fitzgibbons."<br/><br/>"<i>Enchante, madame</i>. I detect a Spanish accent, se\xf1or?"<br/><br/>"Yes, I am from Aragon."<br/><br/>"I recently returned from Spain."<br/><br/>"I have not seen it for many years. I have been spending my time in the Americas."<br/><br/>"What is your line of work? I can tell you are a man of business, not a gentleman of leisure."<br/><br/>"I am a jewel merchant," said Geronimo casually.<br/><br/>"Fascinating trade. My family grows sisal. It is a remarkable source of wealth. You are traveling to New York?"<br/><br/>"Yes. We were celebrating our honeymoon."<br/><br/>"Congratulations, se\xf1or. Madam, you have a remarkably attentive and attractive husband."<br/><br/>M\xe9rida shot her a look like daggers.<br/><br/>"May I beg you the pleasure of a dance?" said Ram\xf3n to Ruby.<br/><br/>"Of course," she said smoothly.<br/><br/>"And may I ask se\xf1ora Echevarr\xeda for a dance?" said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Con permiso," said Ram\xf3n.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>It took a few minutes, but Millicent was able to force the lock into the storage room. Most of what she saw was routine items--mail, supplies for the crew, that sort of thing. In the back however, she found a large safe.<br/><br/>She spread out her tools and went to work.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Jimmy found the purser and tried to bribe him to find Ram\xf3n's stateroom. Fortunately he remembered that his money--either because of magic, or an overly literal mind--would be suspiciously out of date.<br/><br/>He tried offering his watch.<br/><br/>"Who wants to wear a watch on their wrist?" said the purser with a snort. "It's too big to give to my wife."<br/><br/><i>[Wristwatches for men didn't become fashionable until WWI.]</i><br/><br/>"How about these cufflinks?"<br/><br/>"Hrm...all right, I can take you there and forget that I did. Of course, if you're discovered, I'm going to rat you out."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Ram\xf3n Echevarr\xeda was, unsurprisingly, an excellent dancer. He led Ruby expertly through a slow Viennese waltz. She chatted him up about her travels around the world.<br/><br/>"Have you ever been to Siam? It's to <i>die</i> for."<br/><br/>"I have never been. But I have long wished to go there," said Ram\xf3n. "I have recently returned from Ethiopia."<br/><br/>"So many beautiful things there as well. In Siam, we heard that there was a place where men kept tigers as pets."<br/><br/>"That seems a foolish extravagance."<br/><br/>"I agree."<br/><br/>"A true man of power would not need to make such displays. The polite thing, if he were a man of culture as well as power, would be to not display it at all. You would not be aware of his power."<br/><br/>Not far behind them, Geronimo danced with M\xe9rida. "What do you think you are doing?" she hissed at him. "My husband will of course know who you are."<br/><br/>"What do you mean?"<br/><br/>"You did not board this ship in Havana, did you? Whatever it is you intend, be careful. My husband is a jealous and violent man."<br/><br/>"Why do you continue to be with this man, who treats you so? You deserve a lot more respect."<br/><br/>"I do not in fact know myself sometimes. But we share a bond that is particularly strong."<br/><br/>"I guess you know your own heart...but you should treated with more--"<br/><br/>"You did not come alone. I don't mean your wife. I should have sensed this sooner. Whatever you're doing, I suggest you get out of here very soon."<br/><br/>"But we are enjoying this dance so."<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453201/#Comment_453201" name="Item_321" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-11T15:57:22+00:00" title="May 11, 2016  3:57PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XVI: Ashes to Ashes (Part 8)</b><br/><br/>Most of the Echevarr\xeda's stateroom was taken up by their clothes, of course; Ram\xf3n was vain, and he dressed M\xe9rida in a manner befitting his magnificence. But then Jimmy found the books.<br/><br/>"Again with the books," he said, showing them to Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"Jimmy...I think those books were some of the ones we found in Trammel's place, back in 1937. Maybe we should..."<br/><br/>"Keep them? and change history? Don't fuck with the timeline."<br/><br/>"Don't forget, the ship is going to sink. Maybe we're the ones who rescue them."<br/><br/>He recognized some of the books. He had <i>read</i> some others. But the ones that were written in Coptic, that were clearly of Ethiopian origin, those intrigued him. But not as much as Ram\xf3n's diaries.<br/><br/>"Hey doc, do you speak Spanish?" he asked.<br/><br/>"I'm going to let you read that. I don't want the book bound in human skin."<br/><br/>Jimmy sighed, and borrowed Spanish from Millicent. Most of the book was about Echevarr\xeda's travels, or Chichen Xoxul, which he had visited many, many times (after all, it was in his backyard.) There were also many pages describing the Liar, and how to summon It, and the Mouths, and what you could with Nectar.<br/><br/>And of course notes on the First Mouth.<br/><br/>Jimmy found himself reading on despite himself. He found himself fascinated by Ram\xf3n's damaged character, his desperate pride, his moments of grave self-doubt, the private triumphs that he could never share with other people. <i>I know this guy</i>, he thought, without irony or self-awareness. <i>And I can use that to fight him</i>.<br/><br/><i>[I gave JP a 3-point "Fighting Ram\xf3n" pool in exchange for a 1-point Evidence Collection spend.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Millicent gave the dial a final spin and pulled open the safe door. Inside she found a great deal of money in both gold and paper currency, some very elegant jewelry, and several large tablets made of gold, covered with Mayan style hieroglyphs. She found a suitcase left by a passenger in the storage room, emptied it, and dropped the tablets inside. She dragged the suitcase out into the companionway and closed the door behind her. Then she walked toward the saloon, lugging the suitcase with it.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>The music ended and the couples made their way back to the table. Ram\xf3n tried to say something to Ruby, but M\xe9rida angrily cut him off. "I don't want you talking to that girl anymore!"<br/><br/>"Let's discuss this outside," snarled Ram\xf3n, seizing her by the arm and dragging her through a pair of double doors and out onto the deck.<br/><br/>Ruby and Geronimo went back to the saloon. They could see the Echevarr\xeda's still arguing outside as a fog bank rolled in. Ram\xf3n seemed to be alternatively demanding and pleading. At one point he said something to M\xe9rida that caused her to recoil and push him back from her. <br/><br/>She took a handkerchief from her reticule and held it aloft.<br/><br/>Ruby shook. Even from this distance she could smell the delicate scent of Nectar, the sweet smell of Mexican Nectar that was already beginning to erode her resistance...<br/><br/>Something large began to loom out of the fog.<br/><br/>"That's the <i>Farragut</i>," said Ruby as Jimmy, Dr. Orange, and Millicent burst into the saloon. As the ship began to shudder in the bow wake of the approaching steamer, Ruby concentrated on waking up...\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>...and the rising sun bathed them in the humid heat of a Yucatan jungle. The cries of jungle birds singing at the break of day were all around them, shrill and piercing. They were lying on some palm frond pallets, under a lean-to near the pyramid of Chichen Xoxul.<br/><br/>Next to Millicent was a suitcase. When she opened it, gold flashed in the red rays of dawn.<br/><br/>They brought the tablets to Queen Evening Star. "Your mother told us to return these to you," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"You are very interesting...strange alien devils," said the Queen.<br/><br/>"Gods," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Fine. What can I do for you, 'gods'?" said the Queen, making the Xoxul equivalent of air quotes.<br/><br/>"If we can depart the way we came with what we brought with us?"<br/><br/>"Ah, the arquebuses. The very small arquebuses. Belacazar was shooting them before."<br/><br/>"So amazing," said the Spaniard. "You can shoot them <i>twice</i> or more! I found that out by accident!"<br/><br/>"So did he," muttered Ruby, looking at a Xoxul with a bandage wrapped around his leg.<br/><br/>"We should police that brass," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"No, leave it," said Dr. Orange. "There's some research grant money in that, in five hundred years."<br/><br/>"Please allow us to leave, as your mother wished," said Geronimo.<br/><br/><i>[Reassurance spend by GP; the queen was still distrustful.]</i><br/><br/>"Very well. Oh, you," said the Queen, pointing at Jimmy. "One of my warriors wants you to have this war club. He said you fought reasonably well with him yesterday."<br/><br/>"Thanks," said Jimmy, fingering his battered nose. "It was worth it."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>They were taken to the top of the pyramid. The Xoxul priests opened up the trap door using some human blood, which they happened to have lying around.<br/><br/>"Water works just as well," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"No, it has to be blood, for the psychic energy!" the priests said.<br/><br/>"Doctor, stop insulting their culture," said Ruby. "You know what happened when Germans started insulting other cultures\u2026"<br/><br/>"The Enlightenment?"<br/><br/>They climbed down into the secret chamber. Dr. Orange went to the controls and studied the stone dials. He took out his notebook and consulted it while fiddling with the dials and levers.<br/><br/>"I think it's set to 1926," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>Millicent studied it, looking on with borrowed knowledge of physics. "Yes," she finally said. She grabbed the lever and pulled it down.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453202/#Comment_453202" name="Item_322" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-11T16:00:33+00:00" title="May 11, 2016  4:00PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XVI: Ashes to Ashes (Part 9)</b><br/><br/>Meanwhile, in the future...<br/><br/>Kakakatak removed their helmets and Tesla powered down the machinery.<br/><br/>"Do I have a mind, or am I just a brain?" asked Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Don't worry," said Tesla. "Kakakatak could explain, but only if you understand twelve-tone rows."<br/><br/>"Trust me Jimmy, you do not," said the Yithian. "Seriously, you had the worst diction ever."<br/><br/>"Did anything happen?" said Ruby. Geronimo shrugged.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>The next day they had a guest at the Los Angeles Society for Archaeological Studies. He was rail thin and wore a scraggly beard and had an unnatural air of silence around him.<br/><br/>"Dr. Ayers," said Ruby, surprised. "What brings you here?"<br/><br/>"I'm glad you're recovering," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Yes. Thank you. I am still having trouble talking. Every day. May I have water? I seem always to be thirsty. So Ram\xf3n's work is still a problem? Can I help? I knew Ram\xf3n very well."<br/><br/>They went to the conference room and made sure Ayers had a pitcher of water. He explained that Echevarr\xeda had used a lot of heavy machinery--the 1926 blackout was certainly caused by him stealing the city's power. He huddled with Dr. Orange to go over the details.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Jimmy decided to see if any houses near the new Temple of Joy were abandoned and useful to hide out in...or as a hiding place for Doug Henslowe. He spent the afternoon down at the property clerk's office pulling deeds for the housing development near the Temple site that had been abandoned when Trammel took over the area.<br/><br/>Geronimo hit his underworld contacts because as Ruby said, they were going to need guns. Lots of guns. While he was away, Ruby had another visitor.<br/><br/>"There's an Ashley Murphy to see you," her secretary said.<br/><br/>"Captain Murphy?" said Ruby. "Don't tell Geronimo. He gets jealous. And he has guns."<br/><br/><i>[I had started wondering why we never used Murphy's first name, so I guessed it was something he might find a bit embarrassing. And then one night I was watching </i>Ash vs. Evil Dead<i> and it clicked.]</i><br/><br/>She walked out into reception. Murphy, looking weatherbeaten as usual, was standing kneading his sailor's hat in his hands. A little girl, maybe six or seven years old, was standing next to him.<br/><br/>"Temperance?" said Ruby, clutching her chest.<br/><br/>"Hello, Mrs. Cuevas," said Murphy.<br/><br/>"What are you doing here?" asked Ruby.<br/><br/>"Well, two things. First I wanted you to meet Temperance here...I wasn't sure how to introduce you."<br/><br/>Ruby walked over to Temperance, knelt down, and put her arm on the little girl's shoulder.<br/><br/>"Hello," the girl said. "Who are you?"<br/><br/>"I'm a friend of your father's," Ruby said, tears in her eyes.<br/><br/>"Are you a sailor?"<br/><br/>"I'm an aviatrix. I fly planes."<br/><br/>"Like Amelia Earhart."<br/><br/>"Yes, exactly."<br/><br/>"She's dead. What happened to your arm?"<br/><br/>"Was kind of wondering that myself," said Murphy. "It wasn't Geronimo, was it? No? Didn't think so. He's a good a man."<br/><br/>"He's a good man to me," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"No," said Murphy with surprising conviction, "he's a good man, period."<br/><br/>"So are you, when you let yourself be."<br/><br/>"Maybe."<br/><br/>"I hurt myself in an accident."<br/><br/>"Ruby old girl, you have to take care of yourself. You're a very dear friend to me...and Temperance. Ruby, you think we can talk in private?"<br/><br/>"Sure. Temperance, you can go look around the place."<br/><br/><i>[RP: This is the beginning of her adventures!

"Ruby old girl, I understand you're still mixed up in something," said Murphy without preamble. "I want to help. I know what you're going to say--look after Temperance. But let's face facts, old girl. Probably I'm not the best father in the world. I want to be. But I also want to help you."<br/><br/>"I could use your help. Of course, I'd absolutely love for you to take Temperance far away from here and teach her to fish with a spear..."<br/><br/>"A normal childhood, sure.

"We're trying to get out of the business," said one <i>jefe</i>. "So it's a fire sale." It wasn't hard for the Spaniard to negotiate the purchase of quite an assortment of small arms.<br/><br/>"I guess you know Trammel's back," said the gang leader. "You know, there's still some Nectar on the street. Not a lot. He only sells it to the most important clients. But there's still some..."<br/><br/><i>[1 point Streetwise spend by GP.]</i><br/><br/>"Do you have any plastic explosive or dynamite?" asked Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Everything must go, friend." \n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Geronimo returned to the old hacienda-style house that LASAS used for its headquarters, the trunk of Jimmy's armored car stuffed with guns and explosives. As he walked into the building, he heard the sound of laughter coming from the dining room they used for a commissary.<br/><br/>Then he heard Murphy's voice: "Before we say anything else, we gotta say something in the memory of a great man. To Charlie!"<br/><br/>"To Charlie!"<br/><br/>There was the sound of shattering glass. Geronimo pulled a shotgun from the bundle of weapons he was lugging with him and ran into the dining room. He saw Murphy, several of his piratical looking henchmen, and Ruby sitting around a table littered with empty bottles and platters of cold cuts. <br/><br/>"Geronimo, don't shoot!" said Murphy.<br/><br/>"What are you doing in my house?" said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"It's not your house," muttered Jimmy to his scotch.<br/><br/>"I come in peace, Geronimo," said Murphy.<br/><br/>For the first time Geronimo noticed the small girl standing near Murphy. "I apologize, young miss," he said, lowering the shotgun. "It was not my intention to frighten you."<br/><br/>"You should hold it more against your shoulder. It makes it easier to work the pump. Daddy told me that," said Temperance.<br/><br/>"You must be Murphy's daughter." He turned to Ruby. "Ruby, explain."<br/><br/>Ruby screwed her arm back on straight. "In private."<br/><br/>They went to Ruby's office. "I can understand if you're upset," she said. "Murphy showed up out of the blue, with my daughter. And we don't know what we're up against, and we could any help we get in case we get shot up full of holes."<br/><br/>"We're going to get shot full of holes anyway."<br/><br/>"But at least this time there will be less chance of it happening. You don't have to worry about anything untoward."<br/><br/>"You seemed to be having a very good time."<br/><br/>"Geronimo, it's the end of the world. Of course I'm going to try and have a good time. You should join us. Have a drink for Charlie's sake. For our sake. That maybe we'll have a future."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Jimmy went to his office, fed up with Murphy's gang of salty dogs. As he closed the door behind him, he heard a gun cock. He turned slowly and backed toward his desk.<br/><br/>Doug Henslowe came out of the shadows, holding a mean looking .45. "Don't you try to stop me--" he began.<br/><br/>"Get you a drink?" asked Jimmy, going to his bar.<br/><br/>"Um, sure. Job's crazy."<br/><br/>"We're planning on stopping it."<br/><br/>"Good.

Jimmy and the others picked their way down the steep staircase to the Grand Plaza, which was choked with weeds and overgrowth. Fortunately they still had their machetes, so they began to hack their way through the forest.<br/><br/><i>[Outdoorsman spend here...by someone. Everyone had it by this point, I think.]</i><br/><br/>At sunset they stumbled into a poor Xoxul village. They were greeted by the elder of the village...a woman named Estrella.<br/><br/>Also visiting the village was an American archaeologist and his half-Mayan daughter, Nicole.<br/><br/>Everyone tried to hide their faces from the little girl. "We lost our way and got separated from our guide," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"What a shame. Dr. Nathaniel Luke," said the American.<br/><br/>"Ruby."<br/><br/>"Juan," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Well, I can get you folks up to M\xe9rida if you want."<br/><br/>"Thank you," said Ruby. The village elder kept staring at Jimmy.<br/><br/>"What did you say your name was?" she finally asked him.<br/><br/>"Jimmy Wright."<br/><br/>Estrella started to laugh to herself.<br/><br/>"We'll meet again," said Jimmy nonchalantly.<br/><br/>"Yes, yes we will!"\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>They discovered some problems with being in the past...such as their money not really being any good.<br/><br/>"I wish I could telegraph my father," Ruby said bitterly.<br/><br/>"Great idea. Just explain how you're in the Yucatan <i>and</i> at Barnard," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/><i>[All their Credit Rating was effectively three points lower. They also made a 1-point History spend to avoid accidentally talking about the future.]</i><br/><br/>"I could wire...I guess he was District Attorney-elect Grey in New York," mused Jimmy. "Of course, he's still in a wheelchair at this point."<br/><br/>"I'm going to sell some jewelry," said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Be careful, you might screw up the timestream..." began Jimmy.<br/><br/>"I bought all of this at an estate sale," said Ruby. "So...how are we to know that this wasn't how it was supposed to happen? Let's assume it was, before we get headaches and nosebleeds."<br/><br/>With that money they were able to book a steamer to New Orleans by way of Veracruz. Getting to Los Angeles took a bit longer than they were used to--train service wasn't as extensive to the West at that point.<br/><br/>On the sleeper coach one night, Jimmy asked Ruby what she was doing at this moment in 1925. The earlier Ruby, he meant.<br/><br/>"I know what you mean. Hrm...getting kicked out of my third boarding school, I think. Also discovering boys and gin."<br/><br/>"In that order?"<br/><br/>"I decline to say. You?"<br/><br/>"Somewhere in Shanghai, I think, meeting Lily...or maybe Singapore. Meeting Millicent's mom for the first time."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>They lived rough, staying in the cheapest flops, living rough when they could. Jimmy began to grow an especially fierce beard. Millicent and Dr. Orange spent some time studying the rubbings they had made of the golden tablets they had recovered from the SS <i>M\xe9rida</i>.<br/><br/><i>[1 point Library Use spend by MP.]</i><br/><br/>Dr. Orange concentrated on what looked suspiciously like field equations. For Millicent, however, what emerged was a fascinating story that seemed somehow related to certain Gnostic myths. <br/><br/>If a hole was rent in space and time, and a being bound heavily to spacetime--the Demiurge, or Yabaoleth, it seemed--and a specially prepared human was present, that human would become "The Render of Veils" also known as Daoloth.<br/><br/>And that would create a singularity, according to Dr. Orange, which would destroy the universe.<br/><br/><i>[I let the players make Cthulhu Mythos spends to create a "vs. Ritual" pool at the rate of 3 points of Ritual pool per CM point spent. JP and MP each spent 1 point...then even more, when MP realized that Cthulhu Mythos was an Academic skill and could be refreshed using her "Student" ability--basically, the same as the Reporter ability.]</i><br/><br/>"Well we know where and when this will happen even if we don't know who will be there," mused Millicent. "The night of January 13, 1926."<br/><br/>"Wait a second," said Jimmy. "Why didn't I see this before? What time would that have been in the Indian Ocean?"<br/><br/>"If the ritual began when the blackout happened...around noon on the 14th."<br/><br/>Jimmy groaned. "That's when the gate opened...when I did that thing...oh God, this is my fault..."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>They reached Los Angeles the day before Christmas Eve, 1925. Colored lights were strung on palm trees. In the speakeasies, bands played carols in jazz time.<br/><br/>They found a fleabag hotel near the railroad station. Jimmy spent a day or two seeing if he could get invited to one of Echevarr\xeda's party. He finally found a couple of socialites who could arrange it.<br/><br/>"They like guys like you," one explained to him. "You know, tough guys."<br/><br/>"Gangsters," said the other socialite.<br/><br/>Jimmy gave them a wolfish grin.<br/><br/>"Do you think you could score a case of Canadian for us as well?"<br/><br/>"Sure," said Jimmy. He'd read Bernie Ohls' notes on rumrunning in the 1920s, so he had a pretty good idea where he could hijack a shipment.<br/><br/>"You're going to <i>love</i> this party," oozed the first socialite. "They're like nothing else in the world." <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453221/#Comment_453221" name="Item_325" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-12T15:54:49+00:00" title="May 12, 2016  3:54PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XVI: Ashes to Ashes (Part 12)</b><br/><br/>"How are you going to convince them you're on Nectar?" demanded Geronimo when Jimmy explained his plan.<br/><br/>"I've worked in L.A. for years now.

It was a smallish house for the area, not much bigger than a concert hall. Some hard cases gave him a once over on the way in, including a particularly tough Mexican who took his gun.<br/><br/>"Evening, Walker," Jimmy said.<br/><br/>"How do you know my name?" said the future Captain Walker.<br/><br/>"We've met. Eventually."<br/><br/>Inside the party was already in full-swing, although most of the glittering crowd was still wearing their clothes. He caught sight of a young Olivia Clarendon in one corner. Standing by a punch bowl was a rail-thing young man. His hair was a bird's nest and he wore thick glasses.<br/><br/>"Edgar Job," muttered Jimmy to himself. A naked woman walked up with a tray of shotglasses full of Nectar.<br/><br/>"Drink and enjoy," she said. "It's part of our ritual."<br/><br/>"Of course," said Jimmy. He took a shotglass, turned slightly as if he had caught sight of someone he knew, and poured out the Nectar on the floor. When he turned back to the naked woman, his glass was full of honey cut with grain alcohol, a concoction Ruby had helped him make. She'd been very particular about the color.<br/><br/>Just then Ram\xf3n Echevarr\xeda walked into the room through a pair of French doors that led out to the garden. Jimmy began pushing through the crowd and bumped into a smallish man in an ill-fitting suit. <br/><br/>"Hey, watch it," said the man with a pronounced New York accent. "Who are you? I ain't seen you here before."<br/><br/>"I'm the new guy. From the Canadian."<br/><br/>"Right. Samson Tramell."<br/><br/>"Victor."<br/><br/>"You want we should do a shot of Nectar together?"<br/><br/>Jimmy paused.<br/><br/>"It's all right if you're shy," said Tramell.<br/><br/>"No, it's all right," said Jimmy. "I don't need that to be ready."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Around midnight, Jimmy made his way back to the main room. He noticed a distinguished man with a somewhat European air standing at the edge of the room. From the way he was watching events, Jimmy thought he wasn't on Nectar. The man caught his eyes and frowned, as if he recognized that Jimmy wasn't on Nectar either.<br/><br/>Jimmy sauntered over. "You are not on Nectar," the man said. He had a German accent. "Why are you not on Nectar? Are you not here for the party? Or are you here gathering information."<br/><br/>"Let's say I am very curious person."<br/><br/>"Listen my friend. Do not step on what we are doing here. I'm watching you. Clear? What's your name?"<br/><br/>"Victor."<br/><br/>"Victor, I'm Walter." He pronounced it the German way: <i>Valter</i>. "Last names are a little...I don't know if I trust you yet."<br/><br/>"Last names are baggage."<br/><br/>"<i>Ja</i>. Perhaps we should talk outside?"<br/><br/>"I was just about to suggest the same thing."<br/><br/>They sauntered out as nonchalantly as one can when one is sauntering out of an orgy, and walked along the driveway, Walter leading the way, Jimmy with his hands in his pockets. Suddenly he spun around; he'd felt eyes on his back.<br/><br/><i>[Sense Trouble roll by JP.]</i><br/><br/>He saw a stockily built man in a battered slouch hat emerge from the ornamental hedges along the driveway, his sawed-off shotgun leveled at him.<br/><br/>"Whaddya want me to do with him, Mr. Winston?" said the stocky man. He had a New York accent.<br/><br/>Jimmy's eyes went wide. <i>Walter Winston</i>, he thought. <i>Janet's father.</i><br/><br/>"Vince, put the gun down," said Winston. "I don't know what you are trying to do, Victor, but we have a very specific goal that we are following and we don't need any outside interference. <i>Verstehen</i>?"<br/><br/>"Got it," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"On the other hand, if we could trust you, you might offer some assistance, I think. You look like the kind of man who's seen some action."<br/><br/>"I'm a useful person to know. I know my way around, if you catch my meaning."<br/><br/>"Tomorrow. Musso and Frank's cafe, in Hollywood. You do know where that is, <i>ja</i>? Good. Are you alone?"<br/><br/>"For the moment."<br/><br/>"Do you have anyone else in on this? I don't need bunglers!"<br/><br/>"You can be assured that anyone with me is...damn well skilled for it."<br/><br/>"That may be. We'll be watching you."<br/><br/>He faded back into the shadows. Vince Stack--the man with the shotgun--grinned at Jimmy and walked back up the driveway.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453222/#Comment_453222" name="Item_326" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-12T15:55:23+00:00" title="May 12, 2016  3:55PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XVI: Ashes to Ashes (Part 13)</b><br/><br/>Jimmy caught a cab back to their flop.

Geronimo too."<br/><br/>"You are definitely not as ruggedly handsome as me."<br/><br/>"I've accepted my lot in life."<br/><br/>Ruby left them to decide who was the most handsome and went outside to smoke a cigarette. She thought she saw somebody watching her from a car parked across the street, but she couldn't be sure, and anyway he drove off before she finished her cigarette.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>The next day Jimmy walked into Musso and Frank's. It was just as he remembered it...would remember it; the first time he'd visited it was still six months off. He smiled at the green leather banquette booths, the brass finishings, and the smell of black coffee, illegal rum, and charring meat. He almost asked the headwaiter for his regular table, but caught himself in time.<br/><br/>He found Winston sitting at one of the booths, along with Stack and another man, a short, wiry looking fellow with a clean-shaven face and a devilish grin. It took him a second to place him.<br/><br/>It was Doug Henslowe, ten years younger and without his wild riot of a beard.<br/><br/>"Hi," said Doug. "Followed you last night. Where's the rest of your friends?"<br/><br/>Jimmy tried very hard not to glance over to where Millicent was sitting three booths down. "Taking care of their own things."<br/><br/>"We know something's up. We're going to break it up. Because we're reasonably sure it involves the end of the world. Something's getting summoned that we don't want called up."<br/><br/>"Summoning's never good."<br/><br/>"We asked Dr. Kullman about anyone matching your description, and he didn't know anyone like that. And he knows everyone in this kind of work. 'Cept maybe that crazy terrorist running around blowing up warehouses in China."<br/><br/>"Let's just say I'm very good at staying out of sight."<br/><br/>"How do we know we can trust you? How do we know you're not going to run back to Echevarr\xeda?"<br/><br/>"Because I like living. I don't want the end of the world."<br/><br/>"You got someone you want to save it for?"<br/><br/>"Yes," said Jimmy, looking at Winston. "I do."<br/><br/>"Well then, if we can trust you, you stay with us. You don't go back to your friends."<br/><br/><i>Congratulations</i>, thought Jimmy. <i>You're going to change history, Jimmy Wright.</i><br/><br/>"Look," he said. "You have your information. I have mine. We're working toward our plan. We don't know each other's plans. We'll just step on each other's toes. So you go your way, we'll go ours. If we see each other, then we can help each other."<br/><br/>"How do we know you won't screw this up? We've planned this very carefully. Nothing can go wrong with our plan."<br/><br/>"You've never heard of me. That's how good my people are."<br/><br/>"All right, <i>Jimmy</i>. That's right. I heard the name your friends call you last night. Stay clear of us. Lunch is on you."<br/><br/><i>[Two point Reassurance spend by JP to avoid going with the Winston Circle.]</i><br/><br/>He, Stack, and Winston got up and stalked out the front door.

Jimmy and company were already camped out there in one of the houses in the abandoned development Trammel had used as a cover for his own construction.<br/><br/>The New Temple of Joy was a surprisingly large structure. Most of it was taken up by a large open amphitheater, shaped like half an ellipse; behind it was a squat concrete building with two stubby wings breaking away from the ellipse. Heavy power cables were connected to the north wing.<br/><br/>"Herr Doktor, you're in charge of taking out the power," said Jimmy. "Without being seen."<br/><br/>Dr. Orange opened up a suitcase and took out a bunch of yellow silk robes that he had collected on their travels around the world. "These should match what they have," he said.<br/><br/>"Suit up," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>They crept through the parking lot and then got on line with everyone else. As they came up to the entrance on the south wing, they could see Trammel's rather large door guards--and the concrete machine gun pillbox that had been installed in the lobby of the entrance.<br/><br/>Ruby had been put in charge of their disguises this time. So they looked <i>good</i>. And also not like themselves--which was good, as Trammel almost certainly had them on a \u2018terminate on sight\u2019 list.<br/><br/>"Oh my god," chattered Jimmy in a most un-Jimmylike manner as they approached the entrance. "I am so glad we were able to come to this. Hey guys! Great day for it! Looking forward!" His patter distracted the guards, who waved them inside with a sigh.<br/><br/><i>[Disguise check by Ruby, then Flattery spend by Jimmy to get them past the guards.]</i><br/><br/>"Where is the crowd heading?" asked Ruby.<br/><br/>"West, to the arena," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Then Geronimo and I are heading east. I don't want to be around any Nectar that Trammel has."<br/><br/>"We're going north," said Millicent. <br/><br/>"I guess I'm going to the show," said Jimmy. "I guess I don't get a buddy."<br/><br/>"What about Kakakatak?" asked Ruby. They had stashed the Yithian inside a panel truck parked nearby.<br/><br/>"He'll come when I call, but he'll come hot and hard," said Jimmy. "Let's put that off for a while."<br/><br/>Jimmy vanished into the crowd without looking back.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>The amphitheater was surprisingly classic for something made of poured concrete. Jimmy could see a strange oval shaped house that pushed out past the edge of the arena...almost as if it was projecting into where some kind of elliptical energy field that was going to be generated around it.<br/><br/>On a raised dais between the two arms of the amphitheater Jimmy saw Trammel talking to Edgar Job. They were surrounded by bodyguards. Something was odd about the way Trammel's robes bulged out in the front.<br/><br/>"He couldn't...not...Ruby's <i>arm</i>," muttered Jimmy to himself.  He pushed himself lower down the banks of seats. Someone tried to stop him but Jimmy socked him in the gut and kept going.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>The interior of the building proved to be surprisingly mazelike, but Millicent and Dr. Orange were able to navigate it after a few false starts. Eventually they came to what had to be the power generating equipment, based on the smell of ozone and sounds of dynamos spinning up.<br/><br/>The doors looked very solid and were guarded by a couple of gorillas in boiler suits.<br/><br/>"Robes off," said the doctor. They slipped the silk gowns to the floor and strode forward wearing boiler suits remarkably like the ones the gorillas were wearing.<br/><br/>"We're here to check the regulators," said Dr. Orange to the head gorilla. "We don't want anything to blow up. You don't want stuff exploding, right?"<br/><br/>"No..." said the goon. "But I thought everyone was already inside."<br/><br/>"There's a missing part," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Trammel said it would be best to have someone bring it," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>The guards shrugged and slid back the door.<br/><br/><i>[This should have been an interpersonal spend but there isn't one on the recording."</i><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453224/#Comment_453224" name="Item_328" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-12T15:57:28+00:00" title="May 12, 2016  3:57PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XVI: Ashes to Ashes (Part 15)</b><br/><br/>Ruby and Geronimo were wandering through a series of cube-like rooms. Each was very similar, with metal fire doors at the junctions. The distribution of entrances seemed random--some rooms had four exits, others only two.<br/><br/>They came to a room that was painted blue. As Ruby walked through it, she felt a plate in the floor move slightly under her weight.<br/><br/>"Ger--" she said, right before the explosion.<br/><br/>It threw her bodily across the room. She slumped against one of the heavy doors. Geronimo picked himself up from the floor and stumbled over to her. His head was ringing and dust choked his eyes and mouth.<br/><br/>There was a lot of blood around Ruby.<br/><br/>A PA system activated. A man came on, speaking English with a pronounced Siamese accent. "Hello, Miss Ruby," said the voice. "How do you like my first delivery?"<br/><br/>"Pramoj," muttered Ruby. "He promised me a long correspondence."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>The power room was full of equipment even Dr. Orange was at a loss to understand, but there were several large turbines spinning up. The room was crowded with oilers and electricians. A few men patrolled catwalks, holding rifles.<br/><br/>They walked up to a man in a labcoat who was yelling at some technicians. "Check dynamo six! It's burning oil! What do you two want? Did Trammel send you? That idiot!"<br/><br/>"I know, I know," said Millicent. "What we can do?"<br/><br/>"Go degauss number three."<br/><br/>"Sure." They pushed their way over to one of the turbines.<br/><br/>"We need to sabotage this in such a way that we aren't here when it happens," muttered Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"I can break spacetime..." said Millicent.<br/><br/>"<i>Ja</i>, let's try to avoid it.

"If I press it, it will alert security that there is an intruder in the room. I haven't decided if I'm going to press it. Mr. Cuevas, my beef is not with you. You're free to leave any time you want."<br/><br/>"You know I can't do that!" shouted Geronimo.<br/><br/>"I might be inclined to let you live a little longer, if you can tell me where James Wright is. I know he's with you."<br/><br/>"James is here," croaked Ruby. "Helping us to do something right. Why don't you join us?"<br/><br/>"I prefer to continue our correspondence."<br/><br/>"Look, you can have your petty revenge, or you can help us do something worthwhile."<br/><br/>"I already helped you do something worthwhile, so I'm pretty much in the petty revenge section of this."<br/><br/>"Fine. James is out there, but if you could, don't kill us until we've completed what we want to do."<br/><br/>"I'll let you find your way." The door they had come in through slammed shut.

From their vantage point on a low hill off the road, Jimmy, Ruby, Millicent, Geronimo, and Dr. Orange watched a line of cars snake down the Valley toward a small farmhouse that was brightly lit from the inside.<br/><br/>Somewhere out there Ram\xf3n Echevarr\xeda was going to try and end the world.<br/><br/>They came down off the hill and made their way cross-country to the farmhouse. As they approached it, the swirling rain and fog giving them cover, they could see a ring of people circling the farmhouse and chanting.<br/><br/>"Why are they so happy?" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"They're all on Nectar," said Jimmy. "We need to figure out how to mix in with them."<br/><br/>"Don't worry," said Ruby. "I know how to act like a Nectar addict."<br/><br/>They waited until another group of revelers arrived and then walked into the circle. Some men in black robes--Jimmy recognized the original Samson Trammel as one of them--were trying to coordinate affairs.<br/><br/>The door to the farmhouse opened and Ram\xf3n Echevarr\xeda stepped out. "Good, good," he said with a sardonic smile. "Keep it up."<br/><br/>The crowd turned toward him and shouted ecstatic encouragement. In the confusion, Jimmy and company crept up to the side of the farmhouse and crouched down in the shadows.<br/><br/><i>[Reassurance spend by RP to keep them incognito, Stealth by MP to get them close.]</i><br/><br/>The rain slackened for a moment and Millicent pointed over the hills, toward where the glow of lights from Los Angeles lit up the clouds. The light began to fade.<br/><br/>"The blackout must have started," she said.<br/><br/>"They're powering up," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>Millicent peaked into the farmhouse through a crack in the clapboard siding. Inside she saw something that took her breath away. With her head held at just the right angle, the back wall of the room <i>went away</i>, and she could see a large concrete amphitheater behind it, packed with people wearing yellow robes.<br/><br/>"My god," she said. "It's the same as on the plans we saw before we left 1937!"<br/><br/>The ground began to shake behind them.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>"All right, we're done here. You guys are doing great, but we gotta get back to Mr. Trammel," Dr. Orange told the guards at the door of the generator room.<br/><br/>"All right," one of them grunted. He slid back the door and they sauntered out, turned a corner, and began to run.<br/><br/>Behind them they heard one of the dynamos begin to make a horrible, rending screech. There was a sound of something heavy giving way, mixed with screaming.<br/><br/>The lights began to flicker. Arc lights began to explode. In the amphitheater, Jimmy took advantage of the confusion to draw his gun just before everything was plunged into darkness.<br/><br/>Slowly a light began to glow at the edge of the amphitheater. It was unearthly, and Jimmy had the experience to make that call, filling the arena with an actinic blue glow. He tried to stare at the source of the light.<br/><br/>It was the Singularity.<br/><br/>He couldn't really <i>see</i> it of course. His mind had a vague impression of some kind of vortex bound in spherical form, but in truth his conscious mind revolted at even trying to parse what he was seeing.<br/><br/><i>[Indeed. 4 points of Stability lost here.]</i><br/><br/>Beyond the Singularity in the shadows, he thought he saw someone spin around with a gun. He began to take aim but suddenly realized that he couldn\u2019t see Edgar Job anywhere.<br/><br/>He jumped down to the ground just as he heard a shot ring out. Someone behind him shouted in pain.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>As the ground shook in 1926, Jimmy caught sight for a second of the amphitheater. He saw someone in the crowd draw a gun, so he fired off a shot at him. Unfortunately the man had jumped out of the way and he just hit someone in the crowd.<br/><br/>Something burst from the ground behind them. Something that stank of Nectar. Something with long arms, a headless, flabby, humanoid. Ruby felt her mind begin to go. She turned and began to run at the monster, all thoughts of self-preservation evaporating in the siren call of this monstrous being.<br/><br/>Dimly she heard Echevarr\xeda shouting from inside the farmhouse. She threw a brief glance backward and saw Jimmy charge into the farmhouse. In a flash, she Vince Stark holding a shotgun on Echevarr\xeda, Jimmy raising his Xoxul war club to strike down Edgar Job...<br/><br/>And a woman in a frowsy black dress.<br/><br/>"'Ello, love," she said. "So you remembered my gift."<br/><br/>"Take them back," panted Ruby as the Liar opened Its arms to receive her. "Take the last five minutes back!"<br/><br/>"You can expect some paradox, you know. But I'm in a hurry, gotta meet Geronimo a few minutes from now in 1937.

"Good, good," he said with a sardonic smile. "Keep it up."<br/><br/>"Go, go <i>now</i>," said Ruby to her friends. "All of us into the house!"<br/><br/>"You seem awful sure," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"She's seen the future," said Jimmy. "I know what that sounds like! Let's go."<br/><br/>While everyone stared at Echevarr\xeda, they made a loping run for the farmhouse and circled around the back, next to a dilapidated side door. Inside they could hear Echevarr\xeda talking with someone.<br/><br/>"We need to go in and look at the Singularity," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Wait," said Jimmy. "All the people out there have to die to preserve the timeline."<br/><br/>"I don't see what that has to do with seeing the Singularity."<br/><br/>"Let's wait until we feel the ground shake, then go inside in a rush," said Ruby.<br/><br/>The rain came down harder. They felt a distant tremor in the earth. Jimmy nodded, and they kicked in the door. As he came in Jimmy bumped into the back of Vince Stack, who stumbled forward and put a round into the ceiling from his sawed-off shotgun.<br/><br/>Echevarr\xeda tore his eyes off of Walter Winston. "Who the hell are--YOU!" He pointed a finger at Jimmy.<br/><br/>Geronimo fired both barrels of his shotgun in Echevarr\xeda's face.<br/><br/>As the cult leader fell, Millicent saw Edgar Job hiding behind a bale of hay. He seemed to have some rainbow edge around him, at least to her eyes.<br/><br/>Behind them, they could hear something tearing itself out of the ground.<br/><br/>"What have you done?" shouted Winston. "Well, I mean...good, saved us the trouble...wait...what the hell is that outside!"<br/><br/>Geronimo wiped his shotgun down with his handkerchief and handed it to Vince Stack,<br/><br/>Millicent ran forward. "It's Job, it's Job!" she shouted. "He's the Singularity!" She tackled him, stabbing at him with her knife. Job stabbed back with his ceremonial knife, but she knocked it from his hands and it rolled over to Jimmy. Millicent and Job rolled on the floor closer and closer to the threshold of the Singularity, until they rolled over it...and vanished.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Geronimo carefully set his plastic explosive charges and then ran back to crouch over Ruby. There was a loud bang, and then the door to their room fell backwards with a crash. He helped Ruby up and they staggered into the hall.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Dr. Orange and Millicent were fleeing toward the amphitheater. The German turned a corner and suddenly felt himself violently picked up and then thrown fifteen feet down the corridor.<br/><br/>Millicent stopped dead as Mirabelle stepped around the corner. "Hello, sis," she said, and then seized Millicent around the neck.<br/><br/>Millicent clutched her neck with her hand. She felt the bronze pendant of Jack Brady's necklace under her hand and concentrated on it...<br/><br/>There was a tittering noise all around her and Mirabelle. <i>Something</i> latched onto Mirabelle. <i>Something</i> began sucking blood into itself, slowly beginning to outline some horror from beyond the stars...<br/><br/><i>[A Star Vampire, in fact! It's what the necklace summons!]</i><br/><br/>Mirabelle snarled and slapped at whatever was draining her, dropping Millicent. There was a sound like a flabby balloon smashing into a wall as the <i>something</i> was smashed away. Millicent staggered up and began to run, with her sister in pursuit.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Geronimo and Ruby came limping into the amphitheater just in time to see Jimmy running toward...toward...toward...<br/><br/>Toward half a farmhouse, which incongruously had appeared at the end of the amphitheater.<br/><br/>"Isn't that..." said Ruby.<br/><br/>"Jimmy. Two of them," groaned Geronimo.<br/><br/>Jimmy dashed up to the boundary and came to a halt just outside the farmhouse. "Where is that bastard?" he said.<br/><br/>The 1926 Jimmy pointed with his Xoxul war club at the corpse of the sorcerer.<br/><br/><i>[I didn't ask the players to track two character sheets, but I did give them a card to track health and Stability separately for each version of the PCs.

"You...you...youse..." said Stack.<br/><br/>"We have to find Job and do something about the Singularity," said both Jimmys simultaneously. Disconcertingly, the Jimmy on the 1937 side of the boundary was now holding the club. He didn't recall how he got it.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Mirabelle, Millicent, and Dr. Orange emerged into the demi-ellipse.<br/><br/>Mirabelle seemed to punch the air. There was a burst of blood, and the sound of <i>something</i> shrieking. She spun around to face Millicent.<br/><br/>"I want your brain!" she bellowed. "The brain from your past self! I know she's near!"<br/><br/>"If you have it, you won't be you, you'll be me!"<br/><br/>"What?!" Mirabelle grabbed her by the throat and lifted her up in the air.<br/><br/>"I want you to <i>live</i>. I want a sister. But if I give you my brain you'll stop being you!"<br/><br/>"I don't understand!"<br/><br/>"Open your mind! Read what is in mine! You and I, we <i>understand</i> each other, in all the seventeen dimensions that we can reach!"<br/><br/>Mirabelle lowered her to the ground. "But I'm a revenant!

The rear doors opened, and with a shout Murphy and his men leapt to the ground, firing rifles in the air. <br/><br/>Betty jumped out of the cab of the last truck. She and Murphy yanked open the rear doors of the truck and lowered a ramp.<br/><br/>Kakakatak glided down from the truck with an astonishing grace for something so alien. It regarded the crowd in the stands for a moment, the spun away with complete disregard for them. The Yithian moved swiftly and smoothly toward the Singularity.<br/><br/>To its senses, there was nothing confusing about the Singularity. Oh, of course such a distortion in the local spacetime was <i>dangerous</i>, but the situation was well in hand. That was not what made Kakakatak\u2019s multiple hearts flutter as it approached the vortex. No, it was the siren call of what lay on the other side of the Singularity, the promise that resolving the closed timelike loop held out: <i>home</i>, the return to the collective Yithian consciousness, the camaraderie of other minds like itself.<br/><br/>If, perhaps, no <i>friends</i>. But that was a human conception. It could ignore that.<br/><br/>As well as the loneliness that stabbed it with a sudden pang.<br/><br/>Someone stepped out of the smoke that had gathered in the amphitheater. Kakakatak noticed it coming but paid it no mind. The other didn\u2019t see the Yithian until he was standing directly in front of it. Between the damage done to the generator room and the gunfire Murphy\u2019s men were exchanging with the guards, visibility was probably pretty low for anyone not equipped with infrared vision and another three senses humans didn\u2019t have words for.<br/><br/>The human in front of it was trying to say something. Kakakatak engaged the part of its brain that was slow enough to understand humans.<br/><br/>"\u2026Monster! Get back! I am Goodman Black, the prophet of Nyarlathotep, herald of Daoloth, the alpha and the omega! My message is of love, but believe me that if you continue to interfere I will smite\u2026"<br/><br/>Without saying anything, Kakakatak snipped Black\u2019s head off with one massive claw. The human stopped talking and its body started to slip to the earth. Kakakatak sliced through its abdomen before it hit the ground, to make observations of the trunk of the creature easier.<br/><br/>Something was still moving under Black\u2019s clothes. Kakakatak bent down and ripped open the dark robes with its mouth tentacles. Fused to the chest of the man was a forearm. It was smaller than the man\u2019s own forearms and moved with a sickly sort of grace that was almost feminine. The arm was golden colored and Kakakatak could detect some kind of heavy preservative that had been used on it.<br/><br/>On the inside of the arm was a small, lipless mouth. It was cursing and spitting in a rather distasteful language that the Yithian stopped deciphering after realizing it was composed only of obscenities. Kakakatak swept its claw down and sliced the arm from Goodman Black\u2019s chest. It bent its head down to pick up the arm with its mouth tentacles.<br/><br/>"I\u2019ll have that, thank you very much," said a woman behind him. She slipped around his vast conical bulk and gathered the arm up in her hands. She looked up at the Yithian from behind pince-nez, and then held up a section of the long red scarf that was wrapped tightly around her neck. <br/><br/>"If you don\u2019t mind," she said. "I\u2019d like to wrap this thing up for transport."<br/><br/>If it is possible for a being capable of predicting the most statistically improbable time events to be taken aback, then Kakakatak was. It hesitated for a moment, and then with shocking gentleness cut the scarf close to the woman\u2019s neck with one huge lobster claw.<br/><br/>"Thank you, Kakakatak," said Mina. She wound the cloth around the severed arm and then walked quickly away into the smoke and fog.<br/><br/><i>[End Deleted Scene!]</i><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453237/#Comment_453237" name="Item_332" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-12T21:31:10+00:00" title="May 12, 2016  9:31PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Er, I didn't figure out CM was an academic ability -- you had to outright tell me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453238/#Comment_453238" name="Item_333" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-12T21:47:24+00:00" title="May 12, 2016  9:47PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            IIRC, Jimmy's comment about not needing to be that ready was phrased as very flattering to Trammel.

If you succeed," said the Yithian.<br/><br/>Jimmy--the Jimmy on the 1937 side of boundary--tossed his 1926 self Kakakatak's lightning gun.  His 1926 self flipped him Job\u2019s dagger\u2026and his rabbit\u2019s foot.<br/><br/>"One version of each of you should go into the Singularity," said the Yithian.

Neither of them perceived anything unusual. At least not for them.<br/><br/>Millicent could see both Jobs, the rail-thin student from 1926 and the shattered wreck of a man from 1937. She could <i>feel</i> the Daoloth software running on both Jobs, merging them together in her understanding.<br/><br/>"My lady," said Job. He bowed.<br/><br/>"You're the Singularity! That's bad!"<br/><br/>"We are here to do what you are here to do."<br/><br/>"I'm here to save the planet!"<br/><br/>"No..."<br/><br/>"Yes!

All the people I love are here!"<br/><br/>"But you were born to destroy it."<br/><br/>"I don't want to do it!"<br/><br/>"But you see, it is what you were <i>born</i> for."<br/><br/>Millicent felt the pressure of his words somehow. He was <i>right</i>, she knew that now; that she had been conceived and brought into the world, an encapsulation of millennia of understanding, a microcosm of entire universes contained within herself.<br/><br/>She squeezed her eyes shut. "I don't <i>care</i>," she said. "I'm not going to do it!"<br/><br/><i>[This was a Hard Driver vs. her Drive; my plan was to try and drive Millicent down to 0 Sanity.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Ruby stepped over the Singularity boundary...<br/><br/>...and found herself on a road made of yellow bricks. She vaguely remembered the children's books her governess had read to her as a child.<br/><br/>The road forked ahead of her as it wound through a cornfield. On the left fork was...her, whether image or projection or statue she wasn't sure. This version had a left arm. On right fork was an exact duplicate of her as well, only with her familiar stump for a left arm.<br/><br/>In between the forks, a scarecrow had been put up. Somehow it resembled Jimmy. "See, Ruby, if you continue in the Singularity and close it, your 1926 form might vanish, and with it your arm! Of course, what do I know, I don't have a brain!

He was wearing a morning jacket and striped trousers. Janet stood in front of him in a beautiful, elaborate wedding gown. Behind her Ruby stood, in a particularly ugly bridesmaid's dress.<br/><br/>Geronimo was standing next to him, looking impatient. "Hurry up, man, say your vows," said Geronimo.<br/><br/>"Dearly beloved," intoned the pastor, "This future will probably never happen now." There was a tremendous crash and his mind reeled.<br/><br/><i>[4 points of Stability loss to Jimmy.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Geronimo was crawling over a vast plateau, pockmarked by trenches and shell holes.

It probably wasn't even important.<br/><br/>"This must be some kind of Hilbert problem," said another.

She felt the forces connecting Job to the Singularity with the senses she didn't even know she had and tried to sever them. Tears streamed down her face. She knew she would never see Vanessa again.<br/><br/><i>[So, Millicent used Cthulhu Mythos to drain points from Job's Resistance pool. This cost her Stability as well, and took her Stability to -6. At this point the poor girl was down to 1 Sanity. Still, she Challenged her Vanessa value to refresh a point of Stability for the attack, which drained 4 from Job's Resistance.]</i><br/><br/>"Since you won't help me voluntarily," snarled Job. "I'll just have to <i>make</i> you." He wrapped his hands around her throat and began choking her. She grabbed him by the throat as well and they both fell down, rolling on the void while the stars glared down. Then they suddenly flared brightly, so brightly that everyone had to close their eyes, so brightly that they could feel their skin burning.<br/><br/>"The Singularity is collapsing!" said Dr. Orange. He rolled toward Job, grabbing Ruby and Geronimo on the way.<br/><br/>"No!" shouted Job. "This isn't right! This isn't how it happens--"<br/><br/>Dr. Orange kicked him in the face, knocking him backwards and tumbling through emptiness. He unknit spacetime around them and they vanished...<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453271/#Comment_453271" name="Item_336" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-13T19:14:37+00:00" title="May 13, 2016  7:14PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XVI: Ashes to Ashes (Part 20)</b><br/><br/>Millicent watched Job flying backwards into space with a rapt awe, an awful sinking feeling gathering in her stomach. So she never saw Jimmy coming.<br/><br/>He had managed to pull himself up onto the pillar that wasn\u2019t really there and somehow launched into a flying tackle, knocking the girl to the ground with him on top of her. He pinned her shoulder to the void with one hand while fumbling in his jacket with the other.<br/><br/>"I'm sorry," he said.<br/><br/>"Take care of Vanessa and my sister," said Millicent.<br/><br/>"I will."<br/><br/>He pulled the ibis-headed Dagger of Thoth from out of his jacket and stabbed it down into her chest. She sighed, and then began to <i>dissolve</i> away beneath him, fading into sparkling dust against the burning stars all around them.<br/><br/>Jimmy stood up and turned around. That's when he saw me. I was standing, hovering you might say, on the void, silhouetted against the actinic brilliance of the collapsing Singularity. I was wearing a frowsy black dress and a human form.<br/><br/>I like to keep things consistent, you see. Helps the poor sods along.<br/><br/>"Well, love," I said to him. "So this is where I get me revenge on you?"<br/><br/>Jimmy stared back at me, uncomprehending. I'm used to that.<br/><br/>"I have so many lovely things to show you," I said, and took a step forward.<br/><br/>Without a word, he spun the dagger in his hand and plunged it directly into his own heart as the Singularity winked out of existence.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>To those left in 1937, they saw a sudden flash of light and felt a strange sensation, as if time and space were reknitting around them.<br/><br/>"I'm reknitting time and space around us," said Kakakatak.<br/><br/>They could still see 1926 in front of them, the half-farmhouse with the body of Ram\xf3n Echevarr\xeda and the puzzled-looking Vince Stack and Walter Winston.<br/><br/>Jimmy threw Job's ceremonial dagger at Vince Stack, as hard as he could. It would have been a difficult throw under most circumstances, let alone the wild changes in weight and momentum around the collapsing Singularity. Still it found its mark almost as if fated. Stack dropped to the ground, bleeding.<br/><br/>Winds lashed them. A vortex of air and dust was forming around the Singularity. There were flashes of static and a smell of ozone, a distant roaring in their ears. Everything looked eldritch and distorted.<br/><br/>Ruby saw a shape loom up out of the cloud--herself, whole, with a flesh and blood left arm. Somehow she knew that if she really wanted to, she could reach out and make this image of her reality.<br/><br/>"No," she whispered after a long pause. "I think I've finally learned to leave well enough alone."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>They felt weightless. Time twisted in thrashing loops, catching them in its sinews. Geronimo found himself cast again and again to that horrible day when his brother died, each time just as powerless as the last to save Rodolfo.<br/><br/>Dr. Orange was cast forward in time for a while: to Oswiecim, Poland, to Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen. He saw every inch of the horrors his countrymen had imagined, saw the dead piling up around him, and knew, <i>knew</i> that this was no vision but a premonition, that what he had seen would be true and he would have to live with the knowledge of what was to come without the power to stop it.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Mirabelle and Millicent clutched each other. "What should we do?" said Mirabelle.<br/><br/>"We could combine ourselves!" said Millicent.<br/><br/>"Do you want that?"<br/><br/>"No! I want you to live!"<br/><br/>"I want you to live to, sister!"<br/><br/>They fell down into darkness together.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Jimmy was alone.<br/><br/>Gusts of wind assaulted him. He seemed to see with doubled vision--a hell of blazing stars where some vast menace was approaching him, and his other self, battered, tossed like flotsam on this great storm of time itself.<br/><br/>He pulled out his rabbit's foot and held it up. He watched it begin to fade from his sight. And he knew that this time he had truly lost it--that this time, its very existence had been undone, that all the memories he had of it--the day his sister gave it to him, the way Francis had made fun of it, the countless burns and scars a decade of adventuring had inflicted on it--were all gone now, nothing but the dried leaves of recollections locked inside his own head.<br/><br/>He gritted his teeth and leaned into the wind.<br/><br/><i>[So I kept track of paradox individually and as a group; these bits were me making Moves based on how much paradox each PC had received.]</i><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453272/#Comment_453272" name="Item_337" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-13T19:15:05+00:00" title="May 13, 2016  7:15PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XVI: Ashes to Ashes (Part 21)</b><br/><br/>Then they were back in the amphitheater. Murphy\u2019s men were herding the crowd out. They weren\u2019t being very polite about it.<br/><br/>Kakakatak was nowhere to be seen.<br/><br/>Hanging in space in front of them was an afterimage, slowly fading, of the 1926 farmhouse. They turned away from it, Geronimo offering his shoulder for Ruby to lean on.<br/><br/>There was a ripple in the air behind them. Something lashed through the air, a barbed tentacle with horrible saw-toothed edges. It drove into Geronimo's back and exploded in a burst of blood from his chest.<br/><br/>The tentacle pulled back and vanished into the past.<br/><br/>Ruby was screaming as Geronimo slumped to the ground in a quickly spreading pool of blood. Jimmy was yelling something to Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"It's too late," said the German. "He's dead, Jim."<br/><br/>Using all his strength, Geronimo pushed up from the ground. "<i>No</i>," he said in a harsh whisper.<br/><br/>And a woman in a frowsy black dress was standing in front of him. I was standing in front of him.<br/><br/>"When it came down to it, soldier of God, you weren't really willing to die for your beliefs," Nyarlathotep said. "I just wanted to say, <i>I told you so</i>.

"If in rather enormous pain."<br/><br/>"He\u2019s stable," said Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>"I feel strong," said Geronimo. "But what is my prognosis?"<br/><br/>"You were stabbed through the <i>heart</i>.

His longtime driver and girl friday Andrea met them.<br/><br/>"Hey Boss," she said.<br/><br/>"Hey," he said softly.<br/><br/>"What? You're looking at me funny. You know I always tell you you're crazy, right Boss?"<br/><br/>"You do, Betty. I mean Andrea."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Everyone stayed away from each other for a few months. Christmas came and went. And in January of 1938 Senator and Mrs. Grey had their annual holiday party again, down in Orange County. It was supposed to be a festive occasion. After all, they had managed to save the world--twice, in Jimmy's case. But nobody felt much like celebrating.<br/><br/>Janet found Jimmy in Senator Grey's enormous, plush library--the same room Janet had talked to them all a year ago and sent them down the road of blood and madness.<br/><br/>"Hello, Jimmy," she said. <br/><br/>"Janet," he said. He stared at the diamond ring on her finger. <i>Of all the things to stay unchanged</i>, he thought glumly, <i>that had to remain. That should never have happened.</i><br/><br/>"How's saving the world treating you?" She followed his eyes to the ring. She sighed. "Jimmy, I understand. Just because you saved my father's life ten years ago doesn't mean you have to marry me. I know...I probably goaded you into it."<br/><br/>He stared at her blankly.<br/><br/>"What's wrong with you? I had a crush on you from the moment Dad tracked you down in your office in New York, right before you moved to Los Angeles. You were so...damn <i>decent</i>. And I mean I'm glad you helped Dad. If you hadn't been there for him...well, I don't know how it would have gone. He might have been really <i>broken</i> by what he saw."<br/><br/>"I feel a little woozy."<br/><br/>"If you don't want to marry me...I can live with it. If...if you don't really love me. If you're only doing this to make Dad happy. He's in his seventies, Jimmy. He won't be around much longer...and then you'll be free, I guess."<br/><br/>"Your dad...isn't dead. Right."<br/><br/>"What is wrong with you?"<br/><br/>"I can't. I can't do this anymore. <i>Any</i> of this. I do love you. But sometimes it's not enough."<br/><br/>"I understand," she said bitterly, turning away.<br/><br/>Jimmy stepped outside and flagged down some drinks. When he came back into the library, Janet was holding out the diamond ring in the palm of her hand.<br/><br/>He took it without a word.<br/><br/>"I'm still going to write a book about this," she said, and then pushed past him and out of his life.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453273/#Comment_453273" name="Item_338" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-13T19:15:36+00:00" title="May 13, 2016  7:15PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XVI: Ashes to Ashes (Part 22)</b><br/><br/>After the party, Ruby finally felt up to going back to the Los Angeles Society for Archaeological Studies. They had a lot of things to file away, after all. Her husband came with her, along with Dr. Orange.<br/><br/>Much to her surprise, the place was humming with activity. They stood in the conference room on the ground floor, staring at the many young women who were busy typing up notes.<br/><br/>Mina came in the door, her long scarf tossed over one shoulder. "Ah, you're here. We have so much to talk about. I hope you don't mind, Ruby, I took your office, we'll get you a better one when we move."<br/><br/>"Move?"<br/><br/>"Yes, this space is far too limited for what we'll be doing." She looked at Ruby over her pince-nez, and sighed. "Look. You need a director, someone who knows what they are doing, can run a large organization. Yes? That's why you hired me. You're welcome."<br/><br/>"Thank you?"<br/><br/>"Dr. Orange," said Mina. "We've been looking for a man of your skills for our physics department. May I offer you a situation? The salary won't be much at the start, however you will avoid a rather messy treason trial."<br/><br/>"That sounds good," said the German. "I like America." He began to hum <i>America the Beautiful</i>.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>And so four years passed. Millicent, as surprised as anyone to still be around, spent most of her time helping her sister learn to be a human...well, a close approximation of a human. In time, Millicent herself learned to stop worrying about "being real". There was college--Miskatonic University, of course--to go to, and time to spend with her mother, who was going to come home from the asylum <i>any day</i> now. Sometimes she had long conversations in her dreams with Charlie and Ruby.<br/><br/>"So you're the dream-projection of a dead demigod," said Charlie once. "When you get down to it, what's the difference? I'm just a dream-projection of Ruby."<br/><br/>"How is that?" asked Millicent.<br/><br/>"Pretty boring. I've learned a lot about fashion. I know everything there is to know about Milan; I just don't care.

They had two children, Rodolfo--Rudy to his friends--and Charlotte. But everyone called her Charlie.<br/><br/>Temperance spent time in the finest boarding schools, and only got kicked out of one of them. She could shoot like an Olympian, sail like a pirate, and was already interested in learning how to fly a plane. Most of the time she lived with Captain Murphy and his new wife, the former Karen Eliot.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Jimmy had vanished. The rest of them followed him as best they could, tracking the withdrawals and deposits of a secret account he had access to. Ruby kept a bulletin board in her office with all the stories of mysterious strangers showing up in the nick of time to save people from dangers that seemed almost supernatural. Many had a picture of a man hunching to get out of the camera shot, or as if he carried the weight of the world on his back, hurrying away from the scene.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>The 1942 holiday party that the Greys threw was a somber affair. Many of the guests attended in brand new Army or Navy dress uniforms. It was only five weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor, but already there was an ominous sense that it might be the last time many of them would see each other.<br/><br/>Ruby was astonished to see Jimmy slip in, accompanied by a couple of M.P.s. She embraced him tightly. <br/><br/>"Stay here," she said. "I'll go get the others."<br/><br/>Jimmy noticed that she limped. <br/><br/>"Good to see you, son," said Senator Grey, walking up and pumping his hand. "There's a man from the War Department wants to see you, but get settled first. Everything's changing now. I get to like FDR publicly now. You're looking good. I like the scar."<br/><br/>Millicent walked by and handed Jimmy a double bourbon without a word. Mirabelle chased after her. She grabbed Jimmy's shoulder as she went by. "Hello, James," she whispered. "By the way, <i>dad says hi</i>."<br/><br/>Jimmy drifted over to the edge of the room. Suddenly he stopped and turned around slowly.<br/><br/>"Hello, Janet," he said.<br/><br/>"Jimmy. How nice of you to wander in from the cold."<br/><br/>"I read your 'novel'."<br/><br/>"They're thinking of making a movie, if they can get the right director. And special effects."<br/><br/>"Tentacles?" he said with a grin.<br/><br/>"Turns out it really <i>is</i> difficult to get them to undulate."<br/><br/>"How have you been?"<br/><br/>"Dad died last year. Guess you couldn't make the funeral. Tell me, you still have that ring, or did you sell it?"<br/><br/>She didn't throw her drink in his face before stalking off, but he flinched as if she had.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Someone tapped him on his shoulder from behind. He sighed and turned around. A nondescript man of average height and build, with grey hair, grey eyes, and a grey suit, was standing stiffly in front of him.<br/><br/>"Are you James Wright?" the man said.<br/><br/>"If I said no, will you believe me?"<br/><br/>The man considered this for a moment. "No. You <i>are</i> James Wright. You have knowledge of the Great Race of Yith." It wasn't a question.<br/><br/>"Yes, I have."<br/><br/>"Allow me to introduce myself. I am Kakakatak. I understand you had some dealings with a different branch of me at one point. That branch's activities during the Great Temporal Crisis were noted with approval in the collective."<br/><br/>"Sure."<br/><br/>"I must ask for a certain object that branch transported backward in time to give to you. Against all regulations, I might add. I'm not usually so loose on rules. That branch clearly fell under the bad influence of someone. The dagger, please."<br/><br/>Jimmy handed him the ibis-headed Dagger of Thoth.<br/><br/>"Thank you," said Kakakatak. "I will put it back where it will be. It is a shame that I don't remember you much. Thus is temporal mechanics. Your tiny human brain would not understand."<br/><br/>He held out his hand. Jimmy shook it. Kakakatak's face took on an unusual expression, as if he was shocked to discover something. "Goodbye...old friend."<br/><br/>He limply let go of Jimmy's hand.<br/><br/>"See you again," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>"Oh. I was left a message by myself to place a call for you. You should pick up that phone."

This girl I know at school gave it to me. Sorry, but I have to go mister. It\u2019s time to feed the pigs."<br/><br/>"Have a good life," said Jimmy softly, and hung up.<br/><br/><i>[On the recording there's some laughter at that line, but let me tell you...this is what I roleplay for. JP did a wonderful job this whole episode of conveying Jimmy's utter collapse, and then capped it off with this beautifully understated scene.]</i>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Vanessa had been released from the asylum at last, just in time for Christmas. Millicent and Mirabelle brought her over to Ruby.<br/><br/>"I'm so glad to see you both," Vanessa was saying to them. "It...sometimes seems strange there are two of you...but I think that's all right?"<br/><br/>"It's perfect," said Millicent. "And you look wonderful."<br/><br/>"And this must be...Ruby, yes?" said Vanessa. "Ruby...Fitzgibbons?"<br/><br/>"Fitzgibbons Cuevas," said Millicent. "Ruby, this is Vanessa. My mother."<br/><br/>"How wonderful to finally meet you," said Ruby. "I've heard so much about you."<br/><br/>"Thank you. Your hair <i>is</i> very red, isn't it?"<br/><br/>"Oh, thank you."<br/><br/>"Who does it for you?"\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Dr. Born and Dr. Orange met at the bar. "Julius! Happy New Year! Let's consult the list of things we are allowed to talk about with each other."<br/><br/>They flipped through their government-issued notebooks.<br/><br/>"The Yankees," said Dr. Born. "I think they will win the World Championship again."<br/><br/>"I favor the team from Brooklyn," said Dr. Orange. "And the war, that's terrific, isn't it?"<br/><br/>"Nice talk. Let's do this again next year."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Senator Grey brought Jimmy into his library. In one corner, half in the shadows, was a tall, rugged man wearing a Marine colonel's uniform.<br/><br/>"This is that guy from the War Department who wanted to see you," said the Senator.<br/><br/>"Hello, Francis," said Jimmy.<br/><br/>Francis O'Donnell stalked into the light. "Jimmy," he barked without preamble. "I have a mission for you."<br/><br/>"What are you doing with the war department?"<br/><br/>"SERVING MY COUNTRY! There's a little outfit we\u2019re forming, the Organization of Strategic Services. I'll tell you about it on the way."\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Dawn broke clear and cold the morning of the 14th of January. Inside the Grey's mansion, the party was still in swing. Jimmy opened a second story window, crawled out on the windowsill, and then slid down a drainpipe. <br/><br/>He froze for a second, listening intently while glancing around. Finally he waved for Francis to come down as well and turned the corner of the house.<br/><br/>Ruby was standing there waiting for him. "Look who finally learned how to sneak up on people," she said.<br/><br/>Jimmy frowned, then shook his head, then sighed. "I guess I can't keep you from coming, can I?"<br/><br/>"I love you for even asking the question. Where are we headed?"<br/><br/>"Burma, to start," said Francis, coming around the corner. "Both you and your husband are coming, I take it? Good. I think I have something just right for your talents."<br/><br/>And a few hours later, the <i>Brightening Dawn</i> lifted up, turned over the Bay, silhouetted against the sun. Below, Los Angeles woke to another day, or turned in from yet another endless night shift. But that didn't matter, in the long run. It didn't matter if they were rich or poor, they were still free even if they didn't know it. For the moment.<br/><br/>Free, in a way they couldn't appreciate. Free to be ignorant, free to think that a landlord's overdue notice was the worst thing that could happen to them. Free to live and die and maybe even do something that the rest of them would remember for a short time, a year, a century, a civilization.<br/><br/>And on high, Olympian, the gods looked down uncaring and uncomprehending, disinterested in the organic infestation on this measly planet, set upon their own schemes and trials. None of them would take notice of this puny unevolved species. None of them but one, the one who carried their message to an insensate universe, their soul, their magician and trickster, unable to avoid noticing these creatures because they were a part of It. A meddler, a torturer, a soul lost upon the void, drowned in a sea of silence...<br/><br/>And that reminds me of a guy I know. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453277/#Comment_453277" name="Item_342" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-13T19:18:31+00:00" title="May 13, 2016  7:18PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Episode XVI: Ashes to Ashes (Deleted Post-Credits Scene)</b><br/><br/>The two women walked through the narrow corridor formed by steel packing shelves on either side. The shelves were full to bursting of wooden and cardboard boxes, many stamped with the initials LASAS and a date.<br/><br/>"It is very impressive," said one of the women. They stopped at the intersection of a traverse corridor.<br/><br/>"Thank you," said her companion. She stopped in front of a map tacked up to a cinderblock wall and lifted a pair of horn-rimmed glasses to her face. She nodded with a satisfied air and let the glasses drop back on their cord to her breast. She adjusted the long red scarf that was tightly wound around her neck and led her companion down the right hand corridor.<br/><br/>They came to a large steel door, thick as a bank vault door and with a lock as least as complex. "We have a reading room in here," said the woman with the red scarf. "And we keep a few of the more\u2026sentimental artifacts on display there."<br/><br/>They stepped through the doorway. The woman in the scarf pulled the door shut behind them and spun the lock. Her companion slowly turned, nodding at the paintings and photographs hanging from the walls. On a table in the center of the room, a diagram of a step pyramid was displayed.<br/><br/>"For me?" she said with the ghost of a smile. She was shorter than the other woman, with long, straight black hair and eyes that were black in the dim light. She had light-brown skin and carried herself with an almost royal elegance.<br/><br/>"A coincidence."<br/><br/>"Surely you know that for someone like me, there is no such thing." She turned and picked up a small leather-bound journal. "Ah, my husband\u2019s notes. I had thought them lost in the shipwreck. Ramon Echevarr\xeda\u2019s last testament to the world. Who will read it, I wonder?"<br/><br/>"Those least like to fall under its influence, I should think," said the woman with the scarf.<br/><br/>There was a vitrine against the rear wall, made of conspicuously thick glass. Mounted inside it was a dismembered human forearm. Its golden color made it look metallic. Just above the wrist, a lipless mouth full of jagged teeth slowly opened and closed, as if drugged. M\xe9rida leaned over it for a long time. "You kept it, I see," she said finally.<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"Will you not destroy it?"<br/><br/>"When the time is right. After all, it may yet prove valuable. And I secured it at no small risk."<br/><br/>"And what would your agents think of you doing this?"<br/><br/>"They were never my agents. Well, not knowingly, anyway. Let\u2019s just say that when I saw the chance to improve the situation, I did so."<br/><br/>"You always were opportunistic, Wilhelmina. I notice that one item from that affair is conspicuously missing."<br/><br/>"Whatever do you mean?"<br/><br/>"The ibis-headed dagger in your hand, Mina. Come, come, hiding it behind your back won\u2019t work on me."<br/><br/>Mina took her hand from behind her back. She was holding the Dagger of Thoth in it.<br/><br/>"So," said the other woman. "It is to be this way?"<br/><br/>"I\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t have loose ends like you running around, M\xe9rida."<br/><br/>"So I\u2019m a loose end now. Do you not think I could stop you if I wanted to?"<br/><br/>"Perhaps. Our experts took a number of precautions in constructing this room. And I am not without experience in this sort of thing."<br/><br/>M\xe9rida Echevarr\xeda ran her hand along the vitrine. "My poor Wilhelmina. You are still quite young by my standards. How will you be when you have outlived three generations of those you loved? I was loved by one who worshipped me as a goddess. I was queen over an entire people who did the same. I have lived many, many lifetimes since then. I have lived long enough to come full circle and see my own younger self growing up. But you, Mina\u2026you still think that you are human."<br/><br/>"Indeed. I see no reason to think otherwise."<br/><br/>"Don\u2019t you? Don\u2019t you grasp that to be human is to be mortal? Surely you can deduce that syllogism."<br/><br/>"I\u2019m afraid that I don\u2019t believe you were <i>ever</i> human, my dear, so I find your conclusions to be biased."<br/><br/>M\xe9rida chuckled. "Perhaps you are right. Well, come do what you came to do."<br/><br/>"I plan to."<br/><br/>There was a long silent pause.<br/><br/>"Well?" said M\xe9rida crossly. "Do it, damn you! I\u2019ve waited long enough! Go on, I want\u2014"<br/><br/>Mina drove the dagger into her chest. M\xe9rida slumped against the table, panting. For a moment she looked at Mina with eyes that were filled with both pain and gratitude. Then she collapsed to the floor.<br/><br/>Mina watched her dissolve for a while. When she was satisfied there were no more remains, she unlocked the vault and left the room.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br/><br/>Her guard detail, in their plain olive drab uniforms, met her as she climbed out of the mineshaft.<br/><br/>"Are you all right, ma\u2019am?" said her adjutant, running up to her with a parasol.<br/><br/>"Yes. The target was sanctioned with no other casualties."<br/><br/>"Very good, ma\u2019am. Shall we bring in the chopper?"<br/><br/>"Yes, young man, summon the helicopter if you please."<br/><br/>Her adjutant waved over the signals orderly. "Alert the President that the Director is leaving Groom Lake. Shall we tell Las Vegas to ready your plane, ma\u2019am?"<br/><br/>"No. Let\u2019s head out to that Institute I\u2019ve been hearing so much about. It\u2019s on our way, after all. I think it\u2019s high time we find out what trouble they\u2019ve been getting into."<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453279/#Comment_453279" name="Item_343" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-13T19:19:20+00:00" title="May 13, 2016  7:19PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And that is finally that!<br/><br/>I hope you enjoyed this accelerated finale run through.

Sometimes, casting choices help: deciding to use James Mason for Montgomery Donovan made it easier for me to find a nice supervillain rhythm. Sometimes just the accent can help: knowing that Betty was about 18 and "toiked loik dis" let me lock her into the brassy would-be action hero she became.<br/><br/>Betty also points at something: she had a motivation, to become an investigator. So when in doubt, I could hit that as an approach to her scenes. When she and Millicent began to interact, I saw right away I could have fun by contrasting Millicent's relative straight-lacedness with a party girl attitude for Betty.<br/><br/>I guess I generally try to find a hook to hang the NPCs on, then come up with a speech pattern and accent, and go to town. For example, Sir Godfrey was easy for me to play after I came up with the concept--"ruthless Templar not afraid of modern tech"--and his rather gruff but elevated tone and accent. (There were some ideas that lurked in the back of my mind with Godfrey--I had planned a reveal where it was clear that as a Templar he was in fact in favor of Echevarria's plan to destroy the universe--but I didn't get a chance to bring that out; so it's probably no longer true in-universe.)<br/><br/>Ultimately, there's a give and take. I wanted to make Betty someone Jimmy wanted to protect, but it might not have gone there. (I had my suspicions that it would work based on how you played Jimmy; but I was willing to abandon the idea if it wasn't going anywhere.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453385/#Comment_453385" name="Item_354" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-19T16:27:43+00:00" title="May 19, 2016  4:27PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Will you start a new thread for the new campaign?
