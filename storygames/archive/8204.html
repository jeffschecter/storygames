Therefore I think it\u2019s good to use point buy system, to produce \u201csupported pillar\u201d (no more skills above than below, ergo supported) and to give option to use super skills instead of normal skills. I think 20 mundane skill points and 5 super skill points are therefore good starting value. Super skill points could be used to buy mundane skill too, if you are a superhero\u2019s supporting character. <br/><br/>Example: You could have: One Great skill (4 mp), one great Super skill (4 sp), two good skills (6 mp), three fair skills (6mp) and four averages skills (4mp), and one super skill (1 sp).<br/><br/>Mundane skills and super skills are usually equal in value, but the super skills usually produce additional effects. The strongest is the \u201caugmented\u201d mundane skill; basically a mundane skill made super skill. Super athletics, or super strength are the base examples, but you could have super skill of any kind. Super skills need a associating Super stunt to start, but follow the skill advancement rules after this, using the super skill points to increase. <br/><br/>For Stunts you have mundane stunts; those stunts from the Spirit of the Century that sound mundane, and the Super stunts; those that don\u2019t sound mundane and the ones produced for the superpowers. Starting character could have two mundane stunts and four super stunts. Again; super stunts could also be mundane stunts. <br/><br/>For aspect number I use 6 aspects delivered from the characters background and one additional to represent the idea of the hero in question. This makes total of 7 aspects for the starting character. I give 6 fate points at the start of an adventure, equal number to the active aspects, maybe an additional for consequences still lingering on. <br/><br/>For collection, superpowers are represented by all three elements; skills (by super skills), stunts (by super stunts) and aspects (by ones from your background or your special superhero aspect).<br/><br/>For these, especially the stunts, I like to include elements to the system, sub-systems, that make the stunts effective. The first one is that if conflict or test is equal value, the tests \u201cconnects\u201d. Some powers have effect if the test connects; some place aspects, produce stress or similar, naturally there are also powers that prevent the effects on connect, both have the effect that you will have one more result. Usually in normal conflict the connecting result is compromise, which means that both sides gain something. What this means is a deal between the combatants, with reason. There are many conflict types, with associating super skills and stunts; so there are super speed for chases, super strength for physical, super charisma for social, super mentalist for mental and super arcane for magical.  <br/><br/>Second element is \u201cpermissions\u201d. Skills and stunts give you permission to do maneuvers to produce aspects or make declarations on subjects. This means that without weather control you can make assessments about the weather; usually working on the aspects already in scene and maybe make declarations about the future of the weather. With Super skill Weather Control you can include Aspects like \u201cfoggy\u201d, \u201cslick road\u201d and the like to the scene. What can be done by normal skill and what needs an super skill is up to GM, usually its better do have super skills for more dramatic things that work immediately and keep normal skill maneuvers mundane and effects relatively slow.   <br/><br/>From the Scale System idea from FateRPG yahoo group; vehicles, superpowers and basically anything that can be affected could have Narrative Armor (Scale), which makes it invulnerable to effects affecting subjects of lesser scale. Narrative Armor can be overcome by Tags, which now have this new option, side of the usual re-roll and +2.  If the combatant is itself greater scale, then it can\u2019t invoke it\u2019s aspects against a target that is lesser scale until after rounds in scale. In military sense this means that primary battle tank (scale 2), would need two rounds of maneuvering to target individual soldier (scale 0) with its aspects, one round to maneuver to target group (scale 1) with its aspects or target a fortification (scale 2). It would need itself use aspects to target a super heavy battle tank (scale 3). Superheroes and vehicles could have stunts, powers and features that could widen their ability to affect targets of lesser or greater scale, but most primary type is the ones that increase their individual scale. For example you could have Super skill Flight, which gives you ability to do chases by yourself, without need of vehicles. You could then have advanced versions of flight, that give you a Speed Scale bonus, which means that in dog fight you have scale advantage because of your superior speed, in addition of the other advantages the advanced stunt could give you. <br/><br/>Lastly; the stunts and skills give you ability to perform tasks that are usually impossible, miracles if you like. For example advanced item empathy gives you ability to immerse your senses to the item, giving you ability to see the past of an item. This usually allows you make new kind of maneuvers, but also include the history to your narration. Phasing skill allows you move through walls, which is basically an ability to ignore some portion of game masters narration. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question:</span> <br/>So what you think? Do you imagine other sub-systems that could inspire more superpowers? <br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>-Tonpa                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tonpa" title="Tonpa"><img alt="Tonpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://forum.rpg.net/image.php?u=29687&amp;dateline=1154034768"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tonpa">Tonpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180563/#Comment_180563" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-27T03:20:43+00:00" title="November 27, 2008  3:20AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some Superpowers for example: <br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ITEM EMPATHY</span></b><br/><b>Item Empathy Super skill [Stunt]</b><br/><br/>You Know items more personally than normal persons do, you understand them more like humans do other humans. You can use Item Empathy Super Skill to \u201dreveal\u201d aspects from the items, the same way you can do from regular persons. The skill your Item Empathy skill is connected to gives you specialization what kind of aspects you are more likely to reveal. Engineering gives deeper understanding on the worked objects, Academics about old and historical objects, Science works on base elements and forces working inside the objects, Art is more connected to the Artistic side and the social interaction the objects are to people in general. The skill in question is renamed Super Skill of the same type. For example Engineering based Item Empathy is Super Engineering.<br/><br/><b>Item History Reading [Stunt]</b><br/><br/>Prerequisite: Super Item Empathy Skill Average or greater<br/><br/>You can \u201creveal\u201d aspects from the object you are touching that tell something about it\u2019s past or you can make an declaration about the past events concerning the object. Usually this is about the strong feeling in the presence of the object or the creation process itself. This can be combined with appropriate skill conflict; like investigation, to reveal more determining clues. This is done by placing a suitable aspect to the object by maneuver, which is then used in some following conflict. The \u201crevealed\u201d aspect is so strong than anyone can make intuitive leaps about the object, even person not usually sensitive to these kinds of effects.<br/><br/><b>Item History Viewing [Stunt]</b><br/><br/>Prerequisite: Item History Reading.<br/>You can 'reveal' aspects from the object you are touching that shows something about it's past or you can make an declaration about the past events concerning the object. This is represented by a visual aspect in the scene; usually with some reflective surface projecting some images from its past. Different representation is some fine grainy substance, like sand, forming images about past event. This can be combined with appropriate skill conflict; like investigation, to reveal more determining clues. This is done by placing a suitable aspect to the object by maneuver, which is then used in some following conflict. Because the reading is supported by Visual images you have bonus 2 shifts with 'connecting' versus tests against hiding or shielded individuals. The 'revealed' aspect is so strong than anyone can make intuitive leaps about the scene, even person not usually sensitive to these kinds of effects.<br/><br/><b>Item History Immersion [Stunt]</b><br/><br/>Prerequisite: Item History Reading.<br/><br/>You can merge mentally in to the object, which history you are reading. You experience suitable sensory feeds about the objects past; therefore 'revealing' a sticky aspect which is linked to yourself by the experience or you can make a declaration about the past events concerning the object. You can think yourself as a witness of the scene itself and therefore use Alertness instead of Investigation as testing skill if you like, you can make checks with the scene as it was, instead of as it now is, to reveal more determining clues. You can be subject of mental stress because of the strong connection and if the opponent is able he can tag the aspect connecting you free; him having free foci to you.<br/><br/><b>Item Denial [Stunt]</b><br/><br/>Prerequisite: Super Item Empathy Skill Average or greater<br/><br/>You can null the 'revealed' aspects from the object you are touching. This is represented by a maneuver where you have a conflict against either the wielding person or against the 'roughness' of the object which aspect is denied. The extend of denial is delivered by the skill used; engineering usually means mechanical or electronic failures, art makes the object emotionally unattractive or even annoying, science makes flammable object unable to burn. Usually the effect lasts one scene, or to the time the opponent uses a maneuver to free the object from the denial, overcoming a block which has the strength of your Denial skill. Objects 'roughness' factor comes from the age, size and general reliability of the object. The reliability is very rough measure here; cloth is less reliably flammable than rocket fuel for example.<br/><br/><b>Item Destruction [Stunt]</b><br/><br/>Prerequisite: Super Item Empathy Skill Average or greater<br/><br/>You can work on the 'revealed' aspect to make the object to fall apart. Mechanical devices are usually made out of many parts; you can make the parts to separate and fall apart. Art objects usually have colors, materials weak against moisture and the like. More mental side is that the object could be old fashioned and out of favor. You can make an attack against the object, versus its 'roughness' value, making it suffer physical, or in some cases social stress. Objects 'roughness' factor comes from the age, size and general reliability of the object. The reliability is very rough measure here; art deco is less reliably fashionable than classic art for example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tonpa" title="Tonpa"><img alt="Tonpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://forum.rpg.net/image.php?u=29687&amp;dateline=1154034768"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tonpa">Tonpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180564/#Comment_180564" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-27T03:21:02+00:00" title="November 27, 2008  3:21AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>PHASING POWERS:</b></span><br/><b>Phasing [Endurance];</b><br/><br/>You can fit into and through spaces and shapes that no normal human readily can. You can even go through thin walls and floors, but for these you could suffer some form of stress and you leave all material behind, including clothes and tools. Normally, phasing tasks are impossible to attempt, or at best default to a (non-existent) Contortionist skill rated at Mediocre, for some minor effects. With this stunt, you can use your full Endurance score instead, and have rationale to attempt feats of contortion and true phasing that are simply unavailable to others. While you Phase you can~Rt breathe and you can only phase through unmoving stationary objects.<br/><br/>The Difficulty depends on the depth of the material you are moving through. It is easier to jump down through material than move vertically through it. While you move down horizontally you can reduce the difficulty by one. If the material has holes and cracks its even easier. If you move thought material that has opening you can reduce the difficulty by one. If there are electronic wires inside the material its harder, so increase the difficulty by one. If you fail you take minor consequence [Phase Damage] and cannot try again in the same scene.<br/><br/>Mediocre - Japanese paper walls<br/>Average - Glass windows and walls<br/>Fair - Wooden door or car window<br/>Good - Thin wooden walls or car door<br/>Great - Metal door or heavy wooden walls<br/>Superb - Brick walls and safe doors<br/>Fantastic - Stone walls and bunker doors<br/>Epic - Bunker walls and medieval stone walls<br/>Legendary - Renaissance stone walls<br/><br/><b>Phasing objects [Endurance];</b><br/><br/>Requires: Phasing.<br/><br/>You can phase objects by touching them; normally this includes clothing and tools. With Fate point you can use the Phasing skill to take another willing person with you when you phase through wall or similar object.<br/><br/><b>Phasing Attack [Endurance];</b><br/><br/>Requires: Phasing.<br/><br/>It is possibility for you to attack another person with your phasing ability, but it will be dangerous for you too. After using a Fate point you can make Endurance versus Endurance test and if you connect both you and your target take minor consequence [Phasing Damage]. If you win by three or more shifts, only the target gains the consequence. If you win by five or more shifts the target takes moderate consequence [Damaged Biology]. The target can counter the attack with fate point of his own both Fate points go to GM. No armor can protect the target, only Defensive Phasing if he has that power.<br/><br/><b>Phasing over air [Endurance];</b><br/><br/>Requires: Phasing. You can lessen your weight to be lighter than air. You don~Rt float by yourself, but you can walk over air. This cannot be done as an additional action, but takes all your concentration. You can move to elevated zones with this movement, but you must end your movement there as you catch your breath. Also you can soften your fall; all falls are treated as two categories shorter.<br/><br/><b>Defensive Phasing [Endurance];</b><br/><br/>Requires; Phasing<br/><br/>You can use the Endurance skill as active defense against physical attacks, as you let the attack pass through your body. You mast to be able to see the attack coming or otherwise be prepared to receive it. You can ready yourself for impact for additional +1 for total defense; a grand total of +3 bonus. Attacks that can harm phasing objects; like most energy attacks, ignore this ability.<br/><br/><b>Phasing through energy [Endurance];</b><br/><br/>Requires: Defensive Phasing.<br/><br/>You can use the Endurance skill as active defense against energy attacks. In addition while you phase through electronic equipment you can use your Endurance skill to attack them, short-circuiting the electronic parts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tonpa" title="Tonpa"><img alt="Tonpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://forum.rpg.net/image.php?u=29687&amp;dateline=1154034768"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tonpa">Tonpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180565/#Comment_180565" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-27T03:22:27+00:00" title="November 27, 2008  3:22AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>FLIGHT</b></span><br/><b>(Average) Flight [Stunt]</b><br/><br/>Prerequisite: Flight Super Skill Average or greater. Suitable power to which the flying ability is linked.<br/><br/>You have the ability to fly using your own power; the ability you have to control your flight is represented by super skill Flying, which most often used in chases and flying stunts, but also to carry persons to safety (restricted by your might ability). The base flight ability gives you the possibility to move to zones you would not be able to by normal land based abilities. Your flight starts by expression of your power to which the flying ability is linked, this by base is as subtle as your base power, fire based power will give out a measure of light and visual flames for example. The Flight skill gives you a ability to survive the strains of normal weather and lack of air and some measure of cold. The base stunt gives you the ability to fly as fast as land based motor vehicles do, to the upper limit including sport cars. The base skill itself is the measure how economic your flight is, and additionally how fast you speed up, so generally low skill will chase trucks, high skills will catch speeding sport cars. The height you can reach by your base ability is 1000 meters. You can use shifts to take this higher, but you endanger yourself.<br/><br/><b>Advanced (or Fair) Flight I [Stunt], [Scale 1: Speed]</b><br/><br/>Prerequisite: Flight.<br/><br/>You have better than base ability to fly. You compare to fighter plane from the Great War. Your maximum speed is something on the scale of 100 - 160 km per hour, depending how high your skill is. Your service ceiling is 3000 - 4000 meters and it takes about 15 -20 minutes to you to reach this height. You can fly dog fight with any Great War fighter, but later models are much faster than you are.

Still, there should be defensive powers that make people like Spiderman hard to hurt. In most cases superpowers should not add to the skill roll itself, that\u2019s for the aspects to do, they should modify the result of the roll. Basically you should have stunts that add armor, extra shifts, remove the \u201cconnect on ties clause\u201d, give extra stress boxes, give extra minor or moderate consequences, add new aspects on connects, make some aspects sticky etc. The basic system can be modified in quite numerous factions. Some though should be given to what is mortal stunt and what is not.  Generally speaking it defends on the superhero period you are representing. <br/><br/>Effect 1: Armor. Armor removes number of shifts after the connecting attack. Therefore it doesn\u2019t make you harder to hit, it makes you harder to drop, as long as you have stress boxes to spare. Armor is really quite and therefore I think first level is suitable for mortal stunts and mundane armor (chainmail and the like). Armor doesn\u2019t stack, therefore you could have Armor from multiple sources, and so the armor could have some other additional effects. <br/><br/>Social Glider [ Stunt - Mundane ]<br/>Prerequisite: Rapport skill fair or better. <br/>You have an Armor 1 for social conflicts that give you the ability to participate, i.e. you don\u2019t have consequence that restrains your abilities.

Scale represents the difference in potency in situational sense; for common soldiers in medieval setting a armored knight is a higher scale than he is. Group of soldiers are greater scale than lone bandit etc.  Scale can be overcome by maneuvering, but usually this means that advance is with the higher scale party. <br/><br/>Example 1: Knight of scale 2 (superior fighter) fights against small band of peasants\u2019 scale 1 (group). The band has the superiority of numbers, but this is countered by their lack of military know how. To attack the knight they must produce an edge that they can use, first tag is free as always, but later on they must use fate points to tag the aspect again, or use maneuver to produce another aspect.  For balance sake the knight can\u2019t directly attack the stress of the group in the first round; he can use it to make a declaration from his own aspects or to maneuver himself. He can naturally try to keep the peasants maneuver from succeeding, basically forming a bloc. <br/><br/>\u201cDuring his trip to examine the case of murdered sheep, Sir Lucas encounters a band of bandits on the road.\u201d <br/><br/>In this case Sir Lucas has scale 2 (because of his equipment). Bandits are scale 1. Bandits have superior numbers (+1 bonus), but Sir Lucas has chainmail (Armor 1) and superior weaponry (+2 shifts). <br/><br/>\u201cSir Lucas steers his horse in defensive manner and rises his shield up to show his emblem taunting the bandits, bandits have made effort to surround him, but no avail.\u201d<br/><br/>Bandits make an attempt to maneuver to superior position, using it to produce [Ambush!] aspect to the scene, which would counter the scale difference. Sir Lucas uses his Mounted Combat (renamed survival) skill to form a block. He uses also his aspect [Sir Lucas, lord protector of these lands] with fate point to make a declaration that these bandits are the ones behind the sheep disappearances, not necessary, but stylish. His Block value is therefore +5, Bandits maneuver is only +2.  Bandits cannot attack Sir Lucas directly. I also rule that by the spin here Sir Lucas gains a +1 to next roll. <br/><br/>Next round Sir Lucas is free to attack the bandits, who will again try to maneuver so they could attack. With some luck they could make some effect on the knight, but in general it seems that they have little hope. <br/><br/>If the combatants are generally in somewhat same scale you shouldn\u2019t use scales, but for more drastic ones they can be nice modifications to normal blocks. Generally if you have superior attack ability and superior defensive ability, you are a greater scale. Sometimes you could even use different scales for different aspects of the fight. If for example two fighters are dog fighting, you could rule that they are both scale 2 for maneuvering and defensive capacities, but only scale 1 in offensive capacity; this means that both need to succeed in maneuver to target another. If you combine this with large amount of extra shifts with guns and low defensive capacities, you could end up quite intensive fights.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>-Tonpa                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tonpa" title="Tonpa"><img alt="Tonpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://forum.rpg.net/image.php?u=29687&amp;dateline=1154034768"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tonpa">Tonpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180747/#Comment_180747" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-29T01:22:49+00:00" title="November 29, 2008  1:22AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2008 1:23AM by Tonpa.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Example 2: Helmut Frank is patrolling the field in western front with his Panzer II and small group of additional border guards, when a single Cruiser Mk II comes in sight. The Panzer has less than optimal gun for the duel, but the Cruiser fares not so much better. Both tanks have good armor. Therefore both have a defensive scale of 3, Panzer has offensive scale of 1, while the Cruiser has 2. Both use same initiative number, and therefore act at the same time. <br/><br/>\u201cHelmut makes move to take a left side of northern hill, to give himself some advantage, while he issues preliminary orders to his border guards to ready a flank action. Sir Gruel, in his Cruiser takes more offensive action and moves to cut off the Panzer from its support.\u201d <br/><br/>Helmut rolls for his maneuver, ending up with +3, which is enough to produce a maneuver for [Hillside Advantage], Sir Gruel uses his aggressive stance to maneuver a +2 to produce [Cut off] aspect to Helmut himself. <br/><br/>\u201cHelmut makes a daring dash and clashes the Cruiser with his cannon, while the hill making him able to flank his enemy, Sir Gruel makes a rough decision to attack the supporting guars, not the panzer itself. Their Opel goes up in flames, while the panzer\u2019s gun bounds the cruiser armor..\u201d<br/><br/>Helmut makes an attack using one fate point to activate his [Hit hard, Hit Fast!] and uses the free tag for the [Hillside Advantage] aspect. Therefore he has the needed shifts in the scale and makes his attack; roll is +1, with his Cannon skill (delivered from guns) good and his superior spotter giving him +1 bonus the attack is +5. Sir Gruel makes his desperate maneuverability roll, but has total of +2. This makes this +3 shifts and there are +4 shifts from his cannon.  Total of +7. Cruiser has an Advanced Armor of 3, which lessens the effect to 3 shifts, which makes the attack minor coincidence + box 2. Minor Coincidence sounds like [Dazed Crew]. Sir Gruel makes and Maneuver with total check of +4 and produces a aspect to his enemy [Shattered Group]. <br/><br/>\u201cWith some smoke rising from the Cruiser Helmut tries to make an deceitful false retreat, but now Sir Gruel makes his name really known, with defenders in disarray, he launches an brutal strike against the Nazi. With devastating effect! \u201c<br/><br/>Helmut makes an maneuver to produce a [False Retreat] aspect. Simultaneously Sir Gruel makes an attack against Helmut. He uses the free tag from [Shattered Group] to maneuver behind the Panzer,  then uses free tag from the [Cut Off] to gain +2 to his attack and also invokes [I\u2019m Gruel, Sir Real Gruel!] to add another +2. His cannon skill is good for +3, he rolls +2. His Grand total is therefore +9! Helmut uses the [Dazed Crew] to reroll abysmal roll to produce a roll of +1. His maneuver skill is fair, so his total is +3. The Cruiser cannon produce an extra +4 shifts. Panzer\u2019s armor reduces 2 from this.  Grant total is therefore 11 shifts, ouch.  Helmut takes moderate consequence [Flames in engine room] to lessen this by 4, then takes minor consequence of [Fear in the cabin] to lessen this further 2. This leaves 5. His tank has normal stress boxes of 3, but also an extra 2 boxes from a armor stunt Rough Machine. Sir Gruel\u2019s cannon has the feature to fill two extra boxes below the hit. His Panzer is still functional, but only barely. The false retreat maneuver succeeds giving a small relief to Helmut\u2019s predicament.  <br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>-Tonpa                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
