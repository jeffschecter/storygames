Perhaps a central plot emerges; people like it, take ownership of it... and try to push it in the direction THEY want.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then the story "ends". With someone getting their way, and others feeling sort of cheated or disillusioned.

Begin Plot 1<br>2. Begin Plot 2<br>3. Begin Plot 3<br>4. End Plot 3<br>5. End Plot 2<br/>6. End Plot 1<br/><br/>In other words, use editing techniques to ensure the stories end in the most satisfying order.<br/><br/>Often, it's clear what the most important story is (and it doesn't always follow the structure above). It's probably the one with most player characters invested in it. It needs to end last. Cut between scenes to ensure this.<br/><br/>We played Steal Away Jordan on Friday. In that, we had lots of plots, all drawing to a close:<br/><br/>1. Spaniel wanted to buy his freedom and was doing so by getting a better master.<br/>2. Button and Hopalong were poisoning the whole family.<br/>3. Achilles and Wellington were being blamed for the death of the youngest son.<br/><br/>Plot 1 seemed the least important, because it involved one character, separate from the others. Plot 2 seemed the most important, because it ended in the whole family dying. So I cut between scenes to ensure that they resolved in the order 1, 3, 2. Rather wonderfully, Button then decided to poison Achilles, too, drawing the last two plots together.<br/><br/>Graham                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242522/#Comment_242522" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-18T03:59:51+00:00" title="November 18, 2009  3:59AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That question is presented in the wrong order, and can't be answered without first asking why the collaborative story is told. You can see yourself how you present a scenario where people try to push the story in directions they want it to go. Controlling the presence and direction of that want is essentially what you need here; as long as everybody wants the same direction, there is no conflict, and convergence is automatic.<br/><br/>Roleplaying games (or at least the subset concerned with regulating collaborative storytelling) control the players' motivations in this regard by giving them simplified, game-like goals and responsibilities to fulfill instead of requiring aesthetic judgment of them. This ensures that the sort of conflict you describe does not emerge, as the players do not actually shape and advocate for a story outcome. A typical set-up is to have each player control a single character and advocate solely for that character's interests; this is not because the player wants the character to triumph in the story, but because this role of advocation is necessary for an exciting story to form. This sort of non-committal relationship between the player and the story taking shape allows the players to collaborate on story creation without actually taking an aesthetic stance towards what the story should be about - they just each follow their own role in the game blindly, and only enjoy the story as an audience. Because nobody is controlling the story's direction, there is no creative conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242523/#Comment_242523" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-18T04:05:26+00:00" title="November 18, 2009  4:05AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm quite interested in general discussion of this topic.

Some made up actions happen and are added to the matrix. Others fail their roll and are not added in. Bit by bit the clues point the finger to one suspect (usually one of the players).<br/><br/>I help out the players by giving them a "Plot Track" that outlines the type of actions that usually happen in such stories. In a version I'm working on now the plot track tells the players what to resolve each turn. It is more deterministic that story games might like but does make a story game more accessible to more mainstrean type gamers (I hope).<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242570/#Comment_242570" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-18T09:12:02+00:00" title="November 18, 2009  9:12AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>I'm quite interested in general discussion of this topic.

The conflict with the Witch pushes the story forward, but the real drama is about something different (the interplay between the samurai's pasts and their relationship as a group). That's one way you could deal with alien confrontation.<br/><br/>As far as your original question goes, I think there are several strategies that are commonly employed to promote convergence, depending on the structure of the game.

Then, when the session is ending, everyone signals that they are done playing by re-incorporating one of these elements. Since the game is very much build-the-plot-and-world-as-you-go, it feels quite natural, and you can get some blessedly (or cursedly) convergent endings. <br/><br/>In Under my Skin, there is always a climactic scene where everyone involved in the plot comes together at the same time.

For some, this may mean lowering their expectations for things like consistency (because 4+ people pulling a story in different directions just doesn't produce that easily, unless there's some kind of hivemind at work).  For others, it may mean deciding to elevate the joy in collaboration above anything else they like about gaming, and setting aside their own desires and ideas in order to promote someone else's.<br/><br/>Basically, you'll get the story to converge on an ending without anyone feeling unfulfilled when everyone working on the story decides that convergence on an ending is the best thing about playing and they make whatever compromises are necessary to enjoy it.  For some groups, this will require a lot more compromises than others.  (I suspect that there are people here who barely had to compromise at all in order to get there; but they're probably the exceptions rather than the rule.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242627/#Comment_242627" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-18T14:53:56+00:00" title="November 18, 2009  2:53PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, indeed.
