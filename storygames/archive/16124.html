I was thinking about this today, and recalled one particular interaction I had with a friend and fellow gamer (and pretty good GM) at ACNW.  She's also a writer.<br/><br/>I said that I struggled with conflict.  This statement took as a given that conflict is the heart of story, so it seemed important.  She said she wasn't surprised, since she knows me pretty well, knows that a lot of my real life has been about conflict avoidance (in the past) and conflict management (now) and knew that my typical approach in real life is to find common ground and attempt compassion and empathy with those I'm in conflict with. <br/><br/>Those are valuable things, even in RPGs, but mostly OOC.  But in-game...not so much.<br/><br/>So we talk a bit about that, and then she says "what I do with my characters is find out what they want, and them keep them from getting it".<br/><br/>Little lights exploded in my head.<br/><br/>Oh.  <br/><br/>Since then, which was only November of last year, I feel like I have leveled up a bit as far as gm'ing goes.  <br/><br/>Of course, this presumes a certain sort of game, one where that internal tension of not getting what your character wants is enjoyable and what the player is seeking.  Many games aren't like that.  It's the sort of game I personally like a lot though.<br/><br/>I don't know if I'm looking for reactions to the above, here, or if I'm looking for others to share their own aha! moments.  Either, I guess, would be fine.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367548/#Comment_367548" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T11:19:05+00:00" title="March 14, 2012 11:19AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd re-phrase that a touch for my own habits.<br/><br/><i>I find out what the players/characters want and put things in the way between them and it.

There are many approaches to this issue: <br/><br/>1- you could say that the GM is a fan of the players but is bound by certain rules to make their choices (good and bad) matter, insofar as mistakes and bad judgment calls will come back to bite them. but you just want to see how it all hashes out; you don't have it in for them!<br/><br/>2- you could say that the GM is trying to kill the players; that's her job. this requires, in turn, a lot more careful balancing and tweaking of GM power so that, like it says in AW, "why don't i just say there's a cave-in, and you all take 10-harm?"<br/><br/>3- you could make the players' decisions not really matter at all. whenever they threaten to kill the dragon or find the chalice too soon (in your aesthetic judgment), you just say "nah, sorry. you don't do that. wouldn't happen." in this case, you have a sort of hybrid approach, compared to the others: you aren't exactly the PCs' opponent, but you aren't really there to just see how it all turns out, either. <br/>it's just the reverse, actually - they're here to see the awesome prep you've put together. <br/>and yet, why does this approach seem to at least sort of work? it's certainly endured for 20+ years. i think it's because it does, still, maintain a disunity of interests among all participants - - the players are Chaos, always going the wrong way and killing the innkeeper and burning shit for no reason, while the GM is Order, nudging or slapping the PCs down the right corridor and making sure they get a chance to see all the cool content you made. this tension - between players' search for freedom and the GM's search for creative fulfillment - can keep groups going for a long time, provided the players don't find it annoying.<br/><br/>i do find it annoying, intensely so, which is why i prefer methods 1 and 2 FARRRR more than 3, haha<br/>yes, these approaches are roughly analogous to different creative agendas. no, it's not a sharp 1:1 relationship.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/malcolmpdx" title="malcolmpdx"><img alt="malcolmpdx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/malcolmpdx">malcolmpdx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367568/#Comment_367568" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T11:41:30+00:00" title="March 14, 2012 11:41AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>I'd re-phrase that a touch for my own habits.<br/><br/><i>I find out what the players/characters want and put things in the way between them and it.

I would rephrase that as create a situation where the character's innate needs are stressed, endangered, or questioned.  Then they can do what they will do, which may mean changing the situation, or changing themselves, or even just living in the tension and conflict for a while.

The trick seems to be a matter of trying to nudge people into achieving their ends via means that require Experience Tests. The loyal friend advocates murdering a rival instead of further negotiations, or the desperate castellan starts looking for demonic magic to end the siege, even though you told him not to. Et cetera.

There are always other ways to play, and I wasn't making a value judgement on them, other than saying that I tend to like games that are in a specific style, and one that has conflict pretty centrally located.  Luckily for me, the people I play with agree.  <br/><br/>I'm thinking the central thing here is (and in some recent discussions on this site regarding GM "rules" ) is what tools and techniques or even habits of mind are useful in running a game where people can have fun, in the way that they want to have fun, possibly even in different ways, at the same time.  <br/><br/>This can be hard.  One person wants to blow off some steam and have lots of action which is not terribly fraught with consequences.  Another wants to dig really deeply into the motivations and mindset of their character.  A third wants to have some time in the spotlight to "act".  A fourth just wants to have another beer and hang out with their friends.  I've been all these folks, at one point or another, and sometimes even in the same game.<br/><br/>It seems to me that trying to accommodate all these players at once is admirable, but possibly a fools errand.  The factor that distinguishes here is if one players fun is dependent or impacted by another's.  It's quite possible to have a very well formed group that can make space for everyone's fun, but it's been rare in my experience.  <br/><br/>Now, I mostly play these days at cons, which makes the resolution easier, in the sense that if I'm careful, I'll get people signed up who want the same thing, more or less, that I do.  That has its own set of challenges, like how to write a short game description that signals to the right sort of players for the game.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if approaching this from the top down or from the bottom up is more efficacious.  Top down would be trying to limit the sort of game from the outset, and be pretty strict about what the game is about.  That has dangers, of course.  But so does making things wide open, and trying to figure it out on the fly, which I'll call a bottom up approach.<br/><br/>So far, for a variety of reasons, I have tended towards top down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367903/#Comment_367903" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-15T12:09:10+00:00" title="March 15, 2012 12:09PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite><br/><i>I find out what the players/characters want and put things in the way between them and it.

And maybe another year or two before I could really articulate it to other people.<br/><br/>But part of that might be because I was largely happy with those ten years of gaming, and happy people have no reason to be introspective.  The old "if it ain't broke" rule applies, and you just go on doing what you're doing, without really thinking about whether it could be even better.  What changed after those ten years was that our group's gaming time got more limited by work and family obligations, and suddenly the fun-to-time-invested ratio became much more important, and we all got more interested in working out ways we could extract the most out of the 3-4 hours we could get together for.  And man, it was a watershed moment for our games; now we talk about what we're going to play, establish common ground on how the game will work and when it will be scheduled and what it will be about, we talk about whether we're getting what we want out of the PC-to-PC interactions, we evaluate whether we like how a game is going every few weeks, and all in all, I wish I'd <i>started</i> gaming with that mindset.<br/><br/>Then again, when we started, I wouldn't have had the experience and information to properly evaluate what I wanted out of a game, so it probably wouldn't have worked out so well.  That's some catch, that catch 22.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368644/#Comment_368644" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-20T13:02:29+00:00" title="March 20, 2012  1:02PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Virginia</cite>1- you could say that the GM is a fan of the players but is bound by certain rules to make their choices (good and bad) matter, insofar as mistakes and bad judgment calls will come back to bite them. but you just want to see how it all hashes out; you don't have it in for them!<br/><br/>2- you could say that the GM is trying to kill the players; that's her job. this requires, in turn, a lot more careful balancing and tweaking of GM power so that, like it says in AW, "why don't i just say there's a cave-in, and you all take 10-harm?"</blockquote>\nI'm also a fan of these two, Zac.
