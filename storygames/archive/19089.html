(Winston Churchill, 13 May 1940)</blockquote>\n<img alt="image" src="https://image.ibb.co/g6S9Jw/the_few_pic.jpg"/><br/><br/><i>It is the year 1940. Hitler\u2019s Nazi hordes have overrun Europe, torn Czechoslovakia asunder, split Poland with the Bolsheviks and, with the speed of a lightning, crushed France along with the British expeditionary force. After having evacuated Dunkirk, the Great Britain now stands alone in its fight against the monstrous regime. On the shores of northern France, Germans are already amassing vast armies and starting preparations for a sea invasion of England. <br/><br/>The pilots of the Royal Air Force fight valiantly to defend English cities and to achieve the air superiority. They face the yet to be defeated might of the Nazi war machine. If they fail, the proud Albion will crumble. The famous Battle of Britain begins. Only a few of the pilots will survive to see its end, for the losses in the ranks of young pilots are astounding.</i><br/><br/>We would like to offer you a revised version of a game originally submitted to \u201cCzech RPG Kitchen 2012 design contest " to download and try (for free of course). It is a game where players assume the roles of an RAF pilots and have to fight against Nazi superiority in the deadly dogfights in the skies. After missions, they have to live a normal life on the ground for a few hours. They go to the movies, get a few beers and have a chat with friends in a pub, occasionally make love, or just sit at home by the window, look at the sky and talk to the stars. Every morning after they have to fly off into unreal, savage world of terror in the clouds above and they know that they might not come back alive...<br/><br/>The \u201cCzech RPG Kitchen 2012 design contest " is a Czech mutation of the "GameChef design contest " which already took place for six years in Czech Republic and Slovakia. The Few was there awarded with the third place and an acknowledgment for the best-written rulebook.<br/><br/>Feel free to comment!

Two-thirds of the RAF pilots in The Battle of Britain were officers, one third being sergeants and flight sergeants. It would make sense for new characters to start out either as pilot officers or sergeants, the sergeants never progressing beyond the rank of flight sergeant. Now The Few makes it seem like the normal progression is from an NCO to an officer, while in reality most officers probably never held any NCO rank. <br/><br/>I noticed something about tailing. The rules claim "You can shoot during a fly-by but the chance to hit this way is very small. It is better to tail the opponent first to obtain a better shooting position, see below." It's not nearly always better: shooting during a fly-by is a better option if the opponent is a better pilot than you and you have a good gunnery skill. I'm talking about the rules probabilities here, not reality. <br/><br/>Also, I can't quite picture a situation where you'd want to gain altitude as opposed to doing something else. And there seems to be no advantage to being a wingman to other fighters, only bombers. This might be accurate, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/StuMc" title="StuMc"><img alt="StuMc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/StuMc">StuMc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426353/#Comment_426353" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-29T06:09:27+00:00" title="December 29, 2013  6:09AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played our first game of "The Few" earlier this evening and had quite a bit of fun. There were only 3 of us tonight but the game seems to work just fine with only a few players. I'll talk about the characters next week when we get some time to do some off mission scenes. <br/><br/>For aircraft models, we used a piece of A4 paper cut into eighths (should have done 16ths) and folded into paper darts <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> The guys made these whilst I was going over the rules and I put iron crosses on the Germans and roundels on the British planes as well as numbering the German planes to record ammo expenditure and the like. <br/><br/>We started in media res in the air on a Ranger mission over the channel. Not realising how truly deadly this game is I had them fight 2 109s and a 110 that were crossing the channel on a shipping raid. The guys were pounded into dust by the enemy quite quickly and only one of them managed to bail out and survive. <br/><br/>The options for tailing or not tailing etc worked well and really created a feeling of desperation as the decisions were made round by round as to whether to engage immediately or bide time for a better shot. <br/><br/>We didn't get time to do any after mission stuff and will do that next week when we start again and play a full session. <br/><br/>A couple of little nitpicks. The ME109 carried 55 seconds of Ammunition (this I believe included the cannon ammunition). The Spitfire carried 14 seconds. (I'm not sure about the Hurricane). <br/><br/>In general, the ME was the better plane than the Spit in all areas but tight turning. The ME should get a bonus to "getaway" rolls due to the advantage of fuel injection allowing a steep dive that a carburettor does not. ME's could escape by diving away. Spits had to wing-over in order to follow otherwise their engines would temporarily cut out. <br/><br/>The disadvantages the ME had were mainly tactical rather than to do with the machine itself. Firstly, the 109 only had enough fuel for 10 minutes over England. Most fights aren't going to last this long but counting rounds as minutes might be fun as this would force the enemy to turn tail after a point. <br/><br/>The other one was that Goering ordered that fighters should fly close escort for bombers rather than range and destroy as many enemy fighters as possible. This made destroying British fighters (and ironically actually protecting the bombers) extremely difficult. I'm not sure how you would emulate this other than to not allow German aircraft to tail British aircraft where bombers are present??<br/><br/>The advantage that the British had were mainly tactical too. The Radar system allowed for planes to get into the air early enough to easily intercept high flying enemies. Maybe British aircraft defending British soil could start with an altitude advantage as well as the advantage of going first?<br/><br/>I'd also point out that German fighters flying escort couldn't really choose to engage enemy fighters unless those fighters engaged them. Often, the heaviest German losses came on the way back to base. Because the fighters had to leave the battle so early, bombers were often attacked without the benefit of fighter cover. I think in my game, there will be quite a few unescorted bombers to shoot down during patrol missions. <br/><br/>All in all, this is a really fun game. It feels a little like "Contenders" mechanically, which is not a bad thing.

I think the system could be more fun if you could always try to shoot (the best option, along with tailing, right now) and in addition do something else, like gain altitude or serve as a wingman. Of course, balancing stuff like this is quite hard, I always get frustrated when trying to develop tactical systems.<br/><br/>Actually, in a roleplaying game I'd make the characters make non-tactical, value-related choices like this: younger pilots serving as wingmen would be strictly optimal for the flight, but would bring no personal glory and aerial victories for the wingmen. So there would be a tasty conflict between the group and the individual. Also, you already kind of have the turning back option, which is safer for the pilot, but it may also mean letting his flight down. Just things that popped in my head. \n<blockquote>That is simplification on our side - as you write, most of the officers started in officer rank (all those with university degree were automatically promoted to officer rank for example)... but as really more than third of pilot were NCO\xb4s, we set the starting rank as Sgt. to make it easier.

So, I think Officer/NCO status should be a player choice. Is the squadron all hard-working NCOs? College kids just signed up? Some mix?<br/><br/>I will note in passing that the RAF had the rank of Warrant Officer for NCOs who needed to be able to command officers/other NCOs; that probably solves the issue of promoting PCs who start as NCOs.<br/><br/>Actually, you already have the natural division of "rank" in the game--the kill count. Making Ace was a Big Deal, and double-Ace on up was an even bigger deal. Maybe you can use that as the break points? (You already do now, with the Ace/DSC/DSO awards). Perhaps the PC with the highest kill count after each mission gets an extra XP? (Or divide it, like highest for a mission vs highest overall each getting a bennie.) And maybe then you could even let PCs start with some kills, maybe trading Debt for experience.<br/><br/>(You might want to also consider giving XP for whether the mission was a success, or half-kills for assists, if you want to avoid having all the PCs suddenly hot-dogging it. Or hell, just award it for number of missions flown with maybe a bonus for combat kills--the debt spiral will ensure that the more missions you fly, the closer you are to buying it :-) )<br/><br/>I think I might also let the GM assign decorations as she saw fit, based on mission performance, with maybe "bucking for decoration/going to bat for my wingman" as a possible base scene. (Does your toff CO refuse to decorate working class blokes? Or does he disdain those Oxbridge aristos? Or, even better, does he refuse to promote/decorate people from the wrong university/college/house?)<br/><br/>But these are tweaks.

But I tried to keep this quite vague so that each game can develop the way the player group wants it to - if you want something more like Heavy Gear or Neon Genesis Evangelion, your battles would be all on the ground; if you are more inspired by Macross or Gundam, then space is the place. <br/><br/>(I now realise the description of "bombers" suggests they are only spacecraft. Maybe I should rename them to "behemoths" or something.)\n<blockquote><br/>- The Few is quite deadly - did you maintained the death rate of pilots and so a bit uneasy atmosphere of struggle against superior odds... or have you changed it and have more pulp-ish atmosphere?</blockquote>\nI kept the original level of deadliness.

For you can be interesting the fact that three German squadrons which were part of the Battle of Britain, were moved to North Africa and participated in siege (so your pilots can meet some old enemies in the dunes of Africa).<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.constable.ca/caah/spits417.jpg"/><br/><br/>First idea is to replace Spitfire with/add Kittyhawk (apart from Hurricane the main interceptor in North Africa before Spitfires got dust filters and were able to flight there), add new planes - Italian MC 200s and MC 202s, SM.79 bombers and German Bf 109F and Stukas. Possibility is also to include "obsolete" planes like Gloster Gladiator or Fiat CR.42, which fly fine and fight other "obsolete" planes, but face serious penalties when fighting modern aircrafts. \n<blockquote>I have created stats for the Do 17 , and Ju 87 , as they played a part in the Battle of Britain.

(If the RAF in WW2 was like any other bureaucracy / military organization then rank has little to do with skill. ) And am using the following advancement rules:<br/>-Surviving a play session rewards the character with 1 ability point. <br/>-Every 5 kills awards an ability point. <br/>-Damaging any aircraft counts as an assist. 2 assist equal 1 kill for ability point purposes. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ecthelion" title="Ecthelion"><img alt="Ecthelion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/725/nSOWTUWM8G2D0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ecthelion">Ecthelion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428257/#Comment_428257" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-12T14:55:05+00:00" title="February 12, 2014  2:55PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>MightyScoop:</b> Superb!<br/><br/>- Dornier is lovely, no problems there.<br/>- Stuka was extremly vulnerable against enemy interceptors and above England suffered heavy casualties. It was slow, with poor maneuverability and poor defenzive weaponry (only one machine gun at the back). On the other hand as dive bomber it was terribly effective.<br/><br/>So I think it would be plane with damage points like interceptor, not like bomber (only 2 points) and tail machine gun (Perhaps only against those who tail a Stuka? It is not so effective as multiple machineguns of bombers?). <br/>"No AA bonus to straight approach ground attack." - lovely! It explains the effectivity of the dive bombing.<br/> "-2 to piloting rolls." - absolutely.<br/><br/>I think there will be Dornier and Stuka in North Africa add-on. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> Thank you very much for sharing!<br/><br/>- Separation of rank and advancement is also interesting.

Fuel / Range limitations <br/>2. Some mechanism to simulate the difficulty of locating and intercepting targets. <br/><br/>During the Battle of Britain , Dowdings system and the British radar network allowed the RAF to put fighters where they needed to be, when they were needed. This translates into "The Few" games being direct action. The GM can narrate the situation, we can easily accept that combat is likely. In the Desert and the Med, air forces did not benefit from extensive intelligence. Is it worth while to try to use this as a way to differentiate the games?<br/> <br/>As an example of spotting/intercepting situations that the rules do not cover, in one of my Battle of Britain games several He 111's fled combat. The players wanted to attempt to track/chase them. I allowed a Soldiering roll vs 16, to spot them, then an opposed Piloting roll to intercept. <br/><br/>I have also allowed opposed Soldiering rolls by the Flight Leaders to determine initiative in the beginning of combat (which commander was able to get his formations into a more advantageous position.) Predefined scenarios mitigate the need for this and perhaps that is what you have in mind already. <br/><br/>Regarding fuel , again defined scenarios might explicitly state you have X rounds of combat before you must head back to base.  <br/><br/>I'm just brainstorming here, the game is good as is. It's elegance is what makes it appealing, more "rules" may upset that balance.  <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ecthelion" title="Ecthelion"><img alt="Ecthelion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/725/nSOWTUWM8G2D0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ecthelion">Ecthelion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429180/#Comment_429180" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-06T13:07:44+00:00" title="March  6, 2014  1:07PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Biest:</b> Yep.

So we are not really sure if to add them or not...<br/><br/>About the finding of enemies... it is important and interesting thing, we should also reflect it somehow. I see problem int he point that if you don\xb4t find the enemies... than you return back on base and nothing happened. If that happens three times in a row, well... it sucks.

The English are very proud of resisting Hitler (which, in a way, contributes to national reluctance to get involved in European politics - we didn't join the European Union until the 70s). Apparently Hitler was very proud of occupying the Channel Islands which technically meant he'd occupied the territory of the United Kingdom and fortified them heavily. If you go to Jersey and Guernsey today you can still see the coastal defences and bunker network built in the early years of the war by forced Slavic labour. The British government offered the Islanders chance to flee to the mainland around the time of Dunkirk but many only sent children and their elderly, choosing instead to stay in their homes and suffer their occupation with as much dignity as possible. Reportedly some Island men conducted clandestine operations to interrupt Nazi mail from the Island - there were stacks and stack of stolen letters home to Germany hidden in cellars. <br/><br/>What makes the Battle of Britain interesting is that it's one of the few modern conflicts on which civilian population could spectate without being in immediate danger: the buzz of engines high above, inter-crossing vapour trails and smoke as "the Few" fought vicious aerial combat against endless German planes must've been an intense experience. <br/><br/>In reality the British Government didn't have much planned in case the Germans landed and certainly couldn't have conceived of a mass mobilisation of the population or a "Scorched Earth" policy like the Soviets. If the Battle of Britain had gone in favour of Germany then the South East would have been occupied and its largely unevacuated population would have fallen into German hands. True, the bridges were rigged to blow, the signposts had been taken out, passes in the hills had a token pillbox or two, a resistance network was being trained and there were tank traps outside Number 10 but it's understood that without the pilots of the RAF the Fortress Island would have succumb quickly. <br/><br/>There's an alternative timeline here where the PCs in The Few fail and the South East is invaded and the British Government in Exile and the Americans lunch D-Day from Northern Ireland, landing in Liverpool, Bristol and Wales with what's left of the RAF assisting the Yanks in the skies over Cardiff.<br/><br/>Oh, Americans! That reminds me, the social structure and number of vulnerable civilians of the South East changes as the war draws on. Many were moved out of the area as sensitive D-Day perpetrations where made and vast numbers of GIs had to be housed. As your campaign in The Few wears on you should consider adding more and more American soldiers on the ground and even pilots. The GIs were totally Alien to the rural British and cultures clashed often, even in the Armed Forces at every rank. As is characteristic of the Americans, they wanted to do things their way and not take instruction from their allies and hosts, especially not civilians. They disregarded speed limits, forgot to shut country gates, littered and walked on the grass! British feathers were thoroughly ruffled. I've been told that the British introduced the toothbrush to America through the GIs but I don't think this is true. <br/><br/>Let me know if these musings are interesting, there's more.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ecthelion" title="Ecthelion"><img alt="Ecthelion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/725/nSOWTUWM8G2D0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ecthelion">Ecthelion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429200/#Comment_429200" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-07T05:52:57+00:00" title="March  7, 2014  5:52AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 7, 2014 6:34AM by Ecthelion.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>occupied England</blockquote>\nOMG, what bullshit have I written?!

German players were from Germany, as were half of the umpires - General Adolf Galland (air), Admiral Friedrich Ruge (naval) and General Heinrich Trettner (land) - second half of players and umpires were British - Air Chief Marshal Christopher Foxley-Norris (Air), Rear Admiral Teddy Gueritz (naval) and Major General Glyn Gilbert (land). All were participants of Battle of Britain or Normandy landings (and Adolf Galland was German fighter ace of aces), plus they were using meteorological data never before published (so they were unknown to players). Of course it was only game, but the decision of umpires was unanimous - devastating defeat for the German invasion force. Take a look at the link, it is basically a battle report form wargame... but very interesting.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429206/#Comment_429206" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-07T10:25:38+00:00" title="March  7, 2014 10:25AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, I have seen this!

After that it was only matter of time, before invasion army ran out of supplies. But British Navy in game didn\xb4t even used their battleships and carriers (British players kept those in reserve).\n<blockquote>Either way it must be recognised that without the sacrifice of the Few, the Many would have suffered terribly (which, incidentally, would be a great title for a supplement detailing Civilian and Military NPCs and relationship maps - <i>The Many</i>) - the way <i>Mouseguard</i> has a "what you fight for" section).</blockquote>\n<i>I like it.</i> A lot.

The mission, code named Force Benedict, was initiated to defend the port of Murmansk which was the country's only port not under Nazi occupation. RAF Wing 151 - comprising 81 and 154 Squadrons - had a range of objectives which included teaching Russian pilots to fly Hurricanes, escorting Russian bombers over German lines and flying numerous patrols against the Luftwaffe.

Little by little, the squadrons in Africa were equipped by this new plane. They were issued preferably to squadron leaders.

It always fires all weapons, regardless if it is tailing someone or not. When it hits something, roll a single six-sided dice.

They are planing to use rules to recreate battles of X-Wings and TIE Fighters, while players are playing characters of rebel pilots in their fight againt evil Empire (sort of Rogue Squadron campaign). <br/><br/>X-Wings will have deflector shields, so they will endure more damage and pilots will be more likely to survive missions (little bit more \u201epulp\u201c and slightly less grim atmosphere than WW2) and guys are thinking about adding astromech, who would be able to help pilots with tasks (they will be for example capable of computing hyperspace jumps, so pilot can fight with X-Wing right until the jump and escape from battle\u2026 or repairing knocked down shields, helping with piloting or shooting in form of bonuses\u2026 so kinda little minigame). We will see, it sounds interesting enough. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19089/the-few-game-about-battle-of-britain" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19089/the-few-game-about-battle-of-britain" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19089/the-few-game-about-battle-of-britain/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19089/the-few-game-about-battle-of-britain/p3" rel="next">3</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19089/the-few-game-about-battle-of-britain/p3" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F19089%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F19089%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[The Few] Game about Battle of Britain - Page 3 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19089/the-few-game-about-battle-of-britain/p3" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="[The Few] Game about Battle of Britain - Page 3" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19089/the-few-game-about-battle-of-britain/p3" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="It seems so obvious now that someone has said it!

It is a good occasion to share what I am working on right now \u2013 it is a new add-on and campaign for The Few. \n<blockquote><i><b>Flying Tigers / \u98db\u864e\u968a</b><br/>"This was the beginning of the greatest adventure I would ever hope to experience. It wasn't until years later that I fully realized the magnitude and significance of this first step, to be a lifelong adventure in the mystic Far East." Erik Shilling, 3rd Squadron AVG<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3ZpEQMNQjYY/U7G9Hw52zGI/AAAAAAAAJhY/e662lgIoH-c/s1600/The+Flying+Tigers+over+China,+1942.jpg"/><br/><br/>This add-on for the game The Few will bring you the option of plaing as a member of Flying Tigers unit, one of brave pilots fighting on the skies of Far East against Japanese invasion army. You can find here a new enemy \u2013 Japanese Imperial Army Airforce, new airplanes that were flying in Burma and south China theatres, new missions organised in form of story campaign, new setting and new stories for your pilots.<br/><br/>1st American Volunteer Group (AVG), known as \u201eFlying Tigers\u201c (\u201ef\u0113i hu du\xec\u201c in Chinese) was composed of American fighter pilots, who with silent approval of an American government fought as members of Chinese airforce against Japanese agression. One hundred fighter pilots were organized in three squadrons (1st Squadron \u201eAdam &amp; Eves\u201c, 2nd Squadron \u201ePanda Bears\u201c and 3rd Squadron \u201eHell's Angels\u201c) and were flying on american-built P-40 fighters with shark mouths painted on plane noses. They joined the fight 14 days after Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and under command of colonel Chennault became famous during defence of Burma and southern China. Flying Tigers fought almost always against overwhelming odds, but during seven months of combat, they managed to destroy 293 enemy planes for price of 14 own pilots lost during missions. AVG was dissolved 4th of July 1942 after finishing their one-year contract. It was replaced by 23rd Fighter Group of United States Army Air Forces, which retained shark teeth nose art of their predecessors. <br/></i></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V" title="Tore_V"><img alt="Tore_V" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V">Tore_V</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458796/#Comment_458796" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-22T12:38:48+00:00" title="December 22, 2016 12:38PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very new to the thread, and I'll admit I've yet to read the game (dropbox is blocked at work), but even reading these threads gave me ideas for a black box or parlour larp about pilots and their families.

It has grown from the original rules to supplement African Sky, Amongst the Many, Ground Fight (guys from Slovakia are using the rules for a ground combat) and now possibly also Flying Tigers and maybe also Star Wars (with Rogue One out, some guys thought about playing and basic rules for this supplement are also finished)\u2026 so I believe it is time to create some site, where to put all the material. \n<blockquote>Did you ever have a go at a mechanic that means that the German Fighters may need to break for home before the fight is done due to fuel restrictions? </blockquote>\nI sometimes (especially when there was battle over London) used the rule that after third or fourth turn, German fighters started to roll a dice if they need to turn back (they had to turn back on roll 6 the first turn it was tested, 5-6 on second and so on).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ecthelion" title="Ecthelion"><img alt="Ecthelion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/725/nSOWTUWM8G2D0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ecthelion">Ecthelion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461080/#Comment_461080" name="Item_114" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-10T19:57:00+00:00" title="March 10, 2017  7:57PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So far was unfortunately no time to create some kind of homepage for the game (but we absolutely need to do that).
