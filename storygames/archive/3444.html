For those who missed it, snippet 1:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MikeRM</cite><br/><br/>Scene: a landing deck in Gulfhead. An elvish airship has just tied up, and two elves have disembarked. They hail a passer-by in Elvish:<br/><br/>"Hey, you, where can we get food around here?"<br/>The passer-by, who doesn't speak Elvish, says, "Sorry, I don't speak elvish."<br/>"Bloody wog," says one elf to the other, then, slowly and loudly, in pidgin Elvish: "We wantee eatee, you fella show where?"<br/><br/>And so forth.</blockquote>\n(I may rewrite that as part of the testimony of a talking cat as to why the elves ended up at a bar where they were beaten up.)<br/><br/>I'd like to post a few snippets here for quick critique so I can improve my approach to this. Too uniform in voice? Not believable enough? Too dry? Too wordy? Something else you don't like? Tell me, so I can fix.<br/><br/>Here's snippet 2:<br/><br/>From Colinal Tlit's <i>Dwarvish for Diplomats</i>:<br/><br/>One cannot stress sufficiently how important it is to <i>think </i>in Dwarvish, not merely translate mentally word-for-word. No stronger example of this can be seen than the distinction between <i>gh'sh</i> and <i>mrr</i>.<br/><br/>If you look at many abridged dictionaries, they will tell you that <i>gh'sh</i> indicates <i>craft</i>, while <i>mrr</i> signifies <i>work</i>. However, the distinction in Dwarvish is not the same as the distinction between those two words in Peqtal. In Dwarvish, <i>gh'sh</i> is what dwarves do; <i>mrr</i> is what gnomes do.<br/><br/>If one may be permitted an autobiographical moment, the present writer had this unforgettably brought home to him while serving as a junior assistant to the great Lord Pleks-Nujm on one of his many visits to the Highcrafthall Pevellen. He was incautious enough to describe a newly unveiled section of the bas-relief on the central stairway as <i>mrr g'dl</i>, by which he intended to convey "wonderful work".<br/><br/>There was a sudden silence, and then Lord Pleks-Nujm, who spoke Dwarvish more fluently perhaps than any man before or since, rescued the situation as best he could by saying, "My apprentice has not as yet mastered wordcraft. He will be disciplined as is proper to an apprentice."<br/><br/>More literally, he said:<br/><br/>Deficiency by-apprentice(pertaining-to-speaker) of-wordcraft has-made-as-yet [incompletive aspect]. To-apprentice discipline of-apprentices shall-be-as-ought [future promissory, ethical mood].<br/><b><br/>Exercise:</b> Translate Lord Pleks-Nujm's words into Dwarvish. For notes on the incompletive aspect, see p. 237, and for the ethical mood see p. 108.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77843/#Comment_77843" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-26T12:32:21+00:00" title="June 26, 2007 12:32PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like this kind of stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
