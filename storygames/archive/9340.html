The American Myths like Paul Bunyan, Pecos Bill, John Henry.  He's all excited about it right now.  I remember being caught by Paul Bunyan when I was a kid.  So, he's telling me each of the stories and then he says "Dad!  I figured out how they make Tall Tales!".  I'm kinda paying attention, kinda not.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Ok, dad.  So, pick a character."  Course I perk up when I hear that last word.  He's played WOW, and we played this Harry Potter freeform story thingy, so he's aware of the Character concept, but he's go no other basis for this.<br/>\n<br/>\n"What kind of character?" I asked amused.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Whatever dad.  Just make something up."  He's kinda annoyed that I even have to ask.  That makes me smile.  I'm rapt now.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Ok, so how about a Priest in a Spanish Mission."<br/>\n<br/>\n"Um...ok."  He's not too sure what that concept is, but rolls with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n"So, think of a Natural Disaster," he says.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Like an earthquake or a flood?"<br/>\n<br/>\n"Hmm.  Could be.  Something bad that can happen."<br/>\n<br/>\n"You mean like a complication?"<br/>\n<br/>\n"Yes! Exactly!"<br/>\n<br/>\n"Wanna give me an example?"  It's clear to me that he is itching to anyway, so I give in to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n"So, this HUGE snake attacks him!  What does he do?"  I'm cool with the giant snake.  Not really tied to anything, but works for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Ok, so the priest attacks it with a huge metal cross."<br/>\n<br/>\n"Nope.  He's so big it doesn't hurt it."<br/>\n<br/>\n"Then the priest tries to drown it in the fountain outside the mission."<br/>\n<br/>\n"Nope.  He drinks all the water."<br/>\n<br/>\n"Interesting.  The priest then jumps off the top of the roof of the mission on his neck and rides him out of there."<br/>\n<br/>\nHe laughs at that thought.  "Nope. The snake bucks him off."  I can see this going on all night (remember, he's seven).  So, I try to feel out the rule for when something will work.<br/>\n<br/>\n"What does the priest do, Jake?"  I ask him back.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Of course he grabs a rope and lassos around the snake's fangs and pulls them out one by one!"  He beams.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Cool!" I say.  That is apparently the resolution mechanic to Jake.  If one person says \u201cCool!\u201d then it works.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Then what?" he says.  "How does it end?"<br/>\n<br/>\n"He feeds the sleepy town below for a year on the flesh of the snake."<br/>\n<br/>\n"Cool." he says.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe go again (short version this time):<br/>\n<br/>\nMe: Indian chief who is worried because all of the buffalo have left and they have no food.<br/>\nJake: what does he do?<br/>\nMe: He sneaks around to scare them toward the camp.<br/>\nJake: They charge him and run away.<br/>\nMe: He plants grain in the field near the camp and hopes the smell of it entices the buffalo.<br/>\nJake: They can't smell it that far away.<br/>\nMe: The chief talks to the head bull.<br/>\nJake: The buffalo is...suspicious! (He gets excited when he uses big words).<br/>\nMe: So, what does he do?<br/>\nJake: He takes some food to the buffalo and leads them back.<br/>\nMe: They lose interest on the way. (roles switched)<br/>\nJake: Hmm...<br/>\nMe: He dresses up in a buffalo skin and leads them back as one of their own.<br/>\nJake: Cool!  Then how does it end?<br/>\nMe: He feeds his tribe, but must respect the buffalo as they trusted him enough to come back.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, here is the short story game that my son and I play.  I'm sure it will evolve over time, as they always do, but I love it in its purest moment.  We laughed and played for 2 hours this way.  It doesn't quite have the Ritual Phrase impact of Polaris, but I love that Jake made the phrases part of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTall Tales by Jacob Battle (edited by his dad)<br/>\n<br/>\n1. One player comes up with a character.  If the character doesn't have an inherent period he lives in, you have to come up with that too (his rule).<br/>\n2. One player (can be any player) comes up with a complication.  Apparently it doesn't have to relate to the character or period, but probably good to tie that in if you can.<br/>\n3. One player suggests a solution to the complication.  Any other player can resolve the solution by saying:<br/>\n"Nope."  And that means it fails, but the person has to tell why.<br/>\n"Cool!"  And that means it succeeds.<br/>\n4. Play continues until the complication is resolved by a "Cool!" statement.<br/>\n5. Then one player comes up with the ending based on what is the result of solving the conflict.<br/>\n6. The last player ends the Tall Tale with the ritual phrase "Cool."                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207073/#Comment_207073" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-13T08:36:37+00:00" title="May 13, 2009  8:36AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's genius.
