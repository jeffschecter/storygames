Please follow them:<br/><br/>1) Only one post to this thread per user. Make it count.<br/>2) Your post should quote a single paragraph of text from a roleplaying game, identifying the source.<br/>3) Your post should include nothing other than this.<br/>4) The paragraph you quote should be the one that most influenced you and your games. Maybe it was the one thing that suddenly made everything else "click". Maybe it opened you up to another way. Maybe it sold you on a particular game. Maybe it was something else. Do <i>not</i> explain your reasoning for why this paragraph and not another. (And, yes, you likely have a few such paragraphs. You only get to pick one.)<br/>5) No extraneous discussion in this thread. If you want to make comments or explain yourself better, do it in another thread.<br/><br/>Example:\n<blockquote>Sadly, traditional RPGs have long been in league with realism. They penalize players who want to, say, kick seven mooks with one spin kick by piling negative modifiers onto their roll, which makes them less likely to succeed. The inevitable result is that smart players stick to simple, boring actions and take a tactical approach to combat. Wushu breaks up this insidious alliance with a core mechanic that rewards players for vivid descriptions and over-the-top stunts by making them more likely to succeed, each and every time.<br/><div>-- <i>Wushu Open</i>, Daniel Bayn</div></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy" title="DeBracy"><img alt="DeBracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nTIWP6SSS5BV3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy">DeBracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345705/#Comment_345705" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-12T15:09:37+00:00" title="October 12, 2011  3:09PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 12, 2011 3:10PM by DeBracy.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You are sure to encounter situations not covered by these rules.

Bolts and rays such as lightning bolts, cones of cold, and even magic missiles are useless against it . . . also immune to all heat and fire, and it regenerates lost hit points at a rate of 1 hit point per round. Only enchanted weapons (+1 or better) have any hope of harming the tarrasque. The Tarrasque is totally immune to all psionics. <br/><br/>. . . Once every decade or so, the monster is particularly active, staying awake for several months. Thereafter its period of dormancy is 4d4 years unless disturbed . . .<br/><br/><b>Ecology:</b> Slaying of the tarrasque is said to be possible only if the monster is reduced to -30 or fewer hit points and a <i>wish</i> is then used. Otherwise, even the slightest piece of the tarrasque can regenerate and restore the monster completely. Legend says that a great treasure can be extracted from the tarrasque's carapace. The upper portion, treated with acid and then heated in a furnace, is thought to yield gems (10d10 diamonds of 1,000 gp base value each). The underbelly material, mixed with the creature's blood and adamantite, is said to produce a metal that can be forged by master dwarven blacksmiths into 1d4 shields of +5 enchantment.

They taught me that you can still portray a vibrant, living world in which awesome shit can happen without six composition notebooks worth of notes, opposition, and mechanics. Most importantly, these bits of advice taught me to root for my characters and look forward to all the crazy shit they inevitably end up doing.<br/><br/>How was I even operating prior to these games? I have no idea.
