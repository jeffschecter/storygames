I expect there to be a about a 40/60 split between the two things. That doesn't mean that every session will have that ratio but rather the ratio should hold up over the course of the whole game. Some sessions might be 90% dungeon crawling while another session might be 90% social interaction outside the dungeon or with denizens of said dungeon. Hopefully this kind of game appeals to you. If not, let's talk about it.<br/><br/>I'd like people to post their ideas about characters they are wanting to play. What I'd especially like is for you as players to connect your characters together in a way that makes sense. Why are they traveling into the Stoneheart Dungeon? I can't see them as a collection of strangers who just happened to bump into each other and say, "Whoa! Let's go dungeon delving!" So, how do they know each other and why are they doing what they're doing? Which brings us to setting....<br/><br/>It makes it easier on you guys to come up with cool things to do and reasons for doing them if you have some setting elements to hang your ideas on. I'm going to give you some of those. Please, if you have any ideas that go beyond the ones I list, feel free to express them. The setting as it stands right now is sketchy and only a loose framework to get you started. I'd like to see the setting really develop during play with most of it coming from the ideas of the players.<br/><br/><b>Setting Elements</b><br/><br/>    * Abysthor, High Priest of Thyr - Received a vision from his god and disappeared into the Stoneheart Dungeon some 15 years ago.<br/>    * Thyr - God of Justice<br/>    * Muir - Goddess of Virtue (Paladins)<br/>    * The worship of Thyr and Muir have slowly decline over the last decades. They have lost followers to the newer gods who are not quite so strict in their worship requirements. The Stoneheart Dungeon used to be a burial place for their heroic dead but with the decline of their sects, the place has fallen into corruption.<br/>    * The tomb of Alaric, Paladin of Muir - A long dead hero with his tomb located somewhere in the Stoneheart Dungeon.<br/>    * A tribe of Gnolls - There is a tribe of Gnolls living in the area of the Stoneheart Dungeon somewhere.<br/>    * A young dragon - A young dragon has been spotted in recent years and has probably established a lair nearby.<br/>    * A beholder - Rumors of a beholder lairing in the area have cropped up lately.<br/>    * Cult of Orcus - Evil followers of the demonlord of the Undead have taken up residence in the Stoneheart Dungeon and are desecrating the burial sites located there.<br/>    * The city of Bard's Gate is concerned about the increased activity of monsters and evil men in the vicinity of the Stoneheart Dungeon. The location is only a day or so travel away in the nearby Valley of the Shrines in the Stoneheart Mountains. This kind of activity rarely bodes well.<br/><br/>Other than these things, the setting is fairly wide open. Feel free to add stuff or expand things already listed.<br/><br/>Characters should be made with the Standard Point Buy system with 28 points. All characters should start at an Effective Character Level of 2 and should have the standard wealth of characters at that level, which is 900 gold pieces. You can have any items that you can afford with 900 gold that are listed in the DMG. I am not banning any sourcebooks. However, if you have a race or class you'd like to play that isn't listed in the PHB or DMG, then you need to ask me about it. I'm fairly easy going about that kind of thing as long as it isn't too bizarre/powerful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_116201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116201/#Comment_116201" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-24T10:57:55+00:00" title="December 24, 2007 10:57AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 24, 2007 11:18AM by Gaerik.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Houserule - Drives &amp; Conviction<br/><br/>Drives</b><br/><br/>Player Characters each choose 4 Drives. At least one of your Drives must deal directly with another Player Character whose player is at the table. Drives change over time; you will have many opportunities to change and redefine your character's Drives over the life of the campaign.<br/><br/>Drives define your character's motivations and connections to other individuals. These are the things that are most important to the character, and they help the other players understand your character. The GM will also use them to create situations that are relevant to your character.<br/><br/>Make sure your characters\u2019 drives relate to other characters (both those of other players and those taken by the GM) and to the overall theme of the game. Drives are the first and biggest input into a session, so this is absolutely essential to a good game.<br/><br/>Drives are the most powerful tool both you and the GM can use to tie your character into the story. You should make sure that at least one (or better, two) of your character\u2019s drives relate to another player character or to the main plotline of the game (this last must be done with the group\u2019s help, of course).<br/><br/>You may choose multiple Drives of the same type.  <br/><br/>A character's Drives should come from this list.<br/><br/><b>Duty</b>: A duty is something that your character feels obligated to do, for whatever reason, but does not truly enjoy. \u201cMust\u201d is a great word to describe a duty. Examples: I must take care of my friends; I must never let my brother down.<br/><br/><b>Hate</b>: A hate motivates your character through his loathing and longing to destroy something or someone. Your character will do what he can to harm, hinder, or otherwise damage the object of his hate. This attack need not be overt, by any means - one could hate an organization and infiltrate them to undermine their operations from within, or be a false friend to your enemy's son. Examples: I must destroy the vampire that killed my wife, I will bring down the corrupt city watch, I will get even with King Adstone.<br/><br/><b>Love</b>: A love is someone or something that your character cares deeply about. Your character will willingly make sacrifices on behalf of her love, and will help and protect the object of her love. Of course, just because you love something doesn\u2019t mean it loves you back. Love can also inspire jealousy. Love can be directed at an individual, a group, an activity, some abstract concept (art, for example), one\u2019s self, etc. Examples: Bahamut is my reason for living and I live to serve his divine order; there is no higher calling than to see what's over the next horizon; I would follow our commander to the ends of the earth; My land is a place worth fighting for.<br/><br/><b>Atonement</b>: Your character has done something very bad and now works to help others so he or she might be redeemed. This Drive can bring the character's motives into question - are they still working for the good or have they gone back to their old ways?<br/><br/><b>Dream</b>: Dreams are long-term goals with many steps and possibilities along the way. The player of a character with a Dream should also think about what would happen if the dream was fulfilled, or if they were forced to abandon the Dream.<br/><br/><b>Fate</b>: A Fate is the most unusual Drive from a player's perspective, because it motivates the player and often not the character. A character who is always getting into trouble despite his best efforts has a Fate. A character who does good despite his instincts because he is put in situations where his morals come out is also driven by Fate. Having a fate means players will try to find ways drive their character towards the Fate even if the character themselves drive away from them.<br/><br/><b>Fear</b>: A fear is something that terrifies your character and motivates her quite strongly out of aversion. Examples: I never want to split the party; I am terrified of enchanters and the danger of being mind-controlled; I will do whatever it takes to keep Gondor from facing war; I don't want to ever be sober; I need to be in control.<br/><br/><b>Self-Destruction</b>: A character with this drive is having trouble coming to terms with some part of themselves. This may have to do with their social status, race, class, appearance, past, or emotions. Regardless, the character puts themselves in harm's way and sometimes burns bridges.<br/><br/><b>Self-Worth</b>: For this character self-worth is a real battle. This can work well for characters that start in a "sidekick" role, unsure of how they contribute to the group.<br/><br/><b>Temptation</b>: This character walks a fine line, constantly tempted by something that's pretty much universally considered bad, such as a violent temper, abuse of power, drugs, gambling, and so on. The character struggles against this temptation but can't be completely removed from it.<br/><br/><b>Conviction and XP:</b><br/><br/>After a Scene check the Session sheet. For each Drive on the Session sheet that was addressed in that scene, award each character in the group 1 Conviction point and 100XP. <br/><br/><b>Uses of Conviction:<br/>Pts  Effect</b><br/>1:    Roll twice, take the best result (declare before roll)<br/>1:    Re-roll any die (declare after roll)<br/>1:    Take an extra move-equiv action on your turn<br/>1:    Get 1 more use of a x/day ability (including spell slots).<br/>1:    Change an existing Drive.<br/>2:    Take an extra standard action on your turn.<br/><br/>You can also use a Conviction Point to establish a small fact about the setting.  If you need 50' of rope and forgot to buy it in town, spend a point and have the rope.  Want to know a barmaid in the next tavern?  Spend a point.  Spending points in this way cannot allow you to bypass an obstacle or challenge but can give you a bonus by having the correct equipment or there being something advantageous in the environment around.<br/><br/><i>Edited:  Corrected the method for gaining conviction and XP.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116210/#Comment_116210" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-24T11:26:49+00:00" title="December 24, 2007 11:26AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, here's my 3 favs in order:<br/><br/>1) Cholodny the colorful barbarian (fighter role)<br/>2) Scythe, the Warlock and son of Abysthor (thief role)<br/>3) Meeg, the many-blooded Sorcerer (wizard role)<br/><br/>Can you guys do your favs in order so we can make sure we cover the essential roles?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_116213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116213/#Comment_116213" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-24T11:38:47+00:00" title="December 24, 2007 11:38AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 24, 2007 11:45AM by Wolfe.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting addition! I'm already feeling a couple of them for my Paladin concept. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo reiterate and rank my concepts..<br/>\n<br/>\n1. The young Paladin, descendant of Alaric, seeking to re-consecrate his ancestor's tomb, and prove himself to be worthy of Alaric's legacy. I can see Dream and Fate, off the bat, applying to my young Paladin. (Fighter Role, Secondary Cleric Role)<br/>\n<br/>\n2. A young, brash fighter, seeking to prove herself, willing to take on almost any mission... and for whatever reason, choosing this one. Oh, this concept is ripe for Drives. Frankly, it's a matter of narrowing down the choices to 4, as this is a character I've played in various iterations through the years. (Fighter Role)<br/>\n<br/>\n3. A Cleric of Thyr, sent by the new High Priest to learn the fate of Abysthor, and perhaps to find out what he went into the Stoneheart for. Duty fits at first blush. Others would change the concept in interesting ways, and need further consideration. (Cleric Role)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, yes.. My choices would be to have the Paladin first (if we've got someone interested in playing a full cleric), Fighter second (also assuming we've got a cleric, but if people think that the fighter would be better than the Paladin, I'm cool with that, too) and Cleric third (if no one else is interested in playing a cleric.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116236/#Comment_116236" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-24T17:42:29+00:00" title="December 24, 2007  5:42PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm - I'm not sure my schedule will permit me to play; it might take a few more days before I know for certain.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt looks like Wolfe wants to play a lot of the beat-down tank characters, with a greater or lesser degree of clerical support.

A young cleric who is a student of Abysthor's teachings and life, setting out to follow the lost High Priest and discover what happened to him.<br>2.) A cleric on a holy crusade against the evil priests of Orcus.<br>3.)

Ryan, if you think you've got the "rogue" end of things handled, then I'll quit worrying about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am most intrigued by the Aasimar Cleric idea.  I know, that's just a race and class combination, but it gives me a whole slew of ideas for Drives that, say, a human or elven cleric would not necessarily lend themselves to.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore mechanics questions (it's the way I think, I like to get the hard and fast mechanistic things out of the way before I move on to the soft and fluid story things) -<br/>\n<br/>\nWho is Thyr?  Muir?  What Pantheon do they come from, and which pantheon are we using?  This will have a bearing on my cleric in terms of Domains and the existence of other "known" deities.  It may also affect the Drives I select.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I'd like some clarification on the setting.  Are the setting elements grounded in any published campaign setting, or instead unique to this game?  How quickly do you expect that we will advance, and how far do you expect that we will advance?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's about it for now.<br/>\n~Rob                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116329/#Comment_116329" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-26T11:16:01+00:00" title="December 26, 2007 11:16AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Thyr - God of Justice<br/>Domains: Law, Good, Healing, Knowledge, Protection<br/>Typical Worshipers: Humans, Royalty<br/>Favored Weapons: Light or Heavy Mace<br/><br/>Thyr is the god of wise and just rule. He is normally depicted as a wized king seated ona great throne holding a rod of kingship in one hand and a chalice of peace in the other hand.  His principles are Justice, Order and Peace. He represents proper and traditional rule and as such was once worshiped (at least with lip service) by all human royalty. He is the embodiment of the enlightened human caste system where each person failty has their place in a lawfully ordered society aimed at the good of all people. The noble eagle and the lion are his sacred creatures.<br/></blockquote>\n<blockquote><br/>Muir - Goddess of Virtue (Paladins)<br/>Domains: Law, Good, Protection, War<br/>Typical Worshipers: Humans, Paladins<br/>Favored Weapons: Longswords or Bastard Swords<br/><br/>Muir is the sister of Thyr.  Where he represents Law and Peace, she represents the martial valor necessary to make that peace a reality.  As such, she is the goddess of paladins.  She is often depicted as a dark-tressed maiden warrior in shining mail with an upraised sword.  The tenets of her worship are Honor, Truth and Courage.  A great order of paladins known as The Justicars are sworn to her service.  She expects self-sacrifice, humility and charity as well as unswerving loyalty.  Her standards are extreme and she quickly turns her back on any who fail to live up to them.  The falcon is her sacred animal.<br/></blockquote>\nThat's what I have on the pantheon.  Orcus is around in the module as well.<br/><br/>The setting elements are what I've found in the module which is pretty generic as far as specific settings are concerned.  I really hope/expect the setting to get fleshed out during character creation and during play.  And by "fleshed out" I don't mean just by me.<br/><br/>I expect you should advance from 2nd to around 8th level during the course of the module.  I think that should probably take 3 to 6 months of 1 time a week play depending on how quickly people shoot through things.  If everyone is very focused then it will go faster.  If everyone is more relaxed and meandering, then longer.<br/><br/>~Andrew                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_116345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aly" title="Aly"><img alt="Aly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aly">Aly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116345/#Comment_116345" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-26T13:04:37+00:00" title="December 26, 2007  1:04PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posting as was speaking previously regarding the game before the info seemed to get moved here.

Especially among the nobility, but to a lesser extent through all classes, there is a slight but well-entrenched sexism. Among the nobility, women are expected to stick to womanly tasks, such as music, embroidery and such. Among the common folk, they're relegate to similar tasks, taking care of the household, or service jobs like barmaids or cleaning women. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not unheard of for women to be adventurers, but it's subtly frowned on, as though the women are unwomanly in some way.. which often leads to it being the case. Most adventuring women are tomboys who rebelled against the roles society had prepared for them. <br/>\n<br/>\n2. The Cult of Orcus is known to kidnap people for use as slaves or sacrifices. While they don't necessarily go out of their way to do so, there is a marked preference for adherents to the older religions, as there is some animosity between Orcus and the siblings Thyr and Muir within the mythology of the realm.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_116353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116353/#Comment_116353" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-26T14:33:13+00:00" title="December 26, 2007  2:33PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To be fair, the Warlock's trapfinding is pretty nil, but break/destroy objects is good (shatter!) and target-single-enemies will be good too.<br/><br/>But I'm not married to that character - I'd be happy playing the Barbarian or the Sorcerer, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116354/#Comment_116354" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-26T14:56:50+00:00" title="December 26, 2007  2:56PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I only statted up the Bard because I thought we had a 3-person party.

He was well on his way to doing so, (probably a 5th level Paladin) when Jaeden was kidnapped by the Cult of Orcus. His brother hurried to rescue him, but was ambushed by the Cult, who had been hoping he'd come. Nevertheless, he managed to rescue his twin, but was captured and killed in the process. Jaeden escaped with his brother's sword, and nothing else. Since then, without the knowledge of his family, Jaeden has taken up his brother's mantle, attempting both to live up to his own dream of living the legacy of Alaric, and to fulfill the destiny his brother would have, if not for Jaeden's capture.<br/><br/><b>ST:</b> 14 +2<br/><b>DX:</b> 10 +0<br/><b>CN:</b> 10 +0<br/><b>IN:</b> 10 +0<br/><b>WS:</b> 12 +1<br/><b>CH:</b> 16 +3<br/><br/><b>AC:</b> 18, <b>flatfooted:</b> 18, <b>touch:</b> 10<br/><b>Fort</b> +6 <b>Ref</b> +3 <b>Will</b> +4<br/><b>Init:</b> 0<br/><b>Hitpoints:</b> 10+1d10<br/><b>BAB</b> +2, <b>Melee:</b> +4, <b>Ranged</b> +2<br/><br/><b>Skills:</b><br/>-Diplomacy: +6<br/>-Heal: +3<br/>-Know (nobles and royals): +2<br/>-Know (religion): +2<br/>-Ride: +3<br/>-Sense Motive: +4<br/><br/><b>Feats:</b> Endurance, Diehard<br/><b>Paladin Abilities:</b> Proficiencies, Aura of Good, Detect Evil, Smite Evil 1/day, Divine Grace, Lay on Hands 6pts<br/><br/><b>Drives:</b><br/>-Dream: Be Worthy of Alaric's Legacy<br/>-Self-Worth: My family would disapprove of my choice (if they knew!)<br/>-Atonement: I caused my brother's death; Now I must take his place<br/>-Hatred of the Cult of Orcus, who killed my brother<br/><br/><b>Equipment:</b><br/>M-Work Longsword\t-315<br/>Javelin(3) \t\t-3<br/>Splint Mail \t\t-200<br/>Shield, Heavy, Wooden \t-7<br/>Holy Symbol, Silver \t-25<br/>Horse, Light\t\t-75<br/>Sundries\t\t-(=<b>Remaining Cash</b>\t\t=<b>Name:</b> Nikki Steiner<br/>2nd Level Human Fighter<br/><br/>Nikki was raised by an uncle who ran a prominent tavern, often frequented by mercenaries and adventurers. She worked in the tavern from childhood, growing up on the stories of the mercenaries and adventurers. With no real woman's hand in her raising, she grew up a tomboy, and pestered the regulars to teach her what they knew. Some few took a liking to the tough, persistent little girl, and taught her a few things, which grew, over the years, into real talent and potential. One night, not too long ago, she packed up a few things and left to make her fortune as an adventurer. Since then, despite the doubts of the male population, she has done moderately well for herself, though she is still frequently discounted as "just a girl".<br/><br/><b>ST:</b> 15 +2<br/><b>DX:</b> 15 +2<br/><b>CN:</b> 12 +1<br/><b>IN:</b> 14 +2<br/><b>WS:</b> 8 -1<br/><b>CH:</b> 10 +0<br/><br/><b>AC:</b> 18, <b>flatfooted:</b> 16, <b>touch:</b> 12<br/><b>Fort</b> +3 <b>Ref</b> +2 <b>Will</b> +0<br/><b>Init:</b> +2<br/><b>Hitpoints:</b> 11+1d10+1<br/><b>BAB</b> +2, <b>Melee:</b> +4, <b>Ranged</b> +4<br/><br/><b>Skills:</b><br/>-Climb +7<br/>-Jump +7<br/>-Swim +7<br/>-Tumble +4.5 (+2 synergy from 5 ranks in Jump)<br/>-Handle Animal +5<br/><br/><b>Spoken Languages:</b> Common, Elven, Dwarven<br/><b>Feats:</b> Dodge, Two Weapon Fighting, Two Weapon Defense, Combat Expertise<br/><b>Fighter Abilities:</b> Proficiencies, 2 bonus feats<br/><br/><b>Drives:</b><br/>-Duty: Personal Code of Honor (details forthcoming)<br/>-Self-Destructive: hates being dismissed as just a girl<br/>-Hate (or Fear): Undead; the very idea inspires revulsion in her<br/>-<br/><br/><b>Equipment:</b><br/>M-Work Breastplate\t-350<br/>Longsword\t\t-15<br/>Shortsword\t\t-10<br/>Morningstar\t\t-8<br/>L.

The front line looks a trifle light - but with a melee-focused Ranger or Cleric, we should be all right.  I'm more concerned about lacking an Arcane Caster, but like I said I could probably go Necromancer as easily as Bard.  (Actually I've never played a D&amp;D; caster before, and would really like to give it a shot.  So maybe that all works out.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI've never played 3.X, but my take on the Bard is that it's designed to almost-fill several niches at once - it's decent at fighting, has a lot of enchantment magic, makes a decent scout, and has a bunch of buffing effects.  It's also an excellent negotiator.  But a Bard might be redundant based on the choices listed above.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_116372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Argent" title="Argent"><img alt="Argent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Argent">Argent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116372/#Comment_116372" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-26T17:35:02+00:00" title="December 26, 2007  5:35PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 26, 2007 5:40PM by Argent.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that, based on first preferences, this looks like a strong party!

Especially among the nobility, but to a lesser extent through all classes, there is a slight but well-entrenched sexism. Among the nobility, women are expected to stick to womanly tasks, such as music, embroidery and such. Among the common folk, they're relegate to similar tasks, taking care of the household, or service jobs like barmaids or cleaning women.<br/><br/>It's not unheard of for women to be adventurers, but it's subtly frowned on, as though the women are unwomanly in some way.. which often leads to it being the case. Most adventuring women are tomboys who rebelled against the roles society had prepared for them.<br/><br/>2. The Cult of Orcus is known to kidnap people for use as slaves or sacrifices. While they don't necessarily go out of their way to do so, there is a marked preference for adherents to the older religions, as there is some animosity between Orcus and the siblings Thyr and Muir within the mythology of the realm.<br/></blockquote>\nThose of you who haven't actually statted your characters, would you mind giving it a go?

Descendents of heroes often, as a mark of prestige, take a surname addition derivative of the hero's name, for instance D'Alaric, De Conan, or perhaps even D'Abysthor (don't know if his line would consider him heroic enough to take the name, considering it's only been 15 years, and his fate is unknown, but as an example). <br><br>Also, from looking over the Warlock, it looks as though a Warlock could fill in the Wizard role just fine, though I'm slightly confused about how you gain more invocations. On the one hand, it appears to say that you only learn new invocations at 1, 6, 11 and 16. On the other, the number of "invocations known" goes up at a much faster rate. So I'm guessing at 6, 11 and 16, you gain access to invocations of higher level, but you gain new invocations as indicated in the invocations known column. <br><br>James: Nasty little addition in your 3rd Drive.

Carrying on her father's reforms has made her unpopular with the Nobles, who often give her a hard time and occasionally rise up in revolt.  Politically, it's hard for anyone to get anything done - so the place is gradually falling apart (viz., the rise of the Orcus Cult).  Economically, the need to field large armies has bankrupted the monarchy and many of the aristocrats (i.e., people are eager to plunder old dungeons for rumors of treasure).  The Queen has taken the tribute of Bard's Gate and declared it a "free city," governed by its local merchants.<br/>\n<br/>\n* The Burgomeisters of the Free City of Bard's Gate are too busy defending the city walls against the Nobles, the Gnoll reavers, and other fantasy monsters to care much about the folks elsewhere in the river valley.  The peasants have taken to isolated strongholds to learn how to defend themselves w/o expensive armor, magic, or weapons.  (I.e., there's a reason for Monks to exist.)<br/>\n<br/>\n* Over the last century, the Cult of Panguire has eclipsed the faiths of Muir and Tyr--through the innovation of selling indulgences.  The Panguiric Bishops, larded with wealth, have bought influence with the cash-strapped, politically conservative aristocracy.  (I.e., in the three-way struggle between the Queen, the Nobles, and the Merchants, the Cult of Panguire is giving money to the Nobles while not antagonizing the corrupt practices of the Merchants.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_116400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116400/#Comment_116400" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-26T20:11:37+00:00" title="December 26, 2007  8:11PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 26, 2007 11:14PM by Wolfe.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeff, <br><br>A couple things I'm not understanding about your character...<br><br>Skill Trick?

Is there a related fear - maybe of undead, of places the dead lurk - that you could use instead?  That would come up in scenes and drive XP for all of us.  Then again, 1 Drive should relate to a party member.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite>* Love of Casmyre, a demonic servant of Orcus<br/>* Fear of Casmyre, a demonic servant of Orcus</blockquote>Might be too many eggs in Casmyre's basket, especially if we end up killing her in 5 rounds (as is tradition in such relationships).  Why not devote one the top one to "Love of demons, and is easily seduced by their promises" ?  That has more chances to come up (every imp we come across becomes a bigger conflict)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite>-Dream: Be Worthy of Alaric's Legacy<br/>-Self-Worth: My family would disapprove of my choice (if they knew!)<br/>-Atonement: I caused my brother's death; Now I must take his place<br/>-Hatred of the Cult of Orcus, who killed my brother</blockquote>I think these are a bit one-sided - they all have to do with family, basically.  Also, one should be related to a party member.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Argent</cite>Love \u2013 Has strong feelings of friendship for one of the male characters in the party (probably a Paladin or Fighter) because he embodies that which she admires \u2013 confidence in self, martial ability, decisiveness \u2013 and also because he, more than any others, seems to accept her for who she is without ridicule or dismissal.  Perhaps she met him in Bard's Gate or they happen to be from the same small farming village.</blockquote>I think this would be even better if it were tied to one of the darker characters, like Zaxa or Scythe, because that way it's more likely to relate to conflict and drive the game.  It also creates a connection between polar opposites in the party which is a really nice thing when you're five levels underground.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite>-Duty: Personal Code of Honor (details forthcoming)<br/>-Self-Destructive: hates being dismissed as just a girl<br/>-Hate (or Fear): Undead; the very idea inspires revulsion in her</blockquote>One needs to relate to another PC, but I'm not sure the first one is really going to be source of conflict, but mostly just need more definition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_116403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116403/#Comment_116403" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-26T21:12:30+00:00" title="December 26, 2007  9:12PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re: Jaeden's Drives: Fair enough.

He is intrigued by curses as well, and is greedy for magical items.  While he won't be a tactics moron, he will push to stay in a battle when there is a question of retreat.<br/><br/>Control:  Despite being raised near religious types and having many connections to them, Scythe is disgusted by authority and sees demon worship and divine worship in the same light.  To show that they don't control him, he likes making trouble for religious types like Mohiel or Jaeden, usually by getting them to go along with him to something dangerous.  His "control issue" is that he should be asked, not told, to do something.  He hates the idea of being charmed or mind controlled.  Edit: I'd really like it if Scythe had been wrongfully accused of some terrible crime, and grudgingly exonerated.<br/><br/>Love: Despite himself, Scythe is extremely protective of those who neither reject him nor fall under his sway (a vanishingly small number, but including at least one party member I hope).  These people he says are "worth it".  He has a dry, fatalistic humor and enjoys being the black sheep.

Carrying on her father's reforms has made her unpopular with the Nobles, who often give her a hard time and occasionally rise up in revolt. Politically, it's hard for anyone to get anything done - so the place is gradually falling apart (viz., the rise of the Orcus Cult). Economically, the need to field large armies has bankrupted the monarchy and many of the aristocrats (i.e., people are eager to plunder old dungeons for rumors of treasure). The Queen has taken the tribute of Bard's Gate and declared it a "free city," governed by its local merchants.<br/><br/>* The Burgomeisters of the Free City of Bard's Gate are too busy defending the city walls against the Nobles, the Gnoll reavers, and other fantasy monsters to care much about the folks elsewhere in the river valley. The peasants have taken to isolated strongholds to learn how to defend themselves w/o expensive armor, magic, or weapons. (I.e., there's a reason for Monks to exist.)<br/><br/>* Over the last century, the Cult of Panguire has eclipsed the faiths of Muir and Tyr--through the innovation of selling indulgences. The Panguiric Bishops, larded with wealth, have bought influence with the cash-strapped, politically conservative aristocracy. (I.e., in the three-way struggle between the Queen, the Nobles, and the Merchants, the Cult of Panguire is giving money to the Nobles while not antagonizing the corrupt practices of the Merchants.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite><br/>3.

Skill tricks are bought with skill points, and are cross class for every class (so, they cost 2 points each).  You can only have one skill trick for every two levels of character class.<br/><br/>On p 87 of <i>Complete Scoundrel</i>, Hidden Blade basically allows me to hide an item on my person using Sleight of Hand (a dagger in Haakon's case).  If an opponent cannot spot the hidden weapon, I can draw it using a move action and attack that opponent with a standard action, and the opponent is considered flat-footed against that attack (which works nicely with sneak attack.  I just like the image of the dagger popping into Haakon's hand and plunging into an opponent's chest before he knows what happened.  There is another skill trick called Mosquito's Bite where the opponent <i>won't even realize he's been hit</i> until after his next action.  He has to act like I missed. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>(There is an excellent samurai movie called <i>The Hidden Blade</i> where the main character has just such a secret technique.)<br/><br/>Haakon currently has a +8 in Sleight of Hand, and the PHB (on page 82) states that a dagger is easier to hide and gets a +2 on the check, so +10 to hide a dagger.  To make things simpler, we can just say that Haakon takes 10 on hiding his dagger, so it's a DC 20 (+8 Skill +2 for Dagger +10 for Taking 10) for the Spot check.  Or I can roll.

So my 900 gp is all in equipment (I'll buy a Riding Dog with the remaining 150 and start with 0 cash in my pocket).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_116460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116460/#Comment_116460" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-27T07:40:05+00:00" title="December 27, 2007  7:40AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why would Scythe have a riding dog?

Once feared for his axe, Gaerik is now a canny merchant whose trading company often hires adventurers to guard his caravans.  While wealthy enough to be one of the rulers of Bard's Gate, Gaerik despises human politics.<br/><br/><b>Grilk </b>-- A rather dim half-orc who came to worship Thyr as a way of seeking justice for the wrongs done to him as a child.  Grilk is happiest when someone can give him orders, and likes to "make 'em all better!" (Healing is his domain.)  His friendship with Haakon seems unlikely, until you see the two of them drinking at a tavern.  Often they're the only two left standing at the end of the night. <br/><br/><b>Olhilda Sigbj\xf6rnsdottir </b>-- Haakon's wife-to-be for the last 10 years (dwarven courtship rituals are complicated.)  Haakon's marriage was arranged before his falling out with his family, but Olhilda has convinced her family to not dissolve the agreement yet.  He has some time to prove that he is still a good match for her.  Olhilda is quite a beauty for a dwarf, and works with clockwork mechanisms in her father's shop.  <br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contacts</span></b><br/><br/><b>Doraedim Mythlord </b>-- An Elven bard/rogue who runs a gambling establishment in Bard's Gate and often passes along interesting tidbits of information to other people... for a price.  Everyone who wants information from him, however, must play a game of dice with the elf, "double or nothing."  It's rumored that Doraedim is a master at swapping in loaded dice for this game, but if you accuse him of cheating he will never sell information to you again... and will sell information about you to others at a discount.<br/><br/><b>Chalgzk </b>-- Perhaps the unluckiest gnoll in existence.  Chalgzk was born with a clubfoot and a disfigured face, which led to him being outcast from the local gnoll tribe.  He found "employment" for a time in a traveling carnival freakshow.  It wasn't much, but it meant regular food and shelter.  At least until he was "set free" by well-meaning townspeople.  Free to starve, Chalgzk became an enforcer for a small gang... until that gang was arrested for smuggling.  Chalgzk now holds the unenviable position of the lowest member of the Bard's Gate underworld... but he hears things.  He makes a living doing dirty jobs that no one else wants, and most people underestimate his intelligence due to his race and appearance.  Haakon has found the gnoll a useful resource on occasion.  <br/><br/><b>Harold Westingham III </b>-- A rich human merchant who is constantly paranoid about the safety of his treasures.  He often hires Haakon ("the little man" he calls him) to test the traps and locks that he purchases to keep his vault safe.  Why the ever-paranoid merchant trusts a greedy dwarf is anyone's guess, but Haakon has managed to resist the temptation to steal anything -- so far.  Harold owns a large amount of land outside of Bard's Gate, worked by tenants, and is concerned about the increase in monstrous activity.  <br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Enemies</span></b><br/><br/><b>Svala </b>-- A female human barbarian who worked with Haakon on an earlier job.  Haakon was inexperienced at the time and did not properly disarm a trap that went off in Svala's face, scarring her.  The rest of the party left Svala for dead, but she recovered and has been hunting down the party members ever since.  Haakon is the last one left.<br/><br/><b>Alfr Arnsson </b>-- A dwarven transmuter who seeks to become Olhilda's husband.  The son of a rich family (second only to the Battleborns), Alfr was delighted to hear of Haakon's disgrace and is working behind the scenes to make the young dwarf an outcast.  While he considers himself a ladies' man, with rich clothes, heavy perfume, and oiled beard, (Alfr is something of a dandy, for a dwarf), he is held in contempt by many dwarven females for his male chauvinist ways and foul temper.<br/><br/><b>Laerad </b>-- A mysterious human druid in the wilds outside Bard's Gate, Laerad appears to be an old man, with a long white beard and tanned weathered skin.  He wields a staff of ash and commands many animals and plant creatures.  He likes to appear as an old hermit to travelers.  Those who respect nature and offer friendship to the "hermit" can gain his protection.  Haakon called him an "old fool of a vagrant" and booted him out of the camp.  Now Haakon often finds his gear attacked by small animals, scorpions in his boots, and other natural "accidents" happening whenever he ventures out of the city.<br/><br/>Maybe I'll change my Dream Drive to "I will become worthy of marrying Olhilda."<br/><br/>I think I'll change my Self-Worth drive to "Goal:  I will not let that thief Scythe outdo me in anything." <img alt=":)" class="emoji"

              Andrew -<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a "setting" suggestion that's pretty radical, so if it doesn't work for you (or the other players) I won't be offended at all.  Can we cap the power level of the campaign?  Ages ago, I really wanted to run a game where nobody in the world was higher than Level 12.  Ryan, of course, developed E6 where people stop at Level 6 and gain marginal advantages after that.  Exactly where to draw the line is a matter of taste.<br/>\n<br/>\nA cap on advancement - i.e., eliminating the Drizzt's, Raistlin's, and Elminster's (or, more precisely, making them far less powerful) - makes the action much closer to the ground.  If we survive to 8th Level, we may still be overshadowed by a few guys - but they won't be god-like in their power.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am completely infatuated with the Level Demographics chart on page 139 of the DMG, though I much prefer the changes made to it in the Eberron campaign setting, which are more or less as follows (this would work really well for me personally, may not be to others' taste) -<br/>\n* Small Town (900-2000 people) - handful of guys around lvl 3<br/>\n* Large Town (2000-5000 people) - handful of guys around lvl 5, about twice that many around lvl 2-3<br/>\n* Small City (5000 - 12000 people) - handful of guys around lvl 7, about twice that many around lvl 3-4<br/>\n* Large City (12000-25000 people) - two handfuls of guys around lvl 9, about twice that many around lvl 4-5<br/>\n* Metropolis (25000+ people, only a few cities in medieval Europe were this big) - three handfuls of people around lvl 11, twice as many around lvl 5-6<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Bard's Gate is a Small or Large City, when we hit Level 8 we'll be romping, stomping challenges to the local power structure...........                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116481/#Comment_116481" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-27T08:40:01+00:00" title="December 27, 2007  8:40AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 27, 2007 3:48PM by Ry.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, I'll do the rest in a bit, but here's my ideas so far (I checked with jhosmer that these are cool with him)<br><br><b><i>Enemies</i></b><br><br><b>Passer Verat:</b>  Cleric of Muir who was "saddled" with Scythe - essentially Scythe's adopted father after the disappearance of his father Abysthor and later his mother.  Scythe learned quickly that Passer despised him, and punished Scythe at every opportunity.  After the robbery and murder at the Westingham manor, Passer was the one who accused Scythe of the crime.  He was also present as Scythe was "interrogated" (Scythe confessed the crime during his "interrogation", even though he wasn't guilty).  <br><br><b>Chag:</b> Gnoll brother of Chalgzk, though few know the connection - murderer of Harold Westingham IV.  The orc was caught outside town trying to remove the signet ring from Harold IV's severed hand (this was shortly after Scythe confessed).  The Gnoll ultimately escaped, wounded, from the encounter, but Scythe wants to settle the score for being tortured.<br><br><br><i><b>Allies</b></i><br><br><b>Doraedim Mythlord</b> - Doraedim was with the party that saw the gnoll Chag, and afterwards helped clear Scythe's name.  Doraedim is one of the few people that Scythe thinks is "Worth it."  For some reason relating to an obscure elven tradition, Doraedim let Scythe stay with him after Scythe was exonerated, and despite the fact that in human lands Scythe would be indebted to him is extremely tolerant of Scythe's requests.  When he has it, Scythe gives information to Doraedim freely and expects none in return.  <br><br><b>Contacts</b><br/><br/><b>Svala</b> - an old fling of Scythe's - she worked with Haakon some time previously and after she was scarred they didn't hook up again.  Scythe doesn't think she's gone crazy but heard the other people who worked with her got killed.<br/><br/><b>The Dragon Face</b>: Scythe doesn't know what this entity is but has seen it a few times - the Dragon Face haunts him and has whispered to him in the past. Scythe assumes this is some kind of family curse but generally knows well enough not to mention it (remembering Passer's beatings).                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_116486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116486/#Comment_116486" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-27T08:52:38+00:00" title="December 27, 2007  8:52AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James,<br/><br/>I'm not going to cap the levels, per se, but I really like the chart that you printed out there.  I will be using it as a guideline.  This will not be the Forgotten Realms, where there is a level 18 character under every rock.

Alaric, the Paladin of Muir, was an Aasimar, and he fathered a large family with his faithful wife before he met his end.  None of his immediate descendants showed any trace of Planetouched heritage.  Since the time of his death, his offspring have multiplied greatly - to the point that not all of his descendants are aware of their Alaric bloodline heritage.  Surprisingly, none of his prominently known descendants have been born as Aasimar, and it is thought that his divine heritage ended with his death.  This is not true, for Aasimar have been born from time to time within Alaric's "forgotten" bloodlines, and so far nobody has connected them together and traced them back to the source.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am finishing Mohiel and will post her again later today.  I did take Ryan's advice concerning drives and altered the target of Mohiel's Love to Zaxa.  It's a kind of opposited attract, sisterly kind of drive that I think has potential for good story content (conflicts, issues, etc).  At the moment I am working on the 3x3 Card - I hope nobody minds too much if I grab some of the already defined Allies, Contacts, and Enemies and linked Mohiel to them.

It will have to be split into two posts.  As things change, I will just edit these two posts instead of making new ones.<br><br><b>MOHIEL NYSTEDI</b><br><b>Female 1st Level Aasimar Cleric of Thyr</b><br><b>Speed 20\u2019, 9 Hit Points</b><br/><br/><b>Background</b>  Mohiel hails from the small farming village of Wortham, about three days travel from Bard\u2019s Gate.  Mohiel was born different, having porcelain-fine skin that contrasted greatly with hair and eyes the color of dark honey.  She was raised in a farm family but was the object of scorn and suspicion, both for her looks and for her ability to learn quickly.  There were none in the village her age that were her equal, and even members of her own family were in the habit of belittling her.  Her unhappy life took a turn for the better when she caught the attention of a cleric of Thyr who was passing through the village on his way to Bard\u2019s Gate.  Perhaps Thom Wilborne recognized her celestial heritage on sight, but for whatever reason he made arrangements for Mohiel to be tested for service in the name of Thyr.  Mohiel passed the tests easily, and for the next eight years of her life she trained to become a Cleric in service to Thyr.  Those years did much to heal the emotional wounds she had suffered in her childhood, and she made a handful of friends among the people of Bard\u2019s Gate.  She also made a few enemies \u2013 someone as striking and capable as she seemed to ruffle the feathers of many traditionalists and chauvinists in town.  Finally the High Priest of the Temple of Thyr considered Mohiel to be ready to serve the church directly, as an adventuring Cleric, and his charge to her was not easy:  Her task was to purge the Stoneheart Dungeon of the Cult of Orcus.  She felt daunted by the enormity of it.  She didn\u2019t even know where to start, or if she was even capable of putting her Clerical knowledge and abilities to that sort of practical use.  Yet, because of the eerie dreams and visions which visited her from time to time, she felt that this duty was somehow ordained for her, and she resigned to do it.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Drives</span><br/><b>Duty</b>  Purge the Stoneheart Dungeon of the Cult of Orcus.  She truly doubts that she is capable of fulfilling this duty, but it is what her superiors expect of her.  There may even be an element of fear at play here, as well.<br/><br/><b>Self-Worth</b>  Mohiel suffers from nagging thoughts of inadequacy stemming from her depressing treatment by family and villagers during her childhood.<br/><br/><b>Love</b> Mohiel has strong sisterly feelings for Zaxa.  A strange dichotomy is at play within Mohiel\u2019s heart.  On the one hand, she can identify with Zaxa \u2013 as a woman who doesn\u2019t fit the mold, and even as a woman that is shunned, avoided, or ridiculed by \u201ccommon\u201d folk.  On the other hand, Zaxa seems utterly lost and fascinated with dark, evil things \u2013 Mohiel believes, perhaps foolishly, that Zaxa is in need of redemption and that such redemption can only come about through compassion.<br/><br/><b>Fate</b>  Has dreams or visions that indicate she will play a central role in restoring the strength of the Thyrrian faith.  Her own struggle with self-worth causes her to dismiss these \u201cdaydreams\u201d.  What she does not know is that she is a blood descendant of Alaric the Paladin, who himself was a Planetouched.  The branch of Alaric\u2019s line that Mohiel comes from has faded into obscurity since his death, and she is the first of that line for the Celestial blood to resurface.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ability Scores</span><br/><b>STR</b>  13<br/><b>DEX</b>  12<br/><b>CON</b>  12<br/><b>INT</b>  14<br/><b>WIS</b>  16  <i>(14 base, +2 racial)</i><br/><b>CHA</b>  13 <i>(11 base, +2 racial)</i><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Saves</span><br/><b>FORT</b>  +3<br/><b>REF</b>  +1<br/><b>WILL</b>  +5<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Senses</span><br/><b>Listen</b>  +3<br/><b>Search</b>  +2<br/><b>Spot</b>  +3<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Combat</span><br/><b>AC</b>  18 (17 flatfooted, 11 touch)<br/><b>Hit Points</b>  9<br/><b>Melee</b>  Heavy Mace +1 (1d8+1)<br/><b>Ranged</b>  Sling +1 (1d4+1)<br/><b>Initiative</b>  +1<br/><b>Move</b>  20\u2019<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Spells Per Day</span><br/><b>0th level</b>  DC13, 3<br/><b>1st level</b>  DC14, 2 +1 domain<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Skills Chosen (Maxed)</span><br/>Concentration +5<br/>Diplomacy +5<br/>Heal +7<br/>Knowledge (Religion) +6<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Feats</span><br/>Improved Turning<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clerical Domains</span><br/>Healing, Knowledge<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Racial Abilities</span><br/>Acid, Cold, Electricity Resistance 5<br/>Base Speed 30\u2019<br/>Darkvision 60\u2019<br/>+2 bonus on Spot and Listen checks<br/>Can use Daylight once per day (caster level equals cleric level) (supernatural power)<br/>Languages:  Common, Celestial, Draconic, Dwarven<br/><br/>Equipment:  Banded Mail, Buckler, Heavy Mace, Dagger, Sling, 20 Sling Bullets, Silver Holy Symbol of Thyr, Healer\u2019s Kit, Backpack, Bedroll, Spell Component Pouch, Belt Pouch, Trail Rations (x7), Soap (1lb), Waterskin, Holy Water (x3), Aspergillum (holy water shaker), Explorer\u2019s Outfit, Cleric\u2019s Vestments, Blessed Bandages (x5), Oil of Bless Weapon, Oil of Magic Weapon (x2), 6 x Scrolls (Remove Fear, Sanctuary, Cure Light Wounds x 4), Potion Belt, Scroll Organizer, Parchment Sheets (x10), Inkpen, vial of ink.<br/><br/>Remaining funds:  31 gp, 6 sp                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Argent" title="Argent"><img alt="Argent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Argent">Argent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116665/#Comment_116665" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-27T16:55:06+00:00" title="December 27, 2007  4:55PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here is the 3 x 3 card for Mohiel (mostly finished)<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Allies</span><br/><b>1.  Thom Wilborne</b>  Human Cleric of Thyr \u2013 Thom is the one who first discovered the significance of Mohiel\u2019s Aasimar nature.  He sensed great potential within her, and desired to remove her from the awful emotional harm being inflicted upon her in Wortham.  He is a ranking Cleric in the Temple of Thyr in Bard\u2019s Gate, and has been both teacher and mentor to Mohiel.  He is old enough to be her father, and sometimes he thinks of her as his daughter.  Although he used to be an adventuring cleric, those days are behind him and he is now the overseer of acolyte training at the Temple.<br/><br/><b>2.  Chalgzk</b>  Gnoll outcast and person of the streets \u2013 Mohiel and Chalgzk met by chance on the streets of Bard\u2019s Gate a few summers before.  Chalgzk had been set upon by some uncouth street ruffians who sought to torment him for being \u201cdifferent and crippled\u201d.  The young men left Chalgzk a bloody mess.  Mohiel took pity on him (remembering perhaps what it was like to be so cruelly treated) and brought him to the temple of Thyr, where he was able to recover.  She insisted upon tending to him personally, and Chalgzk never forgot her kindness or ready acceptance of who and what he was.<br/><br/><b>3.  As of yet un-named Ally</b><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Enemies</span><br/><b>1.  Uther D\u2019Halbric</b>, Human slave trader and former mercenary \u2013 Uther D\u2019Halbric runs the largest slave trading company in Bard\u2019s Gate.  Mohiel can not see how slavery is just, and one day when Uther and his slavers were marching some captured Gnolls through the city market, she confronted him about his profession.  Her passion and first-rate arguments swayed the nearby crowd, causing great embarrassment to Uther.  This made Uther very, very angry, and he has not forgotten the public insult.  He has sought to have her removed from the priesthood, because \u201cAfter all, the Thyrrian Church has no official position for or against slavery, as far as I know, and that porcelain-skinned acolyte needs to be taught a lesson about the real world.\u201d  <br/><br/><b>2.  Gloria Verat</b>, Female human, wife of Passer Verat \u2013 The clergy of Thyr and Muir meet often in social gatherings, and during one such dinner event, Gloria and Mohiel happened to sit across from one another.  It was during the ensuing discussion that the two women discovered how different their outlooks on life happened to be.  Like her husband, Passer, Gloria is judgemental and cruel at heart, although she puts on a nice public face.  Mohiel made the mistake of pointing this out to her during a heated discussion, and now Gloria seeks to tarnish or diminish Mohiel\u2019s image any chance she gets.  It probably didn\u2019t help things that Passer\u2019s eyes were constantly wandering over to stare at Mohiel during the course of the dinner.<br/><br/><b>3.  As of yet un-named Enemy</b><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contacts</span><br/><b>1.  Sha\u2019ri Windstrider</b>, Elven Prophetess \u2013 When Mohiel began having dreams and visions, she had to turn to someone outside the church for explanation and interpretation.  Sha\u2019ri is a Diviner who normally offers her magical services to the nobility and wealthy merchants in Bard\u2019s Gate.  She doesn\u2019t buy into all the nobilities political intrigues or even the \u201cdisturbing\u201d human attitudes regarding the roles of the sexes.  When Sha\u2019ri first met Mohiel and heard of her problem, the elven woman chose to assist as she could to shed light onto Mohiel\u2019s vague and nebulous dreams.  Sha\u2019ri also taught Mohiel the complex Draconic language.<br/><br/><b>2.  Olhilda Sigbjornsdottir</b>, female Dwarven clockmaker \u2013 taught Mohiel to speak Dwarven and the two spend time together in a decent tavern several nights weekly.  Olhilda and Mohiel have a similar outlook on life and are social friends who enjoy each other\u2019s company.<br/><br/><b>3.

So, like, the Spirited Charge feat comes from the Royal Lancers, who are the best cavalry in this region.  Maybe Great Cleave comes from a regiment of Dwarven mercenaries who carved through a goblin army that outnumbered them 10:1...<br/>\n<br/>\nThis appeals to me in part because it suggests backstory, and in part because it suggests connections between particular characters.  ("<i>You</i> were a freebooter on the Xardoon Sea too?")  There's a risk, though, that it might limit advancement options.  ("I'd really like to take Improved Disarm, but we're nowhere near Xardoon and I don't know any pirates...")  So maybe it's just for the really bad-ass feats toward the top of particular chains?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116677/#Comment_116677" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-27T17:43:23+00:00" title="December 27, 2007  5:43PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, James.

The NPC interactions and stuff will take the most time typing.<br/><br/>If I get a mic and stuff, I wouldn't mind trying voice out.<br/><br/>~Andrew                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116705/#Comment_116705" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-27T19:28:00+00:00" title="December 27, 2007  7:28PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 27, 2007 7:30PM by Ry.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I thought we were voice when I signed up...

Using Voice for out of character chatter and rules discussion, and using text for In-Character description and dialogue. It allows for getting a log of the in game events, but speeds up the parts that slow down play, namely dealing with the rules. <br/><br/>Still, text-only is viable, given a focused group. <br/><br/>Is OpenRPG capable of having two different general chat tabs, one for OOC and one for IC? This is a technique used on indierpgs on IRC, and it's one I find works very well.

From levels 1 through 3, they do not have a caster level.  To me this has always meant that they can't cast spells at all, even from scrolls.<br/>\n<br/>\nAndrew might think differently, however.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he does, then there are two problems that will face Jaeden when he tries to use the scrolls he has bought.  First is what you identified - the requirement to decipher the writings via Spellcraft check or Read Magic spell.  The second is that Jaeden will have to make a "caster level check" each time he wants to cast a spell from a scroll to succeed, which would be made even more difficult because he'd have a caster level of 0.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm thinking that Jaeden can buy a Potion of Read Magic (a 0-level potion for a Cleric or Wizard) and that would enable him to read and understand whatever scrolls he has purchased.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_117037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117037/#Comment_117037" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-29T18:40:57+00:00" title="December 29, 2007  6:40PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From the SRD:<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText"><b>Activation</b>To activate a scroll, a spellcaster must read the spell written on it. Doing so involves several steps and conditions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Decipher the Writing</b>The writing on a scroll must be deciphered before a character can use it or know exactly what spell it contains. This requires a read magic spell or a successful Spellcraft check (DC 20 + spell level).<br/>\n<br/>\nDeciphering a scroll to determine its contents does not activate its magic unless it is a specially prepared cursed scroll. A character can decipher the writing on a scroll in advance so that he or she can proceed directly to the next step when the time comes to use the scroll.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Activate the Spell</b>Activating a scroll requires reading the spell from the scroll. The character must be able to see and read the writing on the scroll. Activating a scroll spell requires no material components or focus. (The creator of the scroll provided these when scribing the scroll.) Note that some spells are effective only when cast on an item or items. In such a case, the scroll user must provide the item when activating the spell. Activating a scroll spell is subject to disruption just as casting a normally prepared spell would be. Using a scroll is like casting a spell for purposes of arcane spell failure chance.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo have any chance of activating a scroll spell, the scroll user must meet the following requirements.<br/>\n[ulist]<br/>\n[*]The spell must be of the correct type (arcane or divine). Arcane spellcasters (wizards, sorcerers, and bards) can only use scrolls containing arcane spells, and divine spellcasters (clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers) can only use scrolls containing divine spells. (The type of scroll a character creates is also determined by his or her class.)<br/>\n[*]The user must have the spell on his or her class list.<br/>\n[*]The user must have the requisite ability score.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the user meets all the requirements noted above, and her caster level is at least equal to the spell\u2019s caster level, she can automatically activate the spell without a check. If she meets all three requirements but her own caster level is lower than the scroll spell\u2019s caster level, then she has to make a caster level check (DC = scroll\u2019s caster level + 1) to cast the spell successfully. If she fails, she must make a DC 5 Wisdom check to avoid a mishap (see Scroll Mishaps, below). A natural roll of 1 always fails, whatever the modifiers.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nIt's just my interpretation, but I'd think that <u>buying</u> a scroll doesn't substitute for a Spellcraft check or a <i>read magic</i> spell.  On the other hand, "[t]he writing on a scroll must be deciphered", but the SRD doesn't say who must do the deciphering.  My instinct is that the character needs to do this for himself or herself, but the text doesn't outright say that.  So maybe Jaeden could hire an expert, pay for a <i>read magic</i> or get one of the party to do it for him?  Or, like Rob suggests, maybe a potion.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso -\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Through 3rd level, a paladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, her caster level is one-half her paladin level.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nSo I'd interpret that as the case described in the last paragraph of the text: I guess the DC of a first-level Paladin spell is DC 3 (1+2), which seems kinda low on a straight 1d20+0 roll...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_117038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117038/#Comment_117038" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-29T18:42:05+00:00" title="December 29, 2007  6:42PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Incidentally, maybe there should be a place on the wiki for rules discussions?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_117054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117054/#Comment_117054" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-29T20:42:47+00:00" title="December 29, 2007  8:42PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 29, 2007 8:48PM by Wolfe.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Using the same rules James quoted, Jaeden is capable of casting the spell, because:<br><br>1. He is of a class that can cast divine spells<br>2. The spell in question (Cure Light Wounds) is on his list<br>3. His Wisdom score is currently sufficient to cast 1st and 2nd level Paladin spells. CLW is a 1st level Paladin spell.<br><br>His caster level is 0 until level 4, at which point, it is half of his Paladin level. That means when he makes a caster level check, he adds 0 to his d20 roll, against a DC of 2 (1+spell level 1) so I'm not worried about the caster level, as I've only got a 5% chance of failing that. The crux falls entirely within the Spellcraft roll, or Read Magic. <br><br>I am considering shifting a couple of my vast number of skill points around to get a single point of Spellcraft. That and taking 20 would allow me to read a single 1st level spell, which would allow me to cast it later. Normally if a skill does not allow you to take 20, it says so in it's description. Spellcraft does not say anything against it. Given the description of the rules for taking 20, this should be kosher.. It'll just take him 2 minutes to read what normally takes 6 for a more experienced Spellcrafter. <br><br>Unless Andrew's interpretation of the rules is different than mine, I believe that's what I'll probably do.<br><br>James: I can easily enough set that up, I suppose.. I'm not entirely certain how it would work.. Someone edits the page to ask a question, and someone else edits the page to answer it? In that case, people would have to check the rules discussion page regularly, or you'd have to edit the main Abysthor page to make a note that there's a rules question...<br><br>Or did you mean just posting the decisions made on rules questions, so we have a record of precedent?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div

Sorry for the silence there.  New Years was a little more hectic than I thought.  My mother-in-law came for a visit and there were events to attend and such.<br/><br/>Here's the deal as I currently understand it.<br/><br/>1.) We will be playing on Tuesdays from 7pm - 10pm EST.  If this just will not work for anyone, I need to know very soon.  James, let me know if you end up being able to swing this.<br/>2.) We will be using OpenRPG.<br/>3.) If I can get Skype working on my computer, I'll be happy to use this also.  Everyone else using this isn't dependent on me.<br/>4.) We won't start until I get back from my cruise.  That means the first play session should be January 15th.  Is that cool with everyone?<br/><br/>Rules Question:<br/><br/>Paladins and Rangers (and other classes who don't get spells until later levels) may NOT use scrolls until they are capable of casting spells.  They are, however, allowed to use wands, staves, rods and other Spell Trigger devices of the same type of magic that they will eventually be able to cast (Divine or Arcane).  Thus, a 1st level Paladin cannot use any Clerical scrolls but can use a Staff of Healing.<br/><br/>~Andrew                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_117581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aly" title="Aly"><img alt="Aly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aly">Aly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117581/#Comment_117581" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-02T21:15:56+00:00" title="January  2, 2008  9:15PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As the initial part seems to be heading to the Tomb of Abysthor and without knowing exactly what Andrew has planned, did we wish to discuss how we meet to head off for the tomb?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_117612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117612/#Comment_117612" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-03T06:01:44+00:00" title="January  3, 2008  6:01AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have nothing "planned" other than what's in the module and even that is very fluid.

I'm torn between wanting to jump right into the action, and having the get together scene. In many D&amp;D games, the scene where the party forms is half-ass and painful, but I think given the amount of thought already put into connecting our characters and the setting, that it might be interesting. I'll weigh in later on after I've worked with the RelMap a little bit.. I think it might stir up some ideas for how our characters get to working together, either for handwaved backstory, or as a set up for a party formation scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_117617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117617/#Comment_117617" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-03T06:23:23+00:00" title="January  3, 2008  6:23AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to have the first scene somewhere near the dungeon but have us work out how the party got together here.

That way, instead of 6 strangers, everyone knows at least one other member well.<br/><br/>Alternatively, we could just have one character be the "boss" who hires the rest of us to go into the dungeon.  I mean, Haakon's expertise definitely makes him a good choice for being hired.<br/><br/>How about this:  <br/><br/>1) We decide on a leader, the guy who is getting us all together.<br/><br/>2)  Everyone writes a short post here (or on the wiki) saying where they are and what they are doing just before the leader shows up to recruit them.<br/><br/>3) We start the first actual session with all of us meeting up at the town gate to head out to the dungeon.  Maybe we can have a little encounter on the way to the dungeon, something to do with our 3x3 enemies or just some bandits, just to get things started.<br/><br/>What do you guys think?  It lets us do some backstory without taking too much time in the session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_117622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117622/#Comment_117622" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-03T06:56:45+00:00" title="January  3, 2008  6:56AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jaeden sounds like the most likely candidate for leader, at least that's how I see it.

Scythe swims in the same circles as Haakon and I'm not sure about Grell.

I think we've come to that point, so here's what I'd like to do.<br/><br/>I'd like to use the wiki to keep track of all the campaign data.  That seems to be a very good use for it.  <br/><br/>I've created a blog, <a href="http://bardsgate.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Bard's Gate</a>, to handle further discussion about the game.
