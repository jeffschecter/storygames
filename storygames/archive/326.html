                    Hi!<br/>
  I am not one of those stalwart proponents of this system or that system (although I do think pretty higly of my own system). But it seems to me if everything is conflict resolution, why do we need special rules for it?<br/>
  What's the advantage, why have it at all?<br/>

                            It depends on what sorts of conflicts you want to matter in the gamespace.  If you're playing a game of high skullduggery in the court of the Sun King, about the only combat you're going to see is the occassional duel - which should be a last resort.  Your ability to seduce, manipulate and conspire are much more important, and the mechanics of the game should reflect that.<br/><br/>So it's not so much 'conflict or no conflict' but 'what kind of conflict'.                        </div>

                            Kuma, the ideal rules are a description of how functional play has worked in the past. Ergo, if you figure out a good way to do CR using X written rules and Y house rules, and Z unspoken rules, then your write them down, you've got a good CR system.<br/><br/>So if you're using GURPS rules and coming to an implicit understanding of how to actually get stuff to happen in the story with those rules, make explicit what was implicit in the rules you play by, then when you write down your rules for others to use, write them <i>all</i> down.                        </div>

                            Dave, I'm going to be really rude and talk about Ben like he's not reading this, too.<br/><br/>Ben does this thing where he says that everybody uses Conflict Resolution because everybody resolves conflicts, which can be a little confusing to folks who don't know what conflict resolution <em>is</em> in isolation from the other bits of a game.  The most confusing part is that, technically speaking, Ben's more or less right.<br/><br/>However, when most folks say "Conflict Resolution" they're talking about a set of explicit rules that governs the resolution of conflicts.  Generally speaking we're talking about setting stakes and then players doing something (whether it's rolling, bidding, spending, whatever) to work towards that goal, and occasionally other players doing other things to frustrate the progress towards that goal.  The stuff that the players are doing have a specific and non-interpretted (or only slightly interpretted) effect that increases the likelihood that the stakes are fulfilled.  It's not the players doing stuff and the GM deciding if they did enough to get what they want; it's they players doing stuff and accruing points or working down the GM's dice pool or something that the GM can't just gloss over.  Everything is out in the open.<br/><br/>By contrast, the conflict resolution that "everybody uses" may be obfuscated, non-transparent, and determined by highly subjective judgment calls.  Everybody uses conflict resolution, sure -- not everybody uses straightforward, transparent, and relatively fair conflict resolution.  Most explicit rules for CR attempt to make things straightforward, transparent, and fair.<br/><br/>So my "sell" for Conflict Resolution?  Hey check it out, these rules are straightforward, transparent, and fair!                        </div>

                            Joshua, an important distinction between conflict and task resolution in practice, which may or may not break the generalized claims you've just made (summarizing Ben), is that conflict resolution entails a shared understanding of stakes. That is, fully realized, conflict resolution is a way of enforcing the meaning of any given outcome. If you wrestle me to the ground and I get up again afterward, task resolution says nothing about whether you "beat me". Conflict resolution is like you forcing me to say "uncle", thus symbolically creating a shared understanding.<br/><br/>In short the very concept of conflict resolution as a universal property of RPGs depends on the assumption that the participants defer to each other in identifying "conflicts" and naming their outcomes. But task resolution operates on a far less social level--as I wrote elsewhere, it works on the level of facts, not ideas. (Yes, everything that goes on in an RPG is really an idea, not a fact. But that just goes back to issues of aesthetics. Rembrandt's <i>The Night Watch</i> didn't turn into "an abstract arrangement of paint on a canvas" after Piet Mondrian started painting.) Task resolution is thus far more conducive--and vulnerable--to the subjective/individual level of interpretation than conflict resolution.<br/><br/>If anyone wants to look at this as more of a sliding scale than a strict breakdown, that's fine, too, as long as the distinction is preserved.  I do think that many so-called conflict resolution systems take on task-resolution-like properties if viewed from a higher scale. E.g., if "Do we capture the pirate ship?" isn't linked mechanically to "Do we find the treasure?", then the overall goal of the adventure is still subject to freeform connection of events. By contrast, <i>My Life With Master</i> has very strongly enforced semantic linkages from one resolution to the next, all leading ulimately to Endgame.                        </div>

                            Right, Elliot.  When most folks talk about CR, it's that transparency that you've identified -- everybody is on the same page as far as what might happen and what <em>does</em> happen.                        </div>

You don't have to identify a conflict as a conflict in order to resolve it.<br/>
<br/>
Indeed, many conflicts in Polaris are resolved without any conscious understanding that there was a conflict to begin with.<br/>
<br/>
What matters is not that a conflict is identified as a conflict.  What matters is that we care the outcome.<br/>

<br/>
One benefit of preserving the task resolution/conflict resolution distinction is that task resolution allows the participants to agree on facts while deferring agreement on their significance.<br/>
<br/>
Thus the utility of TR for games which emphasize strategy. If everyone fully understands the significance of all possible actions, then either there's no point in playing the game, or the winner is socially determined, or the entire thing becomes a crap shoot.                        </div>

                            Elliot -- I have a feeling that this issue is larger than this thread.  Suffice it to say that I don't see "everyone understands the significance of all possible actions" as tied to conflict resolution at all, nor do I see task resolution as necessarily tied "not everyone understands the significance of all possible actions."  Many conflict-resolving games support strategy -- Dogs and D&amp;D 3.5 (in combat) come to mind.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of "what if you care about the outcome and I don't" frankly, I don't care :-)  Use what Fred said, or whatever.  If a game can't make everyone care about the issue at stake, well, that's a pretty shitty game or a pretty shitty issue.<br/>

                            Perhaps my "what if you care" phrasing was too stark, or too subtle. The distinction I'm making is that what makes something task-resolution-y is that its significance is a matter of personal opinion or comprehension. (Significance in terms of "what it all means", not "does it mean anything at all?")<br/><br/>Take the usual spiel about getting info from a safe. The issue isn't whether I crack open the safe or not. What's important is "do I get the info?"<br/><br/>Sure. But then, what good does the info do me, if my ultimate goal is to capture the villain? Without a precise, transparent mechanical effect that shows I'm now one square closer to my goal, the significance of "getting the info" is deferred; it may be helping me, or it may just be a nice bit of color.<br/><br/>In both D&amp;D and Dogs, the strategizing is made possible because the conflict resolution is built on a foundation of atomic "moves". If the significance of all possible moves in either game's conflict resolution system were perfectly transparent, then they could all be calculated in advance yielding either an optimal result for the participants, a set of fixed probabilities based on optimal moves, or the determination that the outcome is really just a product of social negotiation.<br/><br/>It's the lack of certainty in the relationship between atomic moves and larger goals that I'm calling task resolution. It may come about either because of the lack of a mechanical linkage enforcing significance, or because the linkage is complex enough to prevent certainty about significance. MLwM offers extremely transparent, mechanical linkages between events and therefore I reckon it has about as much strategic depth as tic tac toe. But that's not the point of the game, so it's not a problem.<br/><br/>Fred, I'd like to draw your attention to the idea put forward by others that CR is about what the player wants as distinct from the character. If your goal is to erase the player/character distinction, then CR of the "say yes or roll dice" variety either implies antagonism (healthy for gamist play) or some sort of weird universe where my desire to climb Mt. Everest is sufficient to get me to the top (poison for varieties of immersion and/or "simulationist" play). The former because the GM is my opponent and will always call for dierolls; the latter because the GM doesn't really have a stake and will always give.<br/><br/>(It might help to repeat what I said earlier, maybe in a different thread: I'm not sure task resolution has a place in story games. I'll amend that to "mechanical task resolution which isn't mechanically incorporated into conflict resolution".)                        </div>

                            Elliot, <br/><br/>John Kim and I have been, for a bit, discussing the difference between games that build meaning by preconstruction and those that do so by reflection. We've largely defined the difference in terms of narativism vs. simulationism, and of confronting vs. celebrating. <br/><br/>Your post seems to be falling into a similar line of thought, and so I wish to question you on it. Are you saying that task resolution works better for games where you are celebrating the source material, emphasizing individual choice at the atomic level, and defining meaning as something that primarily comes from reflection after the fact rather than deliberate choices made before the moment?                        </div>

                            Well, I often seem to agree with John, so there's probaby something there. But I've never gotten the "celebration" language, and as far as confronting goes I could very well see--in fact do see--the possibility of using task resolution to challenge the ostensible source material. E.g., task resolution is often associated with "gritty" fantasy or even "peasants and pottage" in a fantasy world--referring to the fact that attempts at 'realistic' design-for-cause leads either to frequent bloody death for so-called heroes, or (the logical alternative) people who stay at home and avoid high-risk "adventuring".<br/>
<br/>
So I can't process the celebration vs. confrontation issue, but I am very much on board with the idea of TR as being appropriate to individual atomic choice and emergent meaning. Also with what in some forums has been called "experiential play" (or even "lyric play", with credit going to Jim Henley). At its extreme you may have "meaningless task checks" as in some actual Harnmaster play that John posted about in his livejournal, and which I dubbed as an effort to reproduce "the hiking experience" by forcing the players to not only work out the exact details of how their characters were going to traverse and investigate a bunch of pits, but also to roll dice to see if a character would fall even though the only consequence thereof was that the character would be saved by his rope and have to be pulled up again.<br/>
<br/>
You might also be able to connect this to my self evaluation in your MBTI post where I said something about looking at the game world as a laboratory.                        </div>

                            Elliot, <br/><br/>Celebration can be an odd term. Of course, it also depends on what you're celebrating and how... but I'll leave that off for now. <br/><br/>The rest I'll have to think on. I'm starting to really realize how well and truely I have no idea how Sim works.                        </div>
