If they're not, then they're not about story, they're about something else.<br/><br/>Could you ask me questions about this? I need people to ask questions like "Who wins, light or dark?" and "What about anti-heroes?" and "What about tragedies?".<br/><br/>I also need a few people* to say "Ah! What about this story, then? That doesn't fit your rigid structure, does it?". Then I will say "Actually it does, because of X". And we will argue for a while, until eventually I say "Oh, OK, that's an exception" and you WIN and I have useful information.<br/><br/>Anyway, please do ask questions, because it'll help me.

That's such a perfect example. Thank you.<br><br>Here's the less convincing explanation first. We can see dark as confusion, light as revelation. The reason Romeo and Juliet die is because they're confused, impetuous, ignorant of what's happening (Juliet kills herself because she finds Romeo dead, but he's not). At the end, everything becomes clear, but it's too late.<br/><br/>Slightly more convincing explanation. Romeo and Juliet do get together at the end, but in the afterlife. That's surprisingly important. True love wins, even in death.<br/><br/>Most convincing explanation of all. The death of Romeo and Juliet ends the feud between the Montagues and Capulets. It's a superb triumph for light. The community is reunited. Light always wins.<br/><br/>Eric, I'm afraid I don't know those specific examples. I might possibly be talking about the Western tradition of storytelling. Have you got any examples of villains winning, black vs black or grey vs grey?<br/><br/>Also, could we slow down a little? I've got high hopes for this thread. I really want to get something out of it.<br/><br/>Graham                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P" title="Cedric P"><img alt="Cedric P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7180/opticnerve8s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P">Cedric P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249666/#Comment_249666" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-05T09:50:48+00:00" title="January  5, 2010  9:50AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2010 9:53AM by Cedric P.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Old World of Darkness: darkness win in the end?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249667/#Comment_249667" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-05T09:55:58+00:00" title="January  5, 2010  9:55AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2010 9:58AM by Eric.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about children's stories where there is no real conflict of any kind? For example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Neighbor_Totoro" rel="nofollow">My Neighbor Totoro</a> has no dark side whatsoever, just kids exploring the magic of the world. There's no meaningful conflict, nothing bad happens to anyone, and the ultimate result is to affirm the world <i>as it is</i>. As Roger Ebert  wrote (longer version in the linked article), "My Neighbor Totoro is based on experience, situation and exploration\u2014not on conflict and threat... It is also rich with human comedy in the way it observes the two remarkably convincing, lifelike little girls... It is a little sad, a little scary, a little surprising and a little informative, just like life itself. It depends on a situation instead of a plot, and suggests that the wonder of life and the resources of imagination supply all the adventure you need."<br/><br/>There's a whole genre of children's stories that work this way. Don't they all violate your framework on the basic level of your framework requiring conflict and sides?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249670/#Comment_249670" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-05T10:05:36+00:00" title="January  5, 2010 10:05AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2010 10:09AM by Graham.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eric, could you give me another example of a children's story like that? There must be one, but I can't think of it. Alice in Wonderland, maybe? I don't really know Japanese stuff, so I don't know the story you linked to. And it's quite possible that everything I'm saying only concerns Western stories.<br/><br/>Cedric, the World of Darkness is a nice example, but not really too hard. Vampires (for example) were always beasts at heart. That idea ran right through the game. Even the Camarilla were constantly battling against losing their humanity.<br/><br/>So Vampires weren't the forces of light. They were more tragic: like Macbeth, the light and dark forces battled within them, and the dark would inevitably win. So they're dark and, of course, they had to die. Dark always dies.

I've always taken that ending to be about what happens when vengeance is more important than good. An initial assassination leads to <em>everyone</em> assassinated (or having committed suicide). And you insulted your mom. Good job, Prince-o.</p>\n<p>In The Mountain Witch and the ghost stories it comes from (see Kwaidan), it's hard to imagine what "Light triumphs" even means. It's suffering adding to suffering. And I think that's why we see a lot of Japanese examples and not so many Euro ones: in the Christian morality that dominates European thought, meekness is good. Being trampled and made to suffer shows your piety and moral rectitude. In Buddhist morality, unless you find a way out of suffering, you inflict suffering on others. Hence, ghost stories where the horrible specter is a  victim of murder or rape.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Grimm's Fairy Tales (many of which probably stem from a pre-Christian era anyway) have a distinct lack of recognizable morality, other than, "The snooty guy gets what's coming to him" or "That guy who was poor but clever, got rich!"

With tragic stories, it gets rather murkier, because the light and the dark are <i>in the same person</i>. But once you've gone over to the dark side, you must die. Dark is banished, because light must win. <br/><br/>I tend to think Grimm is quite clear cut. Cinderella, the light figure, becomes queen, while the dark Sisters get their eyes pecked out. Red Riding Hood lives, while the wolf dies. Snow White becomes queen, while the wicked stepmother is forced to dance in red-hot shoes until she falls down dead. The morality is questionable, but the light figures (the ones the story sees as good) win and the dark ones are punished.<br/><br/>With Japanese ghost stories, you probably win. I've played the Mountain Witch, but only once, and don't know it well enough to say much. It's entirely probable that everything I say comes from a Western and Christian tradition. I'm deliberately not trying to apply the idea to non-Western stories, because what I'll do, inevitably, is <i>interpret</i> those stories from a Western perspective, and that'll go very wrong.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249692/#Comment_249692" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-05T11:42:54+00:00" title="January  5, 2010 11:42AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Here's the less convincing explanation first. We can see dark as confusion, light as revelation. The reason Romeo and Juliet die is because they're confused, impetuous, ignorant of what's happening (Juliet kills herself because she finds Romeo dead, but he's not). At the end, everything becomes clear, but it's too late.</blockquote>\nAnother way to think of it is that we think of light = order; dark = chaos. It would be difficult -- and probably unpopular -- to end a story without the establishment of some kind of ordered status, whether that be the pre-story status quo, or some new, presumably 'improved" order. And the human mind being what it is, we tend to attach positive values to the survivors of stories. Winners write history, and myth-building favours winners.<br/><br/>As far as examples of gray vs. gray or dark vs. dark or dark wins, how about the films <i><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375912/" rel="nofollow">Layer Cake</a></i> and <i><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407887/" rel="nofollow">The Departed</a></i>. <br/><br/>SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW (select text to read)<br/><br/><span style="color: #FFFFFF;"> In the former, all of the major characters are murderers, gangsters, and generally bad people, and yet by virtue of the fact that one of them is made our POV character, we still tend to think of him as "light" and so his victory is theoretically a "light victory". He's clearly not a good guy (and depending on your interpretation of the ending, might not even have victory), so that might be one. In the latter, there is a set of traditionally "light" characters, foremost being Dicaprio's character. Yet despite the defeat and death of the Nicholson role, and the posthumous honouring of Dicaprio's sacrifice, criminal activity continues, the FBI lose a valuable informant, Wahlberg's character quits the force and commits murder, Sheen's character is dead; arguably, nobody "wins" at all.</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249695/#Comment_249695" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-05T11:51:52+00:00" title="January  5, 2010 11:51AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me define my terms a bit, before someone accuses me of cheating.<br/><br/>The dark forces are most importantly <b>selfish, power-grasping, greedy and uncaring</b>. They are usually described as some combination of dark, ugly, bad-smelling, hidden, disguised, confusing, unnatural, deathly and sharp/jagged in shape.<br/><br/>The light side, by contrast, is <b>selfless, giving and caring</b>. They are usually described as light, beautiful, pleasant, open, straightforward, natural, life-bringing and straight or curved in shape.<br/><br/>In heroic epics, the two sides are embodied by distinct characters. In more complex stories, they can appear in the same person: so the hero struggles with a light and a dark side. If the dark side wins, the hero suffers a bad ending, probably death. If the light side wins, the hero has a happy ending.<br/><br/>The ideas come from Christopher Booker's The Seven Basic Plots, which is very long and quite good.

I could analyse them, but I'd inevitably do so from a Western perspective. Christopher Booker does break down Lolita in this way, but since he's British and so am I, the conclusions will be pretty suspect.<br/><br/>As we get into the 20th Century, the theory breaks down. Often, there are stories that are <i>consciously</i> written to break with tradition. Sometimes, you can argue for glimmers of hope in the end, but it's not always possible. So with American Psycho and Chinatown, You Win, and so does anyone who says 1984.

I think this also eliminates, say, The Epic Of Gilgamesh, being from Babylon and thus from a precursor culture to western Europe. It seems like we're limiting ourselves to works from cultures and eras in which the dominate ideology was one of duality, of light vs. darkness, in which case the deck is stacked. Of course, seeing if you can win against a stacked deck is still a potentially useful exercise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249721/#Comment_249721" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-05T13:09:28+00:00" title="January  5, 2010  1:09PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" - the "bad guy" gets the girl.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249722/#Comment_249722" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-05T13:17:44+00:00" title="January  5, 2010  1:17PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2010 1:33PM by Eric.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From the Greeks: The Odyssey. While Odysseus was heroic by the standards of his time and culture, he violates all of Graham's standards for Light - as well as the model of Christopher Booker, despite Booker's rather embarrassing attempt to shoehorn the story into his model. Odysseus whores and schemes his way back home, massacres a ton of guys, and then gets rewarded by Athena. Remember that his final victory over the suitors involved a great deal of treachery, scheming, and <i>slaughtering the unarmed.</i> He is an amoral schemer or morally reprobate time and time again, at least by the standards of Light, and he is presented as finding victory as a result of those qualities. He doesn't even accept negotiation or attempts to surrender. \n<blockquote>"If you are Ulysses," said he, "then what you have said is just. We have done much wrong on your lands and in your house. But Antinous who was the head and front of the offending lies low already. It was all his doing. It was not that he wanted to marry Penelope; he did not so much care about that; what he wanted was something quite different, and Jove has not vouchsafed it to him; he wanted to kill your son and to be chief man in Ithaca. Now, therefore, that he has met the death which was his due, spare the lives of your people. We will make everything good among ourselves, and pay you in full for all that we have eaten and drunk. Each one of us shall pay you a fine worth twenty oxen, and we will keep on giving you gold and bronze till your heart is softened. Until we have done this no one can complain of your being enraged against us."<br/><br/>Ulysses again glared at him and said, "Though you should give me all that you have in the world both now and all that you ever shall have, I will not stay my hand till I have paid all of you in full. You must fight, or fly for your lives; and fly, not a man of you shall."<br/><br/>Their hearts sank as they heard him, but Eurymachus again spoke saying:<br/><br/>"My friends, this man will give us no quarter. He will stand where he is and shoot us down till he has killed every man among us. Let us then show fight; draw your swords, and hold up the tables to shield you from his arrows. Let us have at him with a rush, to drive him from the pavement and doorway: we can then get through into the town, and raise such an alarm as shall soon stay his shooting."</blockquote>Note that the primary goal of the "bad guys" is to simply get outside and raise the alarm so the murderous lunatic stops shooting. The primary goal of the "good guy" in this exchange is to slaughter them all even when they want to surrender <i>and pay reparations until Odysseus is satisfied.</i><br/><br/>If Light and Dark are just to mean Winners and Losers, then it fits. Otherwise, violating Graham's model is older than Rome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P" title="Cedric P"><img alt="Cedric P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7180/opticnerve8s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P">Cedric P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249723/#Comment_249723" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-05T13:28:27+00:00" title="January  5, 2010  1:28PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is their a example where light win over darkness by destroying/banishing it but that in the end darkness win because in the process light became twisted, corrupted, harsher, broken, tainted, etc (well, simply more dark) ?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249729/#Comment_249729" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-05T13:49:03+00:00" title="January  5, 2010  1:49PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Slow down, guys, slow down.

Sure, the protagonist is an anti-hero, who pretends to be a cancer victim. But it quickly becomes about light and dark. Our hero enters a dark world, which, at first, seems attractive. But then his friend, Tyler, becomes darker and deceptive. Eventually, the protagonist confronts Tyler and defeats him. (As it happens, Tyler's an aspect of his split personality, but that's a twist, not a break with the story). Dark is defeated; light wins.<br/><br/>As a final twist, some buildings blow up. It darkens our hero somewhat, but not too much: they're only corporate buildings, after all. There still seems to be a light-and-dark theme, running through the film.<br/><br/>American Beauty does something similar. There's a sense of anarchy, but not too much. The hero is tempted to seduce a cheerleader, but doesn't. Because he doesn't, he has a happy ending. Now, actually, he dies, but that's OK: the voiceover tells us he's happy.<br/><br/>Collateral, as I remember, is pretty clear-cut. There's a bad hitman and a heroic taxi-driver. At the end, the hero defeats the bad guy. <br/><br/>I think those are interesting variations, but I don't think I'm stretching too much with those descriptions. There's a sense of inevitability. The protagonist in Fight Club <i>had</i> to defeat Tyler Durden; the protagonist in American Beauty <i>couldn't</i> have seduced the cheerleader.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249747/#Comment_249747" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-05T16:27:23+00:00" title="January  5, 2010  4:27PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2010 4:32PM by Graham.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Waiting For Godot: You Win.

It fits the tragic pattern. The central character is <i>completely</i> driven by ego, especially vanity, so he's a dark figure. Hence, he's got to lose. The community is driven by ego, too, obsessed with pleasure and socialising, so it's a dark community. So they've got to lose, too, and they do: they lose one of their prettiest daughters. Everyone's dark and they get what they deserve. If anyone had been genuinely in love, they would have survived.<br/><br/>To Build A Fire is interesting. The protagonist meets the Wise Old Man, who's a very common figure (c.f. Gandalf, Obi-Wan Kenobi). The Wise Old Man gives him advice on getting through the snow. At first, the protagonist follows the advice. Later, however, it emerges he's ignored key things: he's travelled alone; he's built the fire under a tree. So he dies.<br/><br/>But, as in American Beauty, it's a happy death. He dies comfortably. In his final moments, he reconciles himself with the Wise Old Man, in a vision. Everything becomes clear. And the last image is one of life: the dog, trotting up the hill, in search of food. The protagonist dies, but Light triumphs.<br/><br/>Again, it's interesting to reverse things. It would be curiously unsatisfying if Ichabod Crane had married the girl: perhaps, if he'd stopped being vain, it might have been more satisfying. Similarly, it would have been unsatisfying if the fire-building protagonist had died horribly. As a light figure, who hadn't turned entirely to the dark, he needed a happy death. Even then, we need the idea that the dog lives on. It makes everything OK, somehow.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249748/#Comment_249748" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-05T16:27:49+00:00" title="January  5, 2010  4:27PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Joshua phrased it much better than I did.</blockquote>\nHe certainly didn't say good guys winning is a Western idea that doesn't really apply to other cultures.

So, light doesn't really win in FC -- it's a slightly less-dark darkness, or at least a mixture of light and dark.<br/><br/>It's like what Benjamin Franklin said centuries ago. He was writing about his self-improvement campaign, which he never really finished, and likened it to a man who, noticing how shiny the sharpened edge on his ax is, decides to grind the entire ax so that it's all that shiny. He works on it for a long time, but eventually gives up while there's only speckles of shiny, saying, "A speckled ax is best."<br/><br/>Also worth noting is that in the book version of FC, the bomb doesn't go off at the end. Because the narrator used paraffin to make the dynamite, accidentally on purpose, and he never could get paraffin to work right.

Sure, the protagonist is an anti-hero, who pretends to be a cancer victim. But it quickly becomes about light and dark. Our hero enters a dark world, which, at first, seems attractive. But then his friend, Tyler, becomes darker and deceptive. Eventually, the protagonist confronts Tyler and defeats him. (As it happens, Tyler's an aspect of his split personality, but that's a twist, not a break with the story). Dark is defeated; light wins.</blockquote>\nIt seems more to the movie's point that both represent very conflicted mixtures of "dark" and "light" (if we must use such terms!). You've already noted some of the deceptions that make "Jack" an anti-hero, but more importantly, he won't actually do anything to change his situation. Tyler espouses some very good ideas (hence, why he gets quoted so much), but ultimately proves <em>so</em> willing to do something to change his situation, that he crosses lines that you shouldn't. It seems to me less a story about "light" vs. "dark," than a character finding a balance between extremes (of resignation vs zealotry).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>American Beauty does something similar.

I'd call it a story about liberation, but that plays pretty well into a "light vs. darkness" mold.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Collateral, as I remember, is pretty clear-cut. There's a bad hitman and a heroic taxi-driver. At the end, the hero defeats the bad guy.</blockquote>\nThe hitman is clearly a sociopath, but it's not entirely clear that he's "the darkness," either. He challenges the taxi driver with a yawning nihilism that he can't easily refute. He says he's "taking out the trash," and while he later reveals he doesn't really give a damn about such things, he does spend the movie killing drug dealers and criminals.<br/><br/>The taxi driver doesn't stand out as particularly heroic--at least, not at first. Like "Jack" in Fight Club, he lacks the strength to change his situation. He's driven a taxi cab for twelve years while dreaming of owning his own company as a limousine chauffeur--which is why the hitman chooses him. He has shown that he will never actually pursue his dream, so if he dies, it means nothing; he stopped living long ago. In the face of the hitman's nihilism, the taxi driver rises to the challenge to begin living again. The hitman keeps stressing adaptation: "Darwin, I Ching, whatever man, we gotta roll with it." Yet in the end, it's his strict adherence to his shot pattern (double tap to the chest, one to the head) that the taxi driver exploits to win the fight.<br/><br/>This isn't about "light vs. darkness," at least, not in any moral sense.

The main character is all light or all dark <i>before</i>, a man divided. He spends most of the movie as caring <i>or</i> callous, warm <i>or</i> cold. He wins, if at all, by accepting and integrating the darkness and light together - melding Jack and Tyler. If there is a happy ending here, it is found in transcendence of light and darkness rather than light overcoming darkness. <br/><br/>Edit: On a related note, one of my favorite video games moments ever is in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Pucelle:_Tactics" rel="nofollow">La Pucelle.</a> The young princess Eclair tries to act perfectly, rejecting any negativity or rancor, but the stress of the situation weighs so heavily upon her that it creates a split personality - Dark Eclair, a floating magical girl in leather. Eventually, you fight Dark Eclair. In Graham's construction, you would destroy this aspect of darkness that is making trouble. In the actual game, you win by re-integrating it back into Eclair. Eclair realizes that the negative emotions she had repressed are a part of her, too, normal and healthy, and she must embrace them to be whole - she must embrace the darkness within her. From then on, she can switch between "light" princess form and "dark" magical girl form at will, and works to strike a balance between these aspects of her throughout her life. Upon doing so, she also is able to advance her romance with Homard, another character, thus indicating her transition to maturity as a result of this acceptance of herself. <br/><br/>Marshall: I particularly like the Ben Franklin tie-in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249756/#Comment_249756" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-05T17:02:25+00:00" title="January  5, 2010  5:02PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy#Theories_of_tragedy" rel="nofollow">Greek tragedy</a> doesn't fit your model. Says Wikipedia:\n<blockquote>The philosopher Aristotle said in his work Poetics that tragedy is characterized by seriousness and dignity and involving a great person who experiences a reversal of fortune (Peripeteia). ... Tragedy results in a catharsis (emotional cleansing) or healing for the audience through their experience of these emotions in response to the suffering of the characters in the drama.<br/>...This reversal of fortune must be caused by the tragic hero's hamartia, which is often mistranslated as a character flaw, but is more correctly translated as a mistake ... According to Aristotle, "The change to bad fortune which he undergoes is not due to any moral defect or flaw, but a mistake of some kind." The reversal is the inevitable but unforeseen result of some action taken by the hero.</blockquote>\nHence, the ending of Greek tragedy doesn't represent any kind of triumph by anyone, regardless of what one thinks of the hero. The point isn't that his actions were punished, but that what happened to him could happen to anyone.<br/><br/>More recently, looks like no one's mentioned Camus's "The Stranger".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249759/#Comment_249759" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-05T17:16:49+00:00" title="January  5, 2010  5:16PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>With anything written before the 20th Century, you'll find it very difficult to find a counter-example.</blockquote>\nJeckyll and Hyde?

Yes, learning is a thing, I think.<br/><br/>Lost In Translation follows the pattern of a romantic comedy. So you've got two light figures and, to win, they need to get together. But they can't, because the darker forces are keeping them apart. The darker forces are less tangible, here: it's about confusion and misinterpretion of motives. Only at the end do the couple see clearly and get together. (And then there's a twist, because they don't actually <i>get together</i>, but the movie ends with a moment of union).<br/><br/>I'm sort of aware how different that sounds to the other explanations. You have to go off in a different direction to do romantic stories. Once you do, though, there are big patterns within them.<br/><br/>The Jerk is a rags-to-riches story. Because the guy is basically good, he triumphs at the end. There's some dark stuff to overcome on the way and a bit of romantic comedy.<br/><br/>Black Hawk Down is more problematic, I think.

Job submits, not to his "better nature" as Graham presents it, but for its own sake - he is not competent to call Yahweh to task. Even if Job has clearly been wronged by the standards of Light vs. Dark, he can only pour ashes on his head when confronted with such force beyond human judgment and human morality. Only when he abandons all attempt to judge actions or to advocate for the "selfless, giving and caring" and debases himself does Yahweh relent - only after he abandons the Light that he has been clinging to are his fortunes restored.<br><br>Or, more simply: in the Book of Job, the divine transcends light and dark.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249800/#Comment_249800" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-06T03:03:44+00:00" title="January  6, 2010  3:03AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 6, 2010 3:04AM by Graham.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

Thanks for extending that perspective.<br/><br/>---------------------------------------<br/><br/>How about that eternal art of the short story, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joke" rel="nofollow">joke</a>? You've got <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_jokes" rel="nofollow">Roman jokes,</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philogelos" rel="nofollow">for example</a>, that seem quite familiar to a 21st century audience. The rules of humor differ from culture to culture, but I don't think we can really find Light defeating Dark in these Roman classics:<br/><br/>An Abderite followed custom and cremated his dead father. He ran home and said to his ailing mother: "There are a few fire-logs still left. If you want to stop suffering, get yourself cremated on them." <br/><br/>Someone needled a jokester: "I had your wife, without paying a dime."

One woman (#1) said: "My Lord, this woman and I dwell in the same house, and I gave birth to a child while with her in the house. On the third day after I gave birth, she also gave birth. We live together; there is no outsider with us in the house; only the two of us were there. The son of this woman died during the night because she lay upon him. She arose during the night and took my son from my side while I was asleep, and lay him in her bosom, and her dead son she laid in my bosom. when I got up in the morning to nurse my son, behold, he was dead! But when I observed him (later on) in the morning, I realized that he was not my son to whom I had given birth!"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other woman (#2) replied: "It is not so! My son is the live one and your son is the dead one!"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first woman (#1) responded: "It is not so! Your son is the dead one and my son is the living one!"<br/>\n<br/>\nThey argued before King Solomon.<br/>\n<br/>\nKing Solomon said: "this woman (#2) claims 'My son is the live one and your son is the dead one, 'and this woman (#1) claims 'Your son is the dead one and my son is the living one!"'<br/>\n<br/>\nKing Solomon said, "Bring me a sword!" So they brought a sword before the King. The King said, "Cut the living child in two, and give half to one and half to the other"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe woman (#2) turned to the King, because her compassion was aroused for her son, and said: "Please my Lord, give her the living child and do not kill it!"<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the other woman (#1) said: "Neither mine nor yours shall he be. Cut!"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe King spoke up and said: "Give her (#2) the living child, and do not kill it, for she is his mother!" All of Israel heard the judgment that the King had judged. They had great awe for the King, for they saw that the wisdom of God was within him to do justice. [I Melachim 3:16 - 27]. The woman was rightfully awarded custody of her son.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there films or games in this path?

It depends what you mean by "The Story of Seinfeld", right?<br><br>Here's mine: throughout the running of the show, we see the actions of self-centred, venal characters*, who are very successful at making themselves miserable/driving themselves crazy. Many of the situations they seem to be in are ones that are superficial or involve unpleasantness. One way to take this is that well, life is pretty unsympathetic, and really, the cast are just reacting rationally to a grey world. But this isn't satisfying; these are financially comfortable, well connected people, living with no real challenges who still fail to have much of a good time (contrast them with eg the cast of Friends, who, although they suffer, are nice people and generally are happy). Plus some of their actions are clearly so reprehensible it's hard to see them as pragmatic.<br><br>next para spoiler-proofed:<br>So characters, full of themselves, empty of others, end up creating a world that reflects their internal states, and when they encounter light they force it out their world, which keeps them comfortable. In the final episode, they are literally called to account for all their sins - we are replayed countless episodes from their lives in which they have Chosen The Dark Side. And it's pretty clear to us that these aren't cherry picked, there are plenty more. And as a consequence, they are taken out of society, and consigned to a place, indefinitely with just each other.

Flow and media enjoyment. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Communication Theory, 14</span>(4), 328-347.</cite>Some story traditions become so common that writers begin to parody or write against the form. For example, after years of film westerns with clearly good guys (with white hats) and bad guys (black hats), the 1970s saw the introduction of writing against type, such as the protagonist bad guys in <i>The Wild Bunch</i> or <i>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</i> or parodies of simplistic western formula in films such as <i>Blazing Saddles</i>. Trite stories lack the ability to engage the viewer because there is no challenge in discerning the plot twists or character culpability in the story.</blockquote>\nThis suggests to me that beyond the simple structural formulation of Light vs. Dark may be required (a) a theory of reading, in which authors and audiences are both expected to be familiar with some narrative conventions and unfamiliar with others, and (b) a theory of genre, in which the "intertextuality" or recursiveness of narrative is acknowledged; i.e., some stories are about (in response to) other stories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249867/#Comment_249867" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-06T17:02:14+00:00" title="January  6, 2010  5:02PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 6, 2010 5:04PM by Graham.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With comedies, the "darkness" is about confusion, rather than evil.

Any arbitrary ideological scheme - Marxism, Eco-Feminism, Libertarianism, anything - can be shown to provide a structure that all narratives fit into. That's why they're seductive and powerful, because it's hard to see the trick of the mind that seduces you. See, for example, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Critical-Theory-Today-User-Friendly-Humanities/dp/0815328796" rel="nofollow">Critical Theory Today</a>. The author takes ten ideological perspectives, ranging from Freudian psychoanalysis to Marxism to Postcolonialism, and shows how "The Great Gatsby" fits each one <i>perfectly</i>.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Like all story structures, it's a way to see stories from a different perspective. You see how far the stories fit the structure. By seeing the stories in a different way, you learn new things about them.</blockquote>\nThis is the right idea, but you need to keep going. They're always going to fit - you, the reader, make them fit using what you bring to the table. The only difference between "getting them to fit" and "showing how they fit" is the self-consciousness involved in the action. This practice of analysis provides insight into the self and into one's cultural perspective, first and foremost. You're absolutely correct to be wary about imposing your cultural viewpoint on The Odyssey or east Asian ghost stories, but keep going. The power that you see in this structure is the power it has to resonate within you, to be relevant to your experiences and cultural perspective. <br/><br/>A Buddhist monk from Thailand is likely going to regard Booker's model as pure kindergarten stuff, dualistic nonsense, and a sociologist might snicker at it as a hoary chestnut rehashed from the bad old days, but that's only a problem if you want it to be <i>true</i>. True like gravity or like love. If you just want something useful and interesting, then you're golden.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249900/#Comment_249900" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-07T02:36:47+00:00" title="January  7, 2010  2:36AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2010 2:39AM by Graham.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eric: Yes, absolutely.

If in some instances the principle is upheld and in others violated, you can't tell as a reader if the violation signals the author's ignorant lack of craft or her membership in a different interpretive community; similarly, as an author, if you have been taught that "The Light Always Wins," then your craft is impaired, since you can make the Light lose if you want, if you think that's what your story needs. Booker's model strikes me as so tendentious as to be obviously the work of a crank interested in Broad Strokes and Simple Straight Answers rather than real understanding. Far better to take it and incorporate the feedback that's emerged here to turn it into something like, "The disposition of a character at the end of a story is a normative judgment about the values he or she embodies."

It's worth doing that, before dismissing it as the work of a crank. It's well-written and nuanced. It looks for patterns, rather than imposing a structure, and acknowledges where the patterns break down. (Well, for the first part of the book, anyway. Towards the end, it gets slightly mad.)<br/><br/>Here's what I think. Booker's theory is pretty good at spotting patterns in a particular sort of story. Those are the sorts of stories we often play in roleplaying games.<br/><br/>In particular, I think Booker's ideas capture things we've lost in roleplaying games: for example, the idea that heroes are heroic, rather than just hacking their way through a dungeon. There's a sense of numinosity, which I also think we've lost, and which this story structure highlights. Of course, the structure has its limits, but it makes some good points along the way.<br/><br/>Importantly, I don't think it's useful to use the structure <i>prescriptively</i>. There's no way we should sit, in a roleplaying game, going "Right, it's time for the light side to triumph". It's background information, not, as you say, a guideline for practice.<br/><br/>The stuff about values and normative judgements is probably true. However, I'm not so interested in it, in this context, beyond noting that Booker's ideas are obviously rooted in modern Western culture. If you are, though, then cool. Here's a question back at you, perhaps for another thread. How can your ideas about normative judgements and values make roleplaying games better?

But I'm working on it.\n<blockquote><cite>from a paper I'm working on, to be called "Playing House in a World of Night"</cite>This analysis examines a session of RPG play at a gaming convention as an instance of \u201ccritical play,\u201d in Flanagan\u2019s (2009) sense of an activity that challenges received notions of culture and social identity. Specifically, it looks at how specific \u201cincorporative discourse strategies\u201d (Hendricks, 2006) are used in a small-press tabletop fantasy roleplaying game to enact gender in ways that play with and play against ideas of masculinity, femininity, and domestic male-female relations. It focuses in particular on the language use associated with in-game enactments of masculinity, and attempts to trace for the three male characters in the game their different narrative trajectories within a semantic rectangle of certain salient cultural ideals of American masculinity: manly respectability, rough virility, boyish playfulness, and sensitive manhood (Pfeil, 1995; Schut, 2006). By paying particular attention to the ways in which players achieve ironic or authorial distance (Bakhtin, 1990) from their characters, this analysis opens up a discussion on the nature of role-playing as performance (Mackay, 2001), as sub-culture (Barrowcliffe, 2007; Fine, 1983) and as medium (Wardrip-Fruin &amp; Harrigan, 2007).</blockquote>\nI'll let you know what I find out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/LaughingJackWilton" title="LaughingJackWilton"><img alt="LaughingJackWilton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/LaughingJackWilton">LaughingJackWilton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249929/#Comment_249929" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-07T08:49:09+00:00" title="January  7, 2010  8:49AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2010 8:51AM by LaughingJackWilton.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A problem with this whole argument is that it is all about interpretation. The concept of the conflict between good and evil (light and darkness) is a primarily Jud\xe6o-Christian belief today. If you wanted to, you could always find a 'light' in a story; either enlightenment or something good coming from a conflict.<br/>\nMany older stories from other influences such as Norse and old Greek have nothing to do with light and darkness. The Iliad and Odyssey are not about good and evil. It is about heroes (people who do great things) either fighting in a war or trying to get home. There is no 'light' side. In the Iliad the deities choose their sides and support whoever. In the Odyssey stuff just happens and Odysseus gets through it. <br/>\nIn Norse tales it is again about heroes doing heroic things, yet there is a conflict between order and chaos, this is different than light and darkness. Both sides commit morally gray acts. This does not apply to Beowulf, because it was written by Christians and includes Jud\xe6o-Christian mythology.<br/>\nIn the modern world, there are protagonists and antagonists. The protagonist is not always light/good. Lolita is a book where, quite frankly, light/good does not 'win'. That is not what the novel is about.<br/>\nThere are many narratives that work with a good and evil axis. In those narratives good does win a fair amount.<br/>\nSince RPGs are a type of narrative, I would agree that a lot of games work on a good and evil axis. There are genres of narratives that do not work on that axis because it is not what the story is about. In Neuromancer Case achieves his goal. Does that mean light wins? No, the genre is cyberpunk and it is all shades of gray. Case's goodness has nothing to do with his success.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn conclusion, the reader may analyze a narrative subjectively and see it under their own terms.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lakira" title="Lakira"><img alt="Lakira" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lakira">Lakira</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249948/#Comment_249948" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-07T10:15:34+00:00" title="January  7, 2010 10:15AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2010 10:16AM by Lakira.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: LaughingJackWilton</cite>A problem with this whole argument is that it is all about interpretation. <br/><br/><br/><br/>In conclusion, the reader may analyze a narrative subjectively and see it under their own terms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric</cite>See, for example,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Critical-Theory-Today-User-Friendly-Humanities/dp/0815328796" rel="nofollow">Critical Theory Today</a>.

Thus far, it looks like the fact that "stories can be interpreted any which way, even if you have to stretch" is a <i>flaw</i>. From the perspective of the Light Wins theory, this is true. From a "can I use this?" perspective, it <i>isn't</i>.<br/><br/>Like so:<br/><br/>Graham has declared "You Win, Of Course" to a few specific examples and refrained from interpreting others which come out of a different cultural background. So, what is it about those few specific examples that make them "You Win, Of Course"? I don't mean specific plot events or what not. I mean, why is it a stretch to make them fit the "Light Wins" model? What makes your gut go "Nope, can't do it in a way that I feel is justified." <br/><br/>There are some borderline cases where Graham's interpretation through the "Light Wins" model isn't being accepted by some people. Why? What do you feel in your gut makes them not fit? Is it the same stuff that made Graham go "You Win, Of Course" with other examples? If so, how was Graham able to justify a response other than "You Win, Of Course" with these borderline cases? What <i>thing</i> changes the whole? <br/><br/>More relevant to RPGs:<br/><br/>You're playing in a game. Your character dies. Did you win? Did the Light win? Did the Dark win?

They are usually described as some combination of dark, ugly, bad-smelling, hidden, disguised, confusing, unnatural, deathly and sharp/jagged in shape.<br/><br/>The light side, by contrast, is<b>selfless, giving and caring</b>. They are usually described as light, beautiful, pleasant, open, straightforward, natural, life-bringing and straight or curved in shape.<br/><br/>In heroic epics, the two sides are embodied by distinct characters. In more complex stories, they can appear in the same person: so the hero struggles with a light and a dark side. If the dark side wins, the hero suffers a bad ending, probably death. If the light side wins, the hero has a happy ending.<br/><br/>The ideas come from Christopher Booker's The Seven Basic Plots, which is very long and quite good. It's better at the start than the end.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249950/#Comment_249950" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-07T10:29:18+00:00" title="January  7, 2010 10:29AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apologies for coming late to this discussion.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric</cite>While Odysseus was heroic by the standards of his time and culture, he violates all of Graham's standards for Light - as well as the model of Christopher Booker, despite Booker's rather embarrassing attempt to shoehorn the story into his model.</blockquote>\nIsn't The Odyssey, like many Euraisan myths, about the restoration of community?  Light triumphs in the setting right of Odysseus\u2019 home, not in the actions of the individual.  This interpretation might be heavily influenced by Joseph Campbell.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>I think Fight Club <i>wants</i> to get away from black-and-white morality, but can't do it. Sure, the protagonist is an anti-hero, who pretends to be a cancer victim. But it quickly becomes about light and dark. Our hero enters a dark world, which, at first, seems attractive. But then his friend, Tyler, becomes darker and deceptive. Eventually, the protagonist confronts Tyler and defeats him. (As it happens, Tyler's an aspect of his split personality, but that's a twist, not a break with the story). Dark is defeated; light wins.</blockquote>\nFor better or worse, I\u2019m hooked into the Western vs. non-Western undercurrent in this thread.  Fight Club is about the destruction of the self, and therefore doesn\u2019t fall into the Zoroastrian dichotomy.  Or rather, if it does, the conflict is internal (between the narrator and Tyler).  The narrator triumphs in that he restores himself; in the end, both he and Tyler are aspects of the same individual.  The ultimate realization of this involves the narrator shooting himself in the face.  It\u2019s been too long since I\u2019ve seen this for me to be more direct in what I\u2019m saying.  Maybe this is light overcoming darkness, but the path to get to that point is very different than, I don\u2019t know, Star Wars or something.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>They were more tragic: like Macbeth, the light and dark forces battled within them, and the dark would inevitably win. So they're dark and, of course, they had to die. Dark always dies. Light always wins.</blockquote>\nGraham, are you familiar with Kurosawa\u2019s Throne of Blood and Ran?

I called it the <a href="http://www.princeofdarknessgames.com/projects/FUnnel%20Model.pdf" rel="nofollow">FUNnel Model</a><br/>Here's the bit on narrative - which speaks to the questions Graham asked above - how can we use these ideas in RPGs?\n<blockquote>Narrative: Once Upon a time<br/><br/>The earliest known story is the Sumerian epic of Gilgamesh, which survives today over 5000<br/>years after it was first told in Mesopotamia. Surprisingly the plot structure follows the formula for a Hollywood blockbuster. This is more than mere coincidence, it shows that humanity has a universal need for and appreciation of stories. Intuitively, who doesn't enjoy a good story?<br/><br/>In certain circles, there is much discussion of premise being the foundation of narrative.<br/>However, as Christopher Booker shows in his literary tour de force The Seven Basic Plots, there is in fact only one universal premise - Good vs Evil, Altruism vs Ego; Light vs Dark*.<br/><br/>This is further supported by briefly considering three of what are commonly termed Narrativist role-playing games: Ron Edward\u2019s Sorcerer, Vincent D Baker\u2019s Dogs in the Vineyard and Paul Czege\u2019s My Life with Master.<br/><br/>The heart of Sorcerer\u2019s premise is humanity - essentially how light or dark a character is.<br/><br/>Dogs\u2019 main narrative thrust is how far do you go for your vision of what is right - essentially when do you cross the line into darkness (the genius of this game is that it will often be the<br/>drawing of a gun which represents movement into darkness).<br/><br/>In MLWM the characters live under the shadow of the wholly dark master and only by performing enough good acts can they gain the power of light (represented as love) which allows them to overthrow the shackles of darkness.<br/><br/>Narrative enjoyment comes from the fulfilment of the universal plot structure - darkness sowing the seeds of its own destruction to be finally overthrown by light. Of course there are<br/>stories in which light does not triumph, the Dark Inversion as Booker calls it. Interestingly these stories have only been written within the last couple of centuries (or older ones simply do not survive as memes) and are less psychologically satisfying since they conflict with our intuitive moral values. Hence Hollywood\u2019s obsession with (the more bankable) happy endings.<br/><br/>This is also the problem with balancing gaming or exploration against narrative - it\u2019s all too possible that the dark powers will \u2018win\u2019.<br/><br/>* This is a vastly simplified synopsis of Booker\u2019s work. I implore anyone with an interest in the narrative form to invest the necessary time to read The Seven Basic Plots as it is the most important book on narrative ever written.<br/></blockquote>\nIn short good narrative oriented games already have the Light vs Dark struggle mechanised. If your fun is coming from gaming (competition), immersion or exploration then the light/dark conflict is less important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250031/#Comment_250031" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-08T04:27:57+00:00" title="January  8, 2010  4:27AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 8, 2010 4:29AM by Tulpa.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Wait, so is the premise of this thread serious?

As has been pointed out, it's all subjective. In Fight Club, you might see the destruction of the self, while I see a light-and-dark battle, a third person sees Freudian imagery and a fourth sees patriarchal privilege. None of those interpretations negates the other.<br/><br/>What's interesting, to me, whether you can make an effective argument that Fight Club supports each of those perspectives. You can't really argue that it contains themes of the decline of the British Empire or religious transcendence, but you can argue, I think, for any of the themes above.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11243/light-always-wins" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11243/light-always-wins" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11243/light-always-wins/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11243/light-always-wins/p3" rel="next">3</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11243/light-always-wins/p3" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F11243%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F11243%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Light always wins - Page 3 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11243/light-always-wins/p3" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Light always wins - Page 3" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11243/light-always-wins/p3" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Posted By: Joshua A.C.

I could dust off my copy and take a crack at a Postcolonialism reading of Fight Club, if you'd like.<br/><br/>The same theory might say that the "Cozy Apocalypse" genre in the U.K. is really expressing a white middle class English desire to return to the good old days when everyone else either knew their place or was put in their place.

I think that's where it should have been cut if you were going to make a completely binary truncation: chapter 21 and everything after.<br/><br/>So he's not <i>exactly</i> a crank. I accept the correction.<br/><br/>Seriously, though, I'm interested in structuralist accounts of narrative; one of the few scholarly successes I've achieved has been using Algirdas Greimas to read (English lit Ph.D.) Kim Stanley Robinson's <i>Red Mars</i>, which is a weird recursion, given that one of the characters in the trilogy uses Greimas's theory to analyze the other characters. Greimas extends Vladimir Propp's "morphology of the folktale" to come up with what he calls an "actantial model" in which characters are regarded as "actants" (functional roles) interacting with each other over their objects of desire, power, and communication. It's very neat, and I have notes for a game that uses those actantial roles game-mechanically to shape the fiction.<br/><br/>Greimas is a hard slog, but I'm making it sound more complicated than it is. <br/><br/><code>Sender ---&gt; Object ---&gt; Receiver<br/>              ^<br/>              |<br/>Helper ---&gt;  Hero  &lt;--- Opponent </code><br/><br/>The hero wants or needs an object that is also a kind of message between some sender and receiver; he is aided and opposed by other actants (some of which may be internal to the hero). So, for example, Luke [hero] wants to "become a Jedi" [object], aided by Ben Kenobi and Yoda and everyone else and opposed by Darth Vader and the Emperor and his own susceptibility to the Dark Side. In a larger sense, though, "becoming a Jedi" though is also a signal to the people of the Galaxy [receiver] from the numinous Force [sender] about the overthrow of the corrupt order of the Empire and the restoration of peace in the Galaxy, which is why we celebrate and sing "Yub yub."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11243/light-always-wins/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11243/light-always-wins">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11243/light-always-wins/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11243/light-always-wins/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F11243%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F11243%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
