Will you be there? Do you dare to have that much fun?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere will be an Indie Games Explosion at DEXCON. Dozens and dozens of the most blisteringly awesome independent games will be run at the con.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, the Explosion needs your help! We need you to come to the con and play games. We need you to come to the con and RUN games! Here\u2019s how:<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Come and play</b><br/>\nIf you just want to come to Morristown and have a blast, here\u2019s how you can help make the Explosion great:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Go to <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://dexposure.com/dexcon14i.html" rel="nofollow">the registration page</a> and pre-register for the con.<br/>\n2) Watch this thread for announcements of what events people are planning to run.<br/>\n3) When the official schedule is up, around June 27 to June 29, register for the games you want to play.<br/>\n4) Come to Morristown and bring your A-game!<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Come and run</b><br/>\nThe nitroglycerin at the heart of every Indie Games Explosion are all the great folks who come out with a game in hand, ready to rock the house. If you\u2019ve got a game session in your soul, burning to get out, here\u2019s how you can help:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Post your event description here, or on your blog, or wherever the kids are chattering these days. Get people excited about your game.<br/>\n2) Send an e-mail to the IGE <b>gmail </b>account: <b>indiegamesexplosion</b> At that point, Kat will send you a Google document that contains all the information we need from you in order to officially register the event. Fill it out and return it BEFORE May 15, 2011.<br/>\n3) If you run at least three events, you will receive a GM badge to the convention. At some point in June, we will send you a code you can use on the registration page.<br/>\n4) When the official schedule is up, around June 27 to June 29, register for the games you want to play.<br/>\n5) Come to Morristown and revel!<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>A Note on Small Events</b><br/>\nGames sessions for 4 players are a bit of a sticky situation. On the one hand, they take up an entire table for an entire gaming slot while only entertaining a few people. On the other hand, some of the best indie games are only built for 4 and create less fun for everybody if expanded. It\u2019s a pickle.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought Dreamation went pretty well, so I'm going to do the same thing. I\u2019m going to ask you to consider running sessions for 5 or 6 players. By \u201cconsider,\u201d I don\u2019t mean \u201cyou must\u201d or \u201cyou should\u201d or \u201cyou will be shunned unless.\u201d I simply mean \u201cthink about it.\u201d Step away from the Internet for a moment, look at your game shelf, and ask yourself if you have a 5 or 6 player game you\u2019ve been wanting to run. Can you stretch your abilities in that direction? Do you want to? Can you run Game A for 6 players in addition to running Game B for 4 players?<br/>\n<br/>\nI can\u2019t answer those questions. I\u2019d just like you to answer them for yourself and your own situation. If the answer is \u201cI want to run a bunch of 4 player games,\u201d then that\u2019s great and we want you on-board for the Explosion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Playtests</b><br/>\nWhile DEXCON can certainly host playtests, and has done so very successfully in the past, this year will see the dawn of <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://dexposure.com/m2011.html" rel="nofollow">METATOPIA</a>, a convention devoted completely to playtesting. If your game is ready, submit it with the word "playtest" in the description. If it still has some kinks, I'd suggest holding off until November.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Assorted Other Stuff</b><br/>\nWe have in the past held an Indie Games Roundtable on Sunday to discuss games in development and other matters. Is there anyone willing to facilitate it?<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019m posting this on Story Games, but there\u2019s probably other places on the Internet that might want to get involved. If you know of such a place, please invite them to participate. The more, the merrier.<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of the above is set in stone. If you\u2019ve got suggestions, I want to hear them. Kat and I will be doing our best to monitor these threads for questions and the like. However, if we haven\u2019t responded in timely fashion, please e-mail the indiegamesexplosion address with a link to the question. Thanks for your help.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee you in July!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zipht" title="zipht"><img alt="zipht" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/173668_1770784817_2474986_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zipht">zipht</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323133/#Comment_323133" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-04T19:14:31+00:00" title="May  4, 2011  7:14PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So what games are people thinking of running?<br><br>I will probably run a session or two of Remember Tomorrow.. <br>It was great fun at Dreamation.<br><br>I like to switch up what games I run, so I gotta think about what other game I want to run..                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/forlorn1" title="forlorn1"><img alt="forlorn1" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/n6SIEC3F01EX7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/forlorn1">forlorn1</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323304/#Comment_323304" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-06T08:09:30+00:00" title="May  6, 2011  8:09AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Still deciding on what to run. <br><br> I know I'll be running some Fiasco and I have a Dread(Jenga) scenario that should be fun. <br><br>I'm also looking at running some PTA, since Smallville didn't seem to generate as much interest as I had hoped at Dreamation, and its requires alot of prep.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323342/#Comment_323342" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-06T14:37:51+00:00" title="May  6, 2011  2:37PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have mastered New Jersey Transit and the various NYC plagues I was infected with when I first came here, so I think I'll make it down.
