His name was James O'Rance and he produced some of the more interesting Australian freeforms over the past two decades while working on his own game system.<br/><br/>He wasn't overly active here, going by the name of <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/account.php?u=2052" rel="nofollow">simjames</a>. <br/><br/>I don't know how much his influence spread beyond these southern shores, I just thought I'd let the wider game community know that a shining light of Aussie game design has flickered out.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364992/#Comment_364992" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-04T00:49:02+00:00" title="March  4, 2012 12:49AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's too bad.

It is a loss of imaginative powers, a loss of initiative, a loss of heart. The loss of a dear soul is a reason to go into deep sorrow. I feel with you.<br/><br/>You are the one left. You and the other designers in the aussie culture of role-playing design. It is your culture now, your inheritance to carry into the future. Such is life, that the ones we look up to, the ones we trust in and expect to be there, as they have always been ...<br/>- they leave us one day. They die.<br/>and we are left to carry on. We are the ones left to develop the form further. We are the ones who must surpass the dead ones, for only by doing that can we show them that we really believed in their project; to make better games!<br/><br/>You are the one now, Michael, with your living peers, who are left to carry the culture forward. Take the burden of sorrow, Michael, and make the remembrance of James O'Rance a part of your hope for the future. <br/><br/>Take care!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365165/#Comment_365165" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-04T22:32:31+00:00" title="March  4, 2012 10:32PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I was a fan of some of his older work.

But I guess with the ephemeral nature of the medium, unless you participate in a designers work you can rarely be aware what a freeform artist has been developing...these things often have very sketchy write-ups, and often have key aspects locked in the designers mind (never committed to paper or file).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
