All they require is a US bank account to deposit the funds into. If you have a reliable person in the US who's willing to accept the money for you, or you have a US bank account yourself without being a US resident, then you can run a Kickstarter campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327369/#Comment_327369" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-01T14:31:38+00:00" title="June  1, 2011  2:31PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            IndieGoGo accepts credit card and paypal payments from anyone in the world. Anyone in the world can set it up. IndieGoGo let you keep the money if you fail, which is a disadvantage to some, but they charge extra if you do fail. <br/><br/>Kickstarter processes its orders via Amazon which not only requires a US bank account (which we have) but you effectively have to be a US citizen, too. I imagine that commercial pressure will soon force them to adapt - and it's the number one requested feature - but they were talking about doing it "soon" back in 2009. Kickstarter keeps 5% plus the 3-5% that Amazon charges. I'm pretty sure they don't accept paypal. This might be because of their model - no payment without the minimum.<br/><br/>We chose indiegogo for a modest project where we were reasonably confident we would hit the minimum. Most indie publishers appear to be using it to garner pre-orders, which are reasonably scaleable and don't require much of a fixed minimum. There is also the benefit of some patronage, too. It's a bit like the coffee shop model; you can pay what you want to pay for a coffee. <br/><br/>Our next major funding effort will also be indiegogo - this time, Robin Laws wants to do something other than work for hire, which we are very happy to support.

I've been involved in two crowdfunded projects, the Trail Character Generator and Stealing Cthulhu.<br/><br/>With both, the project would have gone ahead if the minimum hadn't been reached. So the Kickstarter method would have worked against us. If, for example, only 30 people had preordered Stealing Cthulhu, Kickstarter would have refunded all those preorders and I'd have had to get them again. That doesn't help the preorderers and it doesn't help me.<br/><br/>So, when the project will go ahead even without the minimum, I prefer the IndieGoGo model. When it won't, I prefer Kickstarter. (I admit to some doubt about whether any projects genuinely fall into the second category, but there you go.)<br/><br/>On a broader note, I really like IndieGoGo.

As a consumer, knowing that the minimum contribution to get the hardback for Do would decrease by almost half once a certain monetary goal was reached was the primary reason I contributed.

I've been wanting to share a talk I went to hosted by the University of Washington Press, which explained their "business model."  It was among the most depressing talks I've ever gone to.  Luke Crane has a more sustainable economic enterprise than the entire academic publishing world, no joke!<br/><br/>They said it took $30,000 and 3 years for them to produce a volume and, generally, they might end up selling 300-500 copies of a book.  Selling 1,000 copies was a significant success.  Also, they often didn't have the funds to afford a print run, so the press and authors would apply for grant funding to cover a significant amount of that.  Or, at some presses, the author might be asked to front some portion of printing costs themselves.<br/><br/>That entire industry is dead and it doesn't seem like they're doing much about it.  They still have a kind of vampire hold on the universities because many people still view publishing a volume through an academic press as they only way to gain scholarly status and tenure, but that's less and less true these days as both tenure and academic publishing continue to die. The whole system is going to crash and have to be rebuilt along totally different lines.  It's totally unsustainable and not really a "business" at all.<br/><br/>I had been considering approaching some academic presses to see if they'd be interested in publishing Magic Missile and/or another edited volume I might put together later on, but there's basically zero chance of that now, given how completely out-of-date their publishing model is.  I mean, I can sell 500-1000 copies of something through the normal indie games channels, given a year or two.  Waiting 3 years and having to raise $30,000 just isn't worth it for the kind of non-support that an academic press would apparently provide. I even know the kinds of people that I could contact to get peer review, which is the major service that academic presses provide. Essentially, I feel like I could run an entire academic press for RPG-related books much better than most actual academic presses.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
