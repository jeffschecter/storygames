I know the one about starting on a 9X9 board. I found a local friend of mine used to play Go (albeit roughly 12 years ago), and I am pretty sure I could coax some of you fine ladies and gentlemen to a game or two online...<br/><br/>Anyway, I've went through <a href="http://playgo.to/index-e.html" rel="nofollow">The Interactive Way to Go</a> today and it got me cracking.

We'd both learned from friends a number of years ago, but we had to look up the rules to make sure we weren't forgetting anything. This was when we both worked in a shop, so we built a nice 15x15 board and played during lunch. <br/><br/>Honestly, you just gotta play it a lot. I know that my brain goes into a certain mode when I'm playing Go that I usually don't experience - I'm not very good at specific stategizing, but the ability to process the next possible 2-3 moves for each player and decide which set of moves is likely to happen, and how to encourage or discourage that set of moves, is something that I think you just need to do a lot to get better at.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aumpa" title="Aumpa"><img alt="Aumpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i943.photobucket.com/albums/ad277/Suphyph/GreenFlammarion.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aumpa">Aumpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275042/#Comment_275042" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-08T16:29:29+00:00" title="June  8, 2010  4:29PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2010 1:12AM by Aumpa.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yay, Go!

I find learning Go an interesting issue of game pedagogy because the game is taught in weird ways and learned often with difficulty. This is, I think, an artifact of the game's uniqueness; nobody seems to have very good words and verbalized models that would explain to the prospective player what to look for when playing. Most Go players don't play other boardgames, so universal terminology doesn't have much traction. For this reason the only advice people seem to have about the game seems to be that you need to play the game enough to get it. This is true as far as it goes, but as a game designer I also like unnecessary verbalizations, so I want to have Go explained in words.<br/><br/>I wrote about this a couple of years back at my blog... <a href="http://isabout.wordpress.com/2008/03/18/learning-go/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, it's practically a short essay about how to learn to play Go. I'm not very good at the game (no practice), but I do think that I've figured out how it basically works. The key realization is that unlike Chess, Go is not a procedural game even while it's being played in turns. Rather, Go is about optimization: once you understand how the pieces played on the board project influence (it's emergent and not directly encoded in the rules, so it takes a bit of thinking and play to get that), you'll be able to evaluate the influence losses and gains caused by different moves. After that it's just a matter of counting the lost or gained influence of the possible follow-up moves to any given situation. Most crucially, while in Chess or similar you're usually trying to think of ways to counteract the opponent's last move, in Go your task is often to perceive whether it's better to counter the opponent's influence gain or develop your own influence on some other part of the board. Just remember that it's all about victory point gain, which you're trying to optimize while minimizing the victory point gains of your opponent. It's quite enchancing when you get to the level of being able to read the board and actually see the potential and already concluded areas of influence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aumpa" title="Aumpa"><img alt="Aumpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i943.photobucket.com/albums/ad277/Suphyph/GreenFlammarion.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aumpa">Aumpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275054/#Comment_275054" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-08T19:42:19+00:00" title="June  8, 2010  7:42PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2010 12:59AM by Aumpa.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Eero, it sounds like you had a very poor teacher. It's great that you were able to identify some elementary principles for beginners. Some of the good points that you identify in your essay are having <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?TwoEyes" rel="nofollow">two eyes for life</a>, build a <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?Framework" rel="nofollow">framework</a>, and develop <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?CornersThenSidesThenCenter" rel="nofollow">corner-sides-center</a>. These are things I explicitly tell the friends that I have taught-- when the time is right. Even those concepts can be premature if the student hasn't got the fundamentals of capturing stones.<br/><br/>Conveying go strategy in words actually has a long tradition. Certain things are said often enough that they have become proverbs, eg "<a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?path=GoProverbs&amp;page=TheEmptyTriangleIsBad" rel="nofollow">the empty triangle is bad</a>" and "<a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?path=GoProverbs&amp;page=PlayAwayFromThickness" rel="nofollow">play away from thickness</a>."

Which means it's hard to learn by playing with an experienced player--you tend to get trounced again and again and again. (Hence the advice to "lose your first 50 games", perhaps?)<br/><br/>I tried playing it with a friend of mine on a smaller board (I think we used a quarter of the regular board) AND a "handicap", where a certain number of my stones were placed on the board before we made our first moves. That helped a lot--unfortunately, we didn't get to follow up with that long enough for me to really learn how to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275131/#Comment_275131" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T08:47:39+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  8:47AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It sounds like we need to set up a Story-Games Go club <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>And Paul, 9x9 is a suggested beginners' size, and of course, there are handicap rules, but I have no idea how to make these work on a smaller board.<br/><br/>Well, I'll look into that Sensei link, keep reading what I already read, and look for a number of games to get things rolling, hmmm.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

You can play a bunch of 9x9 games on graph paper using pencils and erasers, which also serve as a record of past games. Give them a run down of the rules. If you've been playing igowin and reached the point of playing as white, then give the beginner-beginners 3-4 handicap stones on a 9x9.

A few I'd add:<br/><br/>KGS is the most friendly site I've found for real time online play. I actually play most of my online games on Dragon Go Server though, which is a turn based server:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.dragongoserver.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dragongoserver.net/</a><br/><br/>(turn based meaning that both players are not necessarily present at the same time, you just check in throughout the day and make moves when you have time)<br/><br/>My user name there is 'rafial' so if anybody in this thread wants to hit me up for a teaching game, or a regular game (if you are not a beginner) feel free to do so.<br/><br/>9x9 games are great to start with, but I really like playing 13x13 as well, as it gives you a taste for the strategic level of go (as opposed to 9x9 which is purely tactical) without the time commitment of playing a full 19x19 game.  When I was lucky enough to have a lunchtime partner at work, we played mostly 13x13, which typically lasted 30-45 minutes.<br/><br/>Once you understand the basics rules (e.g. you've read or used the interactive version of "The Way To Go" <a href="http://usgo.org/usa/waytogo/" rel="nofollow">http://usgo.org/usa/waytogo/</a> ), and played a few 9x9 games, start looking for collections of basic life &amp; death problems.  Sensei's library is a great place to start. <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?BeginnerExercises" rel="nofollow">http://senseis.xmp.net/?BeginnerExercises</a>  If you have an iPhone, SmartGo is a great learning app that has an extensive collection of interactive graded exercises.<br/><br/>If you play a stronger opponent face to face or online, and they trounce you, see if they are willing to spend some time reviewing the game. Getting commentary on a game you've actually played is hugely valuable.  The KGS client program is also a great tool for reviewing SGF (standard game format) records of online games you've played, or also professional games (you can find commented records of famous game online at many of the popular go sites).<br/><br/>Oh, and one sort of random tip, using Google to search for Go resources can be tricky, because 'Go' is such a generic word.  I've found that using the Korean name of the game (Baduk) can help filter search results.<br/><br/>There's never been a better time to learn Go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

The black stone in the corner of the example is really its own separate group, and therefore unprotected by any freedoms the rest of the black structure might have.<br/><br/>To get out of the guessing phase of learning, I suggest trying to understand the utility of playing a single stone near a corner position - once you understand how a living group is constructed and why it's easier in a corner, you'll have a strategic goal for your play, which makes the game so much more meaningful: you can just focus on putting up that living group (on the principle that at the end of the game you're only going to get points for living groups, so you might as well try to get at least one of those done early) and then extending its influence (that is, branching your invulnerable living group out as far as the opponent allows you to eat territory). Of course in a real game you won't finish the group, but rather only build it up so far as to make it impossible for the opponent to prevent you from finishing it should he try (which means he won't try, which means you never have to do it), but that will only happen once you understand how to create the group in the first place. Getting this intentionality into your play instead of just putting down stones at random seems to me like a necessary step in making the game of Go actually interesting; once you know how to create that living corner group the rest of the game slots into place as you start to understand the development moves on the sides of the board as encroachment from a strong corner, start to understand the more central moves as opponent pressure on the living corner that prevents it from expanding, start to understand why the game begins at corners, sometimes jumps to other corners and only gets to the center towards the end... it's all there once you get down the idea that only living groups will give you points at the end, and livings groups are easiest to construct against the board edges, but you don't actually finish the construction during a normal game because the opponent can read the board as well and he won't waste his moves on lost causes.<br/><br/>If the above seems like an useful mental model, consider this: the reason for why there are empty areas within living groups larger than one cell is that the opposing player is able to read the board and recognize that the group lives - that is, should he start playing inside the group, the group's owner would be able to counter his moves and capture any stones he plays inside the form. This is always true when you play inside a living structure, unless there is so much space inside there that you can actually construct your own living group inside the opponent's, thus denying him territory. In fact, the difference between "inside" and "outside" of a group is solely this: outside is still such a large space that you can live there, while inside is just the right size in terms of opponent influence that he can kill anything you play in there. The scoring system of the game discourages playing dead stones - it's always better for you if you can know in advance whether a given stone will ultimately die by the opponent's constraint. In fact, it seems to me that Go is largely about this simple precept: the player whose understanding of the current board's life and death is better will win, because he won't waste moves on playing dead stones as much as the opponent. Players will only fight for area or fight to defend a group when they disagree about which groups are living and which are dead; this disagreement is ultimately resolved by finishing the structure and thus proving to the other player that the group you were looking at actually was living or was dead, and now the board proves it. Make mistakes in this evaluation and you will waste your moves defending what is not defensible, or attacking what is not conquerable. It's all an optimization game, and to optimize you need to be able to tell when some stones are a dead cause and when they can still be saved by quick play.<br/><br/>In practice I find that all of the above stuff about live vs. dead groups and corner play vs. center play only makes practical sense once you have the tactics of the game down. In other words, how do you "attack" or "defend" in this game? The superficial answer is that you attack by closing off freedoms of the opponent's stone (or stone group, as a group lives or dies as one) and defend by expanding the group, thus giving it more freedoms. The tricky part here is that when you place a stone to eat a freedom from a group, that stone you just played also loses a freedom (or several, even). In fact, the big tactical idea you need to play sensibly is that if the opponent just played his first stone on the board and you follow up by playing one yourself right next to it to "attack", you're actually at a serious disadvantage; while both of those stone have lost one freedom (and thus have only three left), <i>it's the opponent's turn next</i>, and thus he gets to play another stone to defend his own stone or (even better) attack yours. This phenomenon means that defense is naturally stronger in Go than offense, and therefore you cannot attack intelligibly without preparations. Specifically, what you need to play first is a supporting stone that is a bit farther away from your victim. Once you have this free, strong stone in place, you can place your attack stone: assuming the opponent has just the one stone, he's at a disadvantage once you connect your attack stone to your existing infrastructure (even if it's just the one support stone), thus making it part of a stronger group which the opponent can't kill off before you kill off his stone. This tactical interplay is the basic unit of logic in Go that explains why stones "project force": a stone played next to another stone is stronger than alone, but a stone played only one step away from a friendly stone is also stronger than a truly isolated stone, as you can connect it with just one move. This logic extends farther away, too, with the question always being: is your stone so far out from your base of power that the opponent can slip in a structure of his own, cutting your impertinent stone off from the reinforcements? Once you understand this tactical issue, you will also understand how and why the stone "frameworks" are played the way they are: instead of putting stones tidily next to each other and building walls of them to limit areas and build living groups, players race forward, leaving gaps in their structures, trusting in the projected support of the other stones they place to dissuade the opponent from playing into those gaps. Thus the right way of building a group is not to assiduously play stones into a group, but rather to scatter them out in a flexible "framework" that you will be able to fill in into solid lines if and when the opponent judges that you've overstepped and extended yourself too far with too little material. To play otherwise is to lose the game due to slowness: while you fill in your lines against non-present threats the opponent develops other corners and center positions of the board, giving himself what equals to handicap stones in other parts of the board. You will win that one corner you're developing, but he will take the rest of the board. In this way the small tactical issue of attack vs. defense becomes the emergent phenomenon of stone frameworks, which in turn leads to the game's core issue of score optimization: if your opponent is fiddling with something useless, such as attacking a living group or defending a living group, feel free to play development moves elsewhere, extending your frameworks; never waste time on reinforcing frameworks that are not right now under pressure from the enemy. Only build solid lines and prove that your stones can live when the opponent obliges you to do it by attacking. Most of the game happens in the mind, as both you and the opponent have an internal, shifting picture of which stones are alive and which are dead. When these images are in contradiction, play happens, and the one who pictured the situation more correctly will win, assuming equal tactics.<br/><br/>That's my bite-size Go lecture.

Instead always move elsewhere and build your position. Now of course that's not a winning strategy, since sometimes you really do need to react, but it's a good way to explore what the rest of the strategy space looks like. You'll see how much the opponent thinks it needs to do to "finish off" a group, and see how much you can gain while an opponent is busy attacking you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I found it rather aggravating to play Go against a stronger player when playing my first game, as I was basically wasting his time by thinking, and not even doing that very well. Then he insisted on showing me my mistakes after the game, which was even more annoying, as I wasn't even playing with any kind of plan and didn't know what I was doing anyway, so I didn't exactly have any basis for appreciating any mistakes; I didn't have context for the explanation, to put it simply. I can't say that I'd have learned anything much from that, as the tactical details are difficult and boring to study when you haven't yet grasped the strategic level.<br/><br/>Play against another beginner, though, and you have a chance to start by playing badly and work your way up from there. It's like... you're both basically trying to get those safe protective fences up, and trying to create eyes or prevent each other from creating them, just like a good player would; it's just that when you're both bad players, you both read the game just as primitively, and therefore neither of you is just going to shrug his shoulders about the currently active arrangement and go play something weird in the opposite corner, because neither of you is able to see 20 moves in advance whether that three-stone group has life or death. Being a bad player forces you to play the situation into 5-move range of the inevitable end before you can read it, at which point you can even point it out to your opponent and move to develop the rest of the board. This way the game preserves intentionality: each of your moves actually has a purpose. I find this to be true of any game: to actually be able to learn from your opponent, you have to be able to understand why he makes the moves he does. Go is unique in this because of its alinearity: the game is designed such that the best play often develops many simultaneous and unrelated situations, which means that you can't actually understand the advanced player's moves when he makes them, only when the game has ended. It takes a stronger man than I to remember and care about some mistake I made on move 6 after the game, frankly, so it's better if you can follow what your opponent is thinking constantly as you play.<br/><br/>Hmm... I'm almost tempted to think that some sort of Go-learning method is buried under here somewhere. Perhaps Go should be learned by playing in just one corner? You could say that the inner player (the one who builds position in the corner) wins if his group lives, while the outer player wins if he manages to kill the inner group. Of course this game is always a win or loss for the inner player depending on how far out he begins his construction, but actually being able to prove that by play seems like a basic requirement of being able to play intentional Go.<br/><br/>Also, <i>sente</i> and <i>gote</i>: I notice a good insight in that essay I wrote a couple of years back, namely that a primitive player can get insight into the thought processed of his opponent by evaluating his reaction to your own moves: if his next move doesn't seem to have anything to do with what you just did, that means that you just lost initiative; the opponent didn't find what you just did to be consequential enough to require a reply, which should be a hint for you as well to turn your attention away from that situation: either you're already dead or already alive, and it's probably better to let the opponent demonstrate which it is when the frames are filled in in the late game. Of course this is going to fuck you up if you follow the opponent's lead blindly, but it's probably going to be more educational to assume that his play is honest than to assume that he's trying to actively mislead you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275259/#Comment_275259" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T19:45:49+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  7:45PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also: this has been a good discussion, I'm inspired to crack out the Go board and teach the game to my nephews.

Just like it in the Chess world, serious players get a rating by playing against other rated players.  The Go rating system starts with "kyu" rankings, which start around 20 to 30 for a new player, and count down to 1 kyu, after which comes 1 dan (the mastery or black belt level if you will), and then counts up to a traditional maximum of 9 dan.<br/><br/>20k -&gt; 19k -&gt; 18k ... 3k -&gt; 2k -&gt; 1k -&gt; 1d -&gt; 2d ... 9d<br/><br/>Your Go ranking is also useful because it tells you what handicap you should use when playing another rated player.  So if you are 8 kyu, and want a good game against 5 kyu, then you (the 8 kyu) will take the black stones, and put down three stones before the stronger player makes their first move.  A 2 kyu player playing a 3 dan player would receive 4 stones for the difference in rank (i.e. 2k -&gt; 1k -&gt; 1d -&gt; 2d -&gt; 3d).<br/><br/>Go playing computer programs have of course had their strength estimated by playing against humans, so for example I believe GnuGo is considered to be somewhere in the range of 10-12k playing on its highest setting, and MfoG is a couple stones stronger. (Since the difference between ranks is the number of stones you get as a handicap, strength differentials will often be talked about in terms of "stones")<br/><br/>Since 1 dan is very accomplished, yet not uncommon level of expertise, and such a player could easily crush Gnu Go or MfoG even giving it a fairly large handicap, you get the "Go is too hard for computers!" story that was mentioned above, which some Go players like to wax on and on about. They game definitely is very computationally intensive, but it could be argued that it hasn't received the level intensive effort that chess has attracted.  Recently programs have emerged that can be competitive against dan level players on the 9x9 board, although not yet larger (at least that I've heard).<br/><br/>So to sum up, playing at their strongest settings, and with no handicap, it is expected that MfoG would trounce GnuGo.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aumpa" title="Aumpa"><img alt="Aumpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i943.photobucket.com/albums/ad277/Suphyph/GreenFlammarion.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aumpa">Aumpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275454/#Comment_275454" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-11T00:19:35+00:00" title="June 11, 2010 12:19AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: PeterBB</cite>Is there such a thing as commentary on go games, like there is for chess?

The game is a lot about the life and death (LD) of groups. Here are some other points, summed in proverbs, that I think you got correct:<br/><br/><a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?path=GoProverbs&amp;page=StrengtheningYourOwnWeakGroupMakesYourOpponentsWeaker" rel="nofollow">Strengthening your own groups makes your opponent's weaker.</a><br/><a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?path=GoProverbs&amp;page=DontAttachWhenAttacking" rel="nofollow">Don't attach while attacking.</a><br/><a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?path=GoProverbs&amp;page=TheStrongPlayerPlaysStraightTheWeakPlaysDiagonal" rel="nofollow">The strong player plays straight, the weak plays diagonal.</a><br/><a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?path=GoProverbs&amp;page=MakeAFistBeforeStriking" rel="nofollow">Make a fist before striking.</a><br/><br/>However, you might have put too much emphasis on LD, and underestimated the importance of <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?AboutInfluence" rel="nofollow">influence.</a> Most plays on the board are not directly concerned with the LD status of groups. Here's a proverb that may be contrary to what you have said, which could be valuable for improving your own game:<br/><br/><a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?path=GoProverbs&amp;page=DontUseThicknessToMakeTerritory" rel="nofollow">Don't use thickness to make territory.</a><br/>and the related<br/><a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?path=GoProverbs&amp;page=PlayAwayFromThickness" rel="nofollow">Play away from thickness.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Help Me Learn Go! - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12268/help-me-learn-go/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Help Me Learn Go! - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12268/help-me-learn-go/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="That's good stuff, Russell.

Thanks. Influence is important, but I'm leaving it out and approaching it from the viewpoint of life and death because that seems to me like a more straightforward way of understanding the game. Once you understand your mission as regards living groups that win points, you can understand influence as a potential, uncompleted board position: stones extend influence over the board because both players can read forward and thus realize that aha, this stone here will come into play in this arrangement 50 moves from now if I continue playing like this. This fundamental vector of influence cannot be understood before you have a handle on the local mission of making sure that the enemy doesn't kill this stone of mine.<br/><br/>I don't want to debate proper Go strategy with actual hobbyists, though - I'm purely an occasional amateur here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275573/#Comment_275573" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-11T11:07:15+00:00" title="June 11, 2010 11:07AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, once you're somewhat experienced, when actually playing Go your main concern is influence. I think the trouble with teaching/learning Go is that you <i>cannot</i> gauge influence by intuition until you have kinda correct intuitions about which groups are alive and dead, what kind of formations will have an easy time living or a difficult or impossible time living after further play, etc. The experienced has this intuition and so can say "play away from thickness!" and intuit that the reason is thickness implies a formation which will have an easy time living, which provides your play a direction to grow which if blocked by the opponent, will pincer the opponent instead of dying. The unexperienced does not have this intuition and so must at best intellectually understand the above.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this means that the first steps to learning Go have little in common with the eventual things you actively think about when playing Go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aumpa" title="Aumpa"><img alt="Aumpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i943.photobucket.com/albums/ad277/Suphyph/GreenFlammarion.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aumpa">Aumpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275757/#Comment_275757" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-12T18:24:35+00:00" title="June 12, 2010  6:24PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just finished my first tournament.
