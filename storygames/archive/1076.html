                    Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I'm new to the site. I had contributed to and play-tested for other systems in the past.  I had several ideas for games and began to work on them. So, over the past several years I've been developing a multi-universal points-allocation RPG as well as a few other projects on the back burner. The main project has had some interesting hang-ups in the play-testing department.  Being multi-universal I have had to test the system in different genre.  But, playtesters are reluctant at best to try out a "homebrew" system.  By the way, may I say I hate that term: "homebrew".  I have had groups of playtesters vanish because of a new MMORPG that spread like a virus.  An emotional entanglement that undermined another group. I've went to local cons to run one-shot adventures and had no one sign up to play.  But the last group I will detail, really left me wondering about the nature of playtesting.  <br/>
<br/>
The final playtest group was involved in a super-powered campaign set in my system.  I had managed to get five players together for the playtest, most of them with decades of experience.  One player, Player A, had a character that acted violently beyond all reason.  So much so that in-character official censure came down on his character.  Player B wanted to set up a secret organization of "heroes" by recruiting villains from jail.  He directed his efforts to establish an alter-ego with a front man, and when all his plans were coming to fruition, he accused me of forcing his hand and making him set up the organization.  Player C dropped because when he deduced what a clue left by a villain meant, Player B said, "that's what I have dice for".  Player D dropped shortly there after because role-playing was becoming impossible in the group.  Player E tried to stick it out and compromise with Player A and Player B.  Player A and Player B decided the game system was broken.  I asked for feedback as to what the issues were so I could fix them.<br/>
<br/>
Amazingly, there were no issues with the system, but rather with my GMing-style.  They didn't like having consequences to character actions.  Player D actually agreed to participate in a group discussion online, though Player C wanted nothing to do with the others at that point.  Player D agreed that the system wasn't the issue, and said that the only fault I had was not screening my playtesters thouroughly. Players A and B continued on and each and every "system" issue revolved around PC interactions (with both NPCs and PCs), storyline plots, and consequences for overt actions. Player E kept quite as she didn't want to alienate any of her friends, but confidentially gave feedback that the system was "okay".  Playtesters seem to fall over themselves to test established systems.  Is it the lure of swag?  Is it the feeling of legitimacy?  Is it a bid at a "high paying job" with Palladium?  I've tried having other GMs run scenarios in the system, and they can never get enough players to commit to the test.  I have seen the topic about online playtesting discussed here, but that seems to have died out over a month ago.  <br/>
<br/>
In these MMORPG days, can system mechanics be tested in a game setting with actual role-play or should I just run gladiatorial exchanges to test viability of the system?  If actual RPG is an option, what should I do to encourage playtesters to give valid system feedback and keep that seperate from group dynamics in and out of character?  I am particpating in a few gamer meet-ups in the area to try and find new play-testers.  So any advice at this point would be greatly appreciated.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks.                </div>

                            What was your screening process like for players? You cite that your players had "decades of experience;" maybe that experience comes with baggage that will make it easier to find playtesters among newer players?                        </div>

                            You might also farm out your playtesting to other GMs and other groups. After all, if you really want your game to be played, at some point it's going to be played by someone other than you.<br/>
<br/>
Playtesting is the awesomest part of building a game, don't listen to Tony. It's like publishing only it doesn't cost anything and you know exactly who is using the game.                        </div>

                            Another use of playtesting by groups outside your circle is that they can also test the clarity of your writing in addition to the intuitiveness and balance of your system.<br/><br/>I've built up a group to be my playtesters. It hasn't really stuck. I keep ramping myself up to make them start a playtest, then someone will make an off-hand remark that strikes a nerve and I put the pages back in my bag and grab some WoD shit off the shelf.                        </div>

                            One thing stands out from your post that made me sit up and go "Wha?!" - "They didn't like having consequences to character actions." So what did they want out of the game? To run around and kill stuff and try to break your world without you hitting back at some point?<br/><br/>Anyway, that's besides the point. I'm always in two minds about playtesting too. I have a close group of friends who I can rely on for honest feedback, and who are good at dismantling my lovely ideas and dreams. I rely on them for playtesting initially, even if it's just for a session or whatever. Have you got a couple of good gaming buddies you can rely on? Doesn't have to be a full size group or anything more than a few sessions, but sit down with them and hammer through the game and put the rules to the test. Those initial few sessions will see whether the game has legs, at which point you can throw it wide to other groups.                        </div>

                            You cannot properly finish writing your game without playtesting first. You cannot properly playtest a game -- or just plain play -- without a having socially functional gaming group first.<br/>
<br/>
As Andrew said, you need "good gaming buddies you can rely on" to do the initial playtesting, so that when they tell you to your face, "uh, this sucks," you know they mean the game, not you as a human being, and that they will explain the specific details of what doesn't work so you can fix them.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you're having some struggles getting any kind of group together. "An emotional entanglement [had] undermined another group," you said -- you don't have to answer, but I presume that's shorthand for the standard "somebody is/was/wants to be dating the GM, and the resulting jealousy/break-up/infatuation, instead of being openly and honestly discussed among adults, was denied in public but constantly channelled into in-character bickering/fighting/favoritism." That's a classic sign of a group of people that should NOT be gaming with each other (or sleeping with each other until they grow up a little bit, for that matter). So does the array of strongly held, incompatible preferences among your playtest group: In Ron Edwards terminology, that group moved beyond "Creative Agenda incoherence" to "social disfunction."<br/>
<br/>
Have you read the "Fun Now Manifesto":<br/>
<br/>
1. Not everyone likes the same thing<br/>
2. Play with people you like<br/>
3. Play with rules you like<br/>
4. Everyone is a player<br/>
5. Talking is good<br/>
6. Trust, not fear or power<br/>
7. It's a game, not a marriage<br/>
8. Fun stuff at least every 10 minutes<br/>
9. Fix problems, don't endure them<br/>

                            Thanks for the comments everyone.  Now to answer your questions.<br/>
<br/>
 To:  misuba<br/>
  My screening process was initially an open call to the local gaming community.  We have several local forums and mailing lists that I solicited players from for the play test.  After I got people on board then I asked them about their experience.  There was one "newbie" among them and sadly he was kill crazy from the start.  <br/>
<br/>
To:  TonyLB<br/>
<br/>
The majority of my play-testing has been face to face.  <br/>
<br/>
To:  JDCorley and Russel Collins<br/>
<br/>
I have tried to "farm out" some of the GMing, but all that has fallen through.  I really want feedback from other GMs.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To:  andrew_kenrick<br/>
you said: " So what did they want out of the game? To run around and kill stuff and try to break your world without you hitting back at some point?"<br/>
<br/>
I really can't say that it was a "hit back".  An in charcter lecture about excessive force, an official reprimand, and probationary measures should have been the equivalent of a slap on the wrist for a modern day campaign for unwarranted violence.  I didn't have lynch mobs coming after the PC or anything.  I was trying to hold the group together to get data.  I wouldn't have minded if they were just trying to push the limits of the game mechanic, but the idea for at least two of the players was very destrucive.<br/>
<br/>
To:  Sydney Freedberg<br/>
 The emotional entaglement involved one of the players and a person outside the group who was a friend of my wife.  My wife's friend was also married, and the whole situation placed the group in the middle of marital strife that shouldn't even have involved the group, ever.  <br/>
<br/>
As for the Fun Now Manifesto, I agree with almost everything there.  There are a few things that apply to standard games, that don't completely apply to a play-test in my opinion.  "Play with people you like".  You don't necessarily need to like your play-testers, as long as they can provide feedback.  A co-worker, teacher, or boss may not be on your top 100 people list, but they can provide information to improve your work.  "Fun stuff at least every 10 minutes".  This goes back to not everyone likes the same thing.  Fun is like candy, the majority of people like it.  Some are allergic to chocolate.  Some like licorice.  Some like face-imploding sour. Some live for it.  Some need it in small doses.  If you do know a universal key to fun, I do hope you'll share.  <br/>

                            I started to make a joking comment about "I might not like them, but I like their money", but I realized you all don't know me well enough to intuitively know it was a joke.  The state of the RPG industry at the present should show everyone this isn't a quick road to wealth.  Part of what elated me when I discovered this place was that it is "Story Games For Everyone".  I have a few products in development that are for specific demographic groups.  The Precursor RPG is certainly the broadest appeal of the games.  It is designed to support various genre and there is a detailed section about GMs consciously integrating their worldview into campaign settings.  In light of this aspect, in the introduction of the core book it talks about diversity in role-playing and finding a group that suits your personal taste and style.  <br/>
<br/>
But again, this is in context of playtesting a product.  If someone, who I dislike on a personal level, has a genuine interest in my game should I turn them away?  Or should I be open to hear their feedback and evaluate it for what it represents?  And to clarify, I'm not saying that I'd knowingly game with a racist or hatemonger, not that they would want to game with me.  From an ethical standpoint, I can't immediately disregard a person's input based on my personal feelings toward them.    <br/>
<br/>
So, I agree with the ideas in the Manifesto regarding personal gaming, but I will make exceptions for playtesting.  I do want a product that appeals to more than just me on a personal basis.  I appreciate your view.  I realize this system can't please every role-player out there, but I can attempt not to needlessly alienate a portion of them.                        </div>

                            Gryph, it sounds like you are trying to design a game that appeals to as many people as possible.  That's a sure-fire way to make a game that appeals to no one at all.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%238&amp;Mode=like">#8</a> on the Manifesto only works when <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> is firmly applied.  You patently cannot have "Fun Stuff Every 10 Minutes" if the "Fun Stuff" is different for everybody at the table.  You're trying to playtest your game using standards that are simply impossible to meet.  You can't make a game that will be consistently engaging for a group of people who have completely different interests.  You are chasing phantoms up the wrong tree.                        </div>

                            The good thing about only playing with my long-time friends is that I can trust them and know what to expect. The bad thing is that when it comes to playtesting I could stand to get opinions from more than just the same guys I've known for over a decade.<br/><br/>If I ever get around to running Thrash at a con, my Secret Plan is to bill it as a Street Fighter game that happens to use my game's rules. I don't know good of an idea that is, but the Firefly game I played in at GenCon SoCal '04 attracted plenty of players without anyone particularly caring one way or the other that it used GURPS.<br/><br/>Oh, and personally, I've completely given up on the idea of designing a universal RPG. Mostly I'm doing stuff that covers a specific genre as well I can manage.                        </div>

  Well, you just have to keep at it. I think we all do have horror stories of bad groups, playtest or otherwise. I do think its important to build up a good group you can game iwth, then introduce your game. Sort of eliminate as many variables as possible.<br/>
  I do think its important that your playtest group like each other (including you), good gaming relies on a good group. Get a group together that like similar games and each other.<br/>

                            I agree that you don't need your game to be playtested by people you like. Ideally it should be playtested by total strangers who have no contact with you other than through the text that you send them to playtest. And the way you get people willing to do that is to pay them. If they're local, you don't have to pay them much. Take them out to dinner after they're done playing and responding (prepare playtest response forms that focus in on what you are interested in)  and keep your mouth shut when they talk about your game, make no comments, give no explanations, just listen, listen, listen.                        </div>

                            To JDCorley:  I agree completely.  I guess I'm going to have to reconscile myself with spending some money on play-testing the same way I pay artists.  The taking a group out to dinner is probably a good idea.  Thanks for the suggestion.<br/>
<br/>
To Misuba:  I've been involved in a few play-tests for other companies and I've found that actual play-test feedback is 5 times better than people giving feedback based on a "cold" reading of the material.  I mean no offense by that and I'm not questioning anyone's ability to observe opportunities and improve upon ideas, but it has been my experience that the best developmental tool is play-testing.  Now, if any of you have a group that's sitting around doing nothing, are just dying to playtest something, and you don't have one of your own projects in need of their tender loving care, then let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all.                        </div>

Yes, absolutely, this kind of "blind" playtest is ideal.<br/><br/>BUT:<br/><br/>The issue isn't "playtest with people that personally like the designer." It's "playtest with people that like EACH OTHER." If a group can't get along when they're playing their favorite game, they're not going to give you a useful playtest of your game.<br/><br/>You'll get something like, "Well, we all made each other miserable, the way we normally do, plus we didn't understand all of the rules, so your game sucks." It's as useful as sending deaf people a demo tape of your band's new album: "Well, when we turned up the volume all the way like we normally do, we could feel a pleasant thumping through the floor -- is that what you wrote your song to do?"                        </div>

                            Posted By: misubaGryph - sorry, I should have been more clear: I actually think we'll be able to give you better feedbackon how to playtestif we at least get the view from a hundred feet up about how your game is intended to run. Can you summarize in a couple of paragraphs?<br/>
<br/>
From about 100 feet up:<br/>
<br/>
It is a multi-unviersal (varied genre), points allocation system.  Unlike most allocation systems there is not an increase in points in character creation for character "flaws" or "disadvantages".  There are character traits that can be purchased that give a benefit in one area and often represent an opportunity or other difficulty for the character in another regard.  The cost of the trait is balanced when comparing the benefit and the degree of detriment to a character.     <br/>
<br/>
Precursor uses a d10 mechanic to resolve contests.  Three is the maximum amount of d10s anyone needs for the game and that is to resolve combat situations or competitive high stress situations.  <br/>
<br/>
Where I feel the main opportunities lie are:  in the construction of "unique" items; and the appeal of the magic system (why it is beneficial to buy spell skills versus buying "supernatural powers" out right).  Unique items creation is an involved process that factors in character skills, character resources, and so forth.  It gives the character a chance to benefit from what should actually come into play in creation of this type of device, but will seem more complex than it actually is.  In the magic system, spells can have benefits beyond buying a supernatural power directly, but they are not inherently cheaper, for game balance purposes.  <br/>
<br/>
One of the strengths of the system is that it allows a degree of flexibility in playing to characters' strengths in determining skill levels.  The player makes those decisions at creation as characterisitcs form the building blocks of skills.  <br/>
<br/>
That's how it looks from way up there.                        </div>

                            a) This depends on the setting and genre the GM is using.  I have 5 settings in each of 6 genre as possibilities and an entire section for the GM on world crafting and the questions they should answer before beginning a campaign.  What the game is about is very dependent on what the GM wants the game to be about is the best answer I can give you.  Does the GM want to run a character driven drama around an assassination plot to kill the Emperor?  Is he running a silver-age comic hero story?  I have less influence over what people play with this system, and more of how it unfolds.<br/>
<br/>
b) This depends on the players interpretation of the expectations of the GMs selected world.  Ideally they would role-play their characters as appropriate to the setting they all agreed upon.  In lieu of that they do what their compulsion leads them to while rolling dice to accomplish their player goals.<br/>
<br/>
c)  Presumably, they will respond to situations based on what the NPCs and PCs say and do. <br/>
<br/>
I am not going to dictate which style of campaign or story a group chooses to run.  Hack and slash or soap opera is beyond the pervue of the designer if it is truly a multi-universal game.  I could tell you the games settings I run and what happens, but it seems irrelevent as  I'm not making this game just for me.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The system is a system of metrics and resolution.  There are settings included.  But they run from sci-fi societies where artificial intelligences covertly isolated humanity into agorphobic lifestyles and only the truly brave venture from their homes to seek out genuine relationships, a "traditional" fantasy adventure setting, or a super-heroic comedy to name a few.  The goal of the game is dependent on what the group of players actually works out together.  They could play a bunch of office workers and bureaucrats trying to get the least work done possible while avoiding the official eye of reprimand, if that is what they wish and that makes them happy.<br/>
<br/>
The scope of the game is limited only by the imaginations and tastes of the players and the limitations of the mechanic the game provides.  <br/>
<br/>
I know those aren't clean cut simple.  a) grab the loot, b) solve riddles that lead to more experience to mold her/his character, c) follow the plot to the next pay-off but truly the game is but one option.  GURPS, Hero System, Rifts, d20, and a lot of other systems are dependent on the players and the setting as to how the game should unfold.  The setting specific goals are transient, the mechanic is what I want tested, so any outright flaws can be fixed.  If it breaks down in a super heroic setting, it might not be noticed in a heavy role-play character interaction game, but it will stand out like a neon sign in a brawls to the wall every week super gladiator game.  There may be a bias toward role-play, but that is the extent of it.                        </div>

                            Gryph: as you are now seeing, we're gonna do our best to make you go all hippie :-)<br/><br/>But! To keep the scope of the discussion to playtesting: I think two parts of the problem may be that 1) a point-allocation system doesn't bring out the best in a lot of gamers, as they have grown accustomed over the years to getting screwed if they don't twink themselves out, and 2) a point-allocation system gives you an awful lot of variables to control for. On the latter point, you might be well served by making some pre-gen characters to test a few specific system elements at a time. On the former, you might be well served by building a world that you know anti-social twinks will be revolted by... which limits your pool of potential players on the surface, but may actually deepen it in the long (or medium, anyway) run.<br/><br/>As for your answers to the Big 3 Questions: you've kind of begged them. I mean, they're also not great questions in my opinion. But if what your system gets a vote on is how play unfolds, not what people play, then what's <i>that</i> about in your game? And what will players do to interact with that, as opposed to what they do in other similar systems?<br/><br/>Finally, I'll pose what I think is a better diagnostic question: what is it about your game that's gonna be <i>so awesome</i> that you can't wait to get done with the design so that you can play it?                        </div>

<br/>
gryphons_quill responds:  Iâ€™ve got settings that only character-interaction-oriented players could truly appreciate.  The pool for them among playtesters has been virtually non-existent.  The system isnâ€™t very friendly to â€˜twinkiesâ€™, as it were.  You can pick a direction for a character and go hard-line that way, but youâ€™ll leave the character rather underdeveloped in other aspects.  Depending on the setting, such as settings with paranormal aspects, this could prove dangerous for the combat-monster-power-gamer-twinkie-munchkin-character.  <br/>

<br/>
gryphons_quill responds:  The con-based games I had setup were focused on specific genre and had pre-gen characters.  Unfortunately, no takers.  I think when I do this next, Iâ€™ll fuse it with the pay the play-testers idea and have a monetary prize drawing based on filling out feedback forms.  <br/>

<br/>
gryphons_quill responds:  In this system, there are no â€œcriticalâ€ successes or failures.  The engine supports automatic successes or failures based on what is being attempted.  In example:  A skilled accountant trying to find a discrepancy in an average personâ€™s checking account wouldnâ€™t have to even roll the dice.  An accountant trying to locate embezzlement at a corporate level would need to roll in the contest of skills.  There is a slight bias towards PC success built into the mechanic.     <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
gryphons_quill responds:  From a nuts and bolts perspective, I like the emotional as well as situational modifiers for skills and such, the automatic successes or failures that can be role-played out with out the static time of dice calculation, and for when/if there is need for such the quick combat system that accounts for many character metrics.    But, mainly I like my settings for the various genre and want to see where participants take them.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, I find feedback about how to attract/employ playtesters has been very useful.  Analyzing the system outside the context of actual play is something I personally see as a marginal benefit activity.                        </div>

Hint:"Whatever you want to" is not an answer thatyou yourselfare happy with, given that your playtest in the OP was certainly expressive of whatever your playtesters wanted to spend their gametime doing.<br/>
<br/>
No, I'm concerned with mechanics properly supporting character actions.<br/>
<br/>
______________________________________________________________________________________________________<br/>
<br/>
Hint: Whatever you want to as long as you are prepared to accept a reasonable response or consequence from your character's action. <br/>
______________________________________________________________________________________________________<br/>
<br/>
I've been vague about certain things on purpose, and of course people draw conclusions.  It's understandable.  I was vague about an "emotional entanglement" and the assumption was it was involving me directly.  Not everything is clear cut and I don't feel it is appropriate for me to type away countless iterations of anecdotal play in the system to show why certain players were displeased with the things that happened in game.<br/>
<br/>
I'll detail a specific event I've alluded to and you can judge then if I indeed lacked the neccessary clues for character behavior in the setting. <br/>
<br/>
An anecdote of Player A's violence:<br/>
<br/>
First, the setting was a world where super-powers exist.  The rise of the super powered being began in the 19th Century with folk heroes such as John Henry, Pecos Bill, Paul Bunyan being examples of a return to the mythic age that gave us legends of gods.  Super beings have a wide range of power levels from just looking odd to earth-shattering manifestations. The lower powered beings are very common.  (I'll spare you the slang for the setting, it's a "you have to be there thing". There's more to this setting than men in capes, but that's far too much to go into beyond the summary provided.) Now contextually the game is modern day.  In this setting a powerful and influencial man setup a corporate superhero group for his own agenda.  The PCs were members of this group.  Personal motivations for the characters ran from tryng to correct past mistakes to wanting a regular paycheck.  Player A wanted to play a ninja in this game.  We talked before hand about "ninja" versus "super hero ninja" and all seemed well.<br/>

                            One adventure, after several violent outbursts by the character of Player A's character, Player B' character was on a regular patrol of the fictional city and noticed something suspicious (a tip of the iceberg adventure hook) at a biomedical facility one evening and called for back-up from the rest of the team and notified the P.S.I.(Paranormal Situations and Investigations) unit of the local authorities.  The other team members arrive shortly, and discover group of people replacing biological materials at a fertility clinic with alternate biological materials (nice and vague).  These intruders had overcome the guards using tasers and were dressed in ski masks and such.  Upon seeing "super heroes" these people begin to scatter through the building.  Player A's ninja pursues.  The ninja ends up on top of an elevator car with a fleeing "suspect" in it.  Other team members used powers to get to the ground floor before the elevator to stop the "bio-terrorist's" escape.  The elevator door opens and the fleeing individual sees supers waiting for him.  He begins reaching for the button to close the doors.  At this point is when Player A decides that he will spring through the panel in the roof of the elevator car and chop of the hand reaching for the button.  Easily done since the person in the elevator was equivalent to a "normal" person.  Now you and I know that someone could have put their hand in the elevator door and stopped it from closing.  Also with him on top, he could have entered and subdued the person at anytime before the elevator reached the ground floor.  But, he wanted to do it this way.  And I let him.  The disconnect comes here, when the P.S.I. unit arrives they are looking at a guy in shock from blood loss and the ninja proudly standing over his collapsed form.  The other supers have captured thugs as well, but didn't maim the suspects.  It's a modern day setting, I'm not sure why there was such a disconnect, but when terms like excessive force entered into the conversation, it blew his mind.  When the boss at corporate head-quarters is lecturing him over liability and his history of violence and pending civil action from the suspect, he decides that this is unfair.  Player B decides to form his own team covertly, because he decides Player A's predicament is an indication that their company is a corrupt organization.  I work with Player B and Player A to set these palns in motion, once again allowing them to do what they wanted to do in response to the setting.  Other adventures occur while this is underway and Player A switches characters.  The decision was based on putting everything into powers for the character with no traits or background elements.  This character was homeless and had amnesia.  The player expected him to be allowed onto the corporate team.  He wasn't hired.  Player B pushes his plans ahead for his team more quickly to include Player A's new character.  When it is time to unveil this plan and begin their new team, Player B becomes paranoid that he was setup for some reason.  I am accused of forcing him to form this team, some of whom were known psychopathic criminals he "recruited" as heroes from prisons.  A and B had already run off two role-oriented players from the play-test.  By accounts given to me later by Player D their disruptive influence was the problem not the setting or my game mastering.  They got to do what they wanted, but were displeased that there were consequences.                <br/>
<br/>
So much for a pre-game discussion about a PC.<br/>
<br/>
All of this is of course irrelevent to anything, but apparently it is needed to give an idea of what was going on.  I don't feel that it takes deep philosophical understanding of me as a person to realize in modern day settings you can not perpetrate violent acts without a degree of official investigation and or action regarding the subject.  I'm kooky that way.  Do you feel that after repeated incidents indicating that a character's actions are unacceptable in a society much like our own, that it would require a great deal of insght into the GM to understand possible reprecussions for a character.  So, yes a player can do what they want to do in game with their character, but they should be aware of possible outcomes. <br/>
<br/>
So, I'll not waste our time with further explanations of anecdotes involving people you probably don't know.                        </div>

No, I haven't approached non-gamers yet.  <br/>

Intriguing hints and vague allusions.  I'm an enigma just waiting to happen.  I really wasn't pitching to you all, as much as I was venting (or something that sounds a lot like pitching) about how difficult it is to find playtesters.  I've been happy with some of the suggestions I've received though. <br/>

<p>Here's the thing: I can certainly see how your player A's lack of a reasonable reaction to consequences gave the game trouble - lack of a reasonable reaction <em>for what you wanted the game to be.</em> But I can also see a reasonable case for someone stepping into a superhero game and thinking it'd play more like a violent, amoral cartoon than the grittier real-world morality play you seem to be interested in. Both are valid cultural reference points for what superheroes are "supposed" to play like. And I notice several points in the play outline above where you knew that what your players wanted would come into conflict with what you wanted, but you didn't say anything. They were waving giant flags and pointing to what they wanted.</p>
<p>I mean, if you want playtesters to stick with you, they have to be happy in the gaming experience. You may have to let it be <em>their game</em> a little more.</p>

                            Wow.<br/>
<br/>
So facilitating the creation of a team which was to allow them to be renegades was me setting them up and forcing them to organize another team?<br/>
Player B was right then.  Man.<br/>
<br/>
The NPC counseling discussion instead of being taken into custody to await a hearing or at least await the results of an investigation for removing someone's button pushing finger at mid-forearm for elevator opertion wasn't letting them be them and took them out of action?<br/>
<br/>
At some point in this topic, I think I asked whether or not I should just run gladiatorial combats instead of actual story-based games for playtesting various settings.  That must be what I should have done.  Because, allowing them to totally ignore the planned storylines, plots, and adventures in pursuit of forming another group composed of criminals was me not letting them pursue their ideas.  <br/>
<br/>
There are GMs out there who lead there players around by the nose from plot point to plot point to achieve a desired conclusion.  Also, there are GMs out there who introduce an event and just let the players craft the whole reason the event happened.  That's fine and dandy.  If they run a game in any other system or in my system it is their approach to a setting that influences outcomes.  There are points to be made that any RPG setting could be viewed as amoral without consequences.  How many GMs for D&amp;D worry about an Orc warrior's family plotting revenge on a raiding party of PCs, who were experience and treasure gathering?  I do.  Events in a story shouldn't happen in a vacuum without consequence or reaction.  Removing events from a social or cultural context in a game eliminates the need for the "role" in role-playing.    Stories should have some substance to them to actually be stories.  If someone is wanting to engage in a series of unrelated combats shouldn't they be playing a table-top wargame or an MMO"R"PG?  In a pencil and paper role-playing game, there is an inherent interface between narrative and improvisation.  If you have one without the other, then in my opinion you are missing the point.<br/>
<br/>
I think people have lost sight of there were three other players in that game that were fine with the setting and the system, but didn't want the constant conflict with the other players.  One left becuse he was criticized for figuring out a clue without rolling dice.  One stayed in the game until Player A brought in the amnesiac character after dumping the ninja.  This whole process consisted of him just showing up with the character and trying to insert it into the game without even letting me review the character, so another role-player was gone.  Then the final one who enjoyed the setting and my particular GMing style, stuck it out until the point when Player B and Player A decided I'd forced them on the path they chose.  If I had forced them to do anything it would have been to investigate what was going on, not plot ways to kill the most people possible. She was even willing to make a new character to join their renegades.  But, then the game ended because A and B had decided their job was done.  Had it not been a play-test, I would have just asked someone disruptive to leave a game.  But, I was hoping for genuine insights about the system.                        </div>

                            And to clarify, "Precursor" is a  traditional-format RPG.  I know this isn't the only way to game.  I have two other games in development currently.  "Ever After" is a game with less seperation between the the player who controls the antagonists and the player(s) that control the protagonist.  The system only supports 2-3 players though.  "Destination" is a very freeform game by it's nature, and the players build the world and their characters as they define what's around them.  I realize it may seem that I'm not a 'hippie' as it was put earlier in the topic, but there are games where the intent of the game is very open.  "Precursor" is focused, and no getting the setting right isn't a goal.  I've known game developers who were bent out of shape at letters they received saying the pet NPC was killed and how it happened.  That's not where I am.  I've known game developers who take the stance of I don't have to explain why this works this way.  I tend to explain, overly so, and I think that even though I railed against the statement when I heard it originally, that I might need to take the comment as advice.  <br/>
<br/>
I've got some more playtesters lined up for a post-apocalyptic setting in "Precursor" and we will see how it goes.                        </div>

                            g_q, take a step back, take a deep breath, get yourself a cup of coffee and a donut, re-lax.  I have been where you are a hundred times, all traditional GMs have, it's one of our great burdens. There is no need for stuff like: "So facilitating the creation of a team which was to allow them to be renegades was me setting them up and forcing them to organize another team?" and "Because, allowing them to totally ignore the planned storylines, plots, and adventures in pursuit of forming another group composed of criminals was me not letting them pursue their ideas." are uncalled for. That is not what misuba is saying in the slightest and you know it. You have been down this road before.<br/>
<br/>
You ran into a very simple and common problem of traditional play called the "assumption clash".  Ninja player, in hacking off the bad guy's hand, was assuming that the game would be a lot more freewheeling and violent than you did.  Saying "well, I told him that the world would be like our modern world and so he SHOULD have known" does not address the problem - remember the comics of the 90s, when "realistic" and "gritty" were the buzzwords, yet ultra-violence was just as casual and plots were just as flimsy?  You can say to a guy, "This is going to be a realistic style supers game." and he could have done exactly the same thing and believed that he was following your instruction.<br/>
<br/>
But you are not here to solve the problems in your game group, you are here to get help with playtesting your game, so I am going to take this in another direction from the usual discussion of techniques to prevent assumption clash:<br/>
<br/>
Put yourself in the shoes of a GM who is not you, running your game for the first time, getting into the elevator-situation you describe. He thinks, "Oh shit, this guy is going off the rails" or worse, "Cool, he must want to have a 'dressing down from the chief' scene, let me practice saying 'You're off the case' and 'meet your new partner'."  The problem then becomes known - the player is dismayed at having his ninja yelled at, the group is in a state of confusion and nobody is having fun.  In a state of high anxiety, the GM turns to your game, flipping through frantically looking for some way to solve this problem and get things back on track.<br/>
<br/>
What does he find?  What is in your game to help GMs avoid or solve questions of assumption clash?  <br/>
<br/>
Most mainstream games have a "talk about it with the players beforehand" suggestion.  A few others have methods for working things out if the talk-beforehand technique leaves a hole that nobody notices until the game falls into it.  What does your game have?  Both for preparation and for in-play jolts like the one you describe?                        </div>

                            Okay, here are some excerpts from chapters 1 - 5.  I'll have to split it up based on word count for the forums bear with me.  I'm trying to detail any non-system specific example that might vaguely apply to player and GM interaction, though I have included one of the specific examples pertaining to mechanics interpretation. <br/>
<br/>
Excerpts from various chapters:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
From the Introduction:<br/>
<br/>
What is a Role-Playing Game?<br/>
A role-playing game, or RPG, is a game in which the players take on the roles of fictional characters.  These characters interact within a fictional or imaginary setting.  However, RPGs are not easily pigeonholed due to the wide variety available.  A good deal of the experience of role-playing depends upon the other participants in the game.  Role-playing games can be as basic as running from one epic battle to the next, or can be riddled with politics and intrigue.  The referee of these games, or Game Master, has the greatest amount of influence over the tone of the game.  Other players can also affect the game tone through the actions of their characters.  So, a beginning player may want to find an established group and sit in on a few games before diving head first into role-playing.  Usually, game shops, hobby shops, or university fandom organizations will have open games which a beginner may observe.  This will give a new player the opportunity to find a group that appeals to her/his personal idea of role-playing.  <br/>
<br/>
In short, role-playing games can vary from small scale strategy war games to live action role-playing games (LARPs).  For the author's personal definition, role-playing games are a combination of narrative storytelling, improvisational acting, and random chance.  The weight of the storytelling falls to the Game Master (GM), it is her or his job to create, adapt, or present the plots, settings, and the non-player characters (NPCs) and interpret the rules of the system. The GMâ€™s plot or story line may have a few predetermined events, but the Game Master must also flexible and improvise in response to the players' choices.   <br/>
<br/>
....<br/>
<br/>
From World Building:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A basic starting point for all GMs or players is to decide what the genre or the nature of setting in which they wish to participate.  A GM decides on a genre and potentially a subgenre to use for a scenario or campaign and finds players interested in exploring that setting.  A player may seek out a GM running a particular type of game and should select a character suited to the genre and to her/his personal tastes.       <br/>
<br/>
....<br/>
<br/>
From Character Creation:<br/>
<br/>
The process of defining a character starts with understanding the setting the character will be interacting with in the game.  The GMâ€™s choice of genre, and decisions regarding the focus of the campaign or scenario should be a consideration during character creation process.  The participant should then determine a character concept.<br/>

Later from Character Creation:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Players and GMs may have an idea relating to utilizing an alternate Complimentary Characteristic in the calculation of a Statistic.  A player must discuss an alternate Characterisitc as a component with the GM and get the GM's approval.  The GM must consider all the implications of accepting these alternatives.<br/>
<br/>
Example:  A player comes to a GM and has purchased Increased Appearance for her/his PC.  The PC's appearance is at a rank 7.  The player wants to be able to use this high Appearance along with Vitality to compose the Endurance of the character.  This is meant to represent that the character is so<br/>
beautiful that people have a reluctance to mar the PC's appearance with combat action.   Thus the PC will have a high resistance to damage from people instinctively holding back.  On the surface this may sound<br/>
reasonable to a GM, but the game mechanics implication is that looking pretty makes it easier to climb a mountain.  This is because Endurance is used for figuring skill ranks, such as that of Climbing.  In this case, when considering Endurance based skills, a GM should not approve the proposed alternative.  <br/>
The GM could entertain letting the player use Appearance for the Physical Tag Defense or Physical Durability Defense combat data based on the "too pretty to hit syndrome" and then allow modifiers for different species when it comes to combat.  Or a GM might suggest the purchase of abilities to mitigate damage along with a character Trait: â€œFlawed Abilityâ€ to represent any species differences that could effect the damage to be inflicted.  This all would be contingent on GM approval  based on setting and campaign circumstances.  These options satisfy the concept of the player and can more easily work within a Game Masterâ€™s setting without breaking the mechanics of the system.  <br/>
<br/>
....<br/>
Even later from Character Creation:<br/>
<br/>
  Below are general guidelines for a series of special abilities for characters.  None of these abilities are guaranteed to be appropriate for every setting.  The Game Master has final say on which abilities, layering abilities, variants of abilities, and which Base Characteristics are acceptable in her/his campaign.  The GM may also rule that another Base Characteristic is appropriate for an ability.<br/>
<br/>
....<br/>
<br/>
From Action Resolution:<br/>
<br/>
The Game Master interprets the results of successes and failures in all Combat, Skill, and Statistic Challenges.  <br/>
<br/>
....<br/>
<br/>
From Gaming Etiquette:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Playerâ€™s Basic Right:  It is a playerâ€™s right to avoid and/or <br/>
leave any game that makes them uncomfortable due to subject matter, <br/>
genre, or group dynamics.  No one can force you to game in a group or <br/>
setting that makes you uncomfortable.  If you arenâ€™t having fun, then <br/>
even the social aspect of gaming will not be satisfactory.<br/>
<br/>
The Game Masterâ€™s Basic Right:  It is a Game Masterâ€™s right to run a <br/>
setting as he/she sees fit.  This does not supersede the playerâ€™s <br/>
right to not play in that setting, but it does mean that in the game <br/>
setting the Game Master determines the application of the rules.  <br/>
The rules of any system are up to the individual Game Masterâ€™s interpretation.  <br/>
This does not mean that a Game Master should be unwilling to listen to a playerâ€™s <br/>
concerns, but such concerns should be addressed outside of the game. <br/>
The only real exception to the Game Masterâ€™s right to run a campaign <br/>
as she/he chooses is covered below in The Hostâ€™s Right.<br/>
<br/>
The Hostâ€™s Basic Rights:  The host of the game, whether it be <br/>
someoneâ€™s home or a public place that allows people to game there, <br/>
has absolute say over the continuance of gaming in that area.  The <br/>
Game Master may not come into someoneâ€™s home or place of business and <br/>
force the host to endure a game which she/he/they do not want in <br/>
her/his/their home or business.  Also, the host has the right to <br/>
uninvite anybody from  her/his/their home or business that causes <br/>
them anxiety, frustration, or annoyance.                        </div>

                            FINER POINTS OF ROLE-PLAYING ETIQUETTE<br/>
<br/>
Know the Game Master/groupâ€™s â€œschool of gamingâ€:  Role-playing (in character oriented), <br/>
Hack-and-slash, or Tactical.  There are those who game to role-play <br/>
enjoy the improvisational acting aspects of gaming.  They will be as <br/>
content talking in the role of their character with another player <br/>
character or non-player character as when they are fighting for their <br/>
characterâ€™s beliefs and goals.  Hack-and-slash gamers typically want <br/>
combat for the sake of showing their characters'â€™ prowess and power over their <br/>
opponents.  Depth of character does not mean as much to these gamers <br/>
and some characterize them as â€œpower gamersâ€, "min-maxers" or <br/>
â€œmunchkinsâ€.  Such power gaming is not limited to young or <br/>
inexperienced gamers.  Tactical gamers enjoy the strategy of the <br/>
game.  They enjoy challenges to overcome, but for the most part do <br/>
not delve deeply into the psychology of the characters.  There is <br/>
really nothing wrong with any of these schools of play in and of <br/>
themselves.  The main thing is make sure that you know what you are <br/>
getting yourself into with a group.  Try to find people who enjoy the <br/>
same things you enjoy in a game.  This in itself will minimize <br/>
conflicts.<br/>
<br/>
Character issues are character issues; gamer issues are gamer issues.  The <br/>
main focus here is think of the characterâ€™s problems separate from the problems of<br/>
the day to day world. <br/>
<br/>
Any concerns with rulings should be addressed either directly with the Game Master <br/>
or with the entire group at an appropriate time.  The second way allows all <br/>
opinions and sides can be equally addressed.  Talking to other <br/>
members of the group about concerns before bringing them to the Game <br/>
Masterâ€™s attention is undermining to a game.  It can put stress on <br/>
friendships and could result in being excluded from future games or could precipitate the end<br/>
of the game entirely.<br/>
It is inappropriate to disagree with a Game Master over a ruling during <br/>
the game.  After the gaming session is over you can discuss it either <br/>
one on one with the Game Master or with the entire group.  There are notes throughout the sections indicating the Game Masterâ€™s ability to <br/>
interpret or ignore rules entirely.  A Game Master should not abuse this to single out<br/>
or humiliate any character in a setting.  A Game Master should be evenhanded.  Use the same rules for all your players. The idea of role-playing is to share a<br/>
gaming experience, and GMs should not attempt to intentionally defeat the players.  GMs have such influence over the setting that winning against the player characters is meaningless and not conducive to enjoyment of the role-playing experience.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, all participants should be courteous to the host and be a good guest.  Try to leave the area in which game was held in the same condition as when the game started.<br/>
<br/>
----------------<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so most of that was written a few years ago and hasn't been edited, so forgive any grammatical gaffs.  Now, I think that covers most everything that might even remotely apply to how I've addressed finding a group that you get along with, while reiterating the GMs ability to interpret the system as he/she sees fit.  <br/>
<br/>
As to previous posts, try reading with an exasperated inflection, not an agitated one.  I realized that it could be misconstrued as agitation, and added the post about other gaming styles to try and defuse a misconception.  It, of course, failed.                        </div>

                            g_q, get specific. Really specific.  You didn't just have some generalized la dee da problem, you had a specific real-world real-life problem. (I am starting to think you had a really GOOD playtest session considering how important this problem obviously is to you!)<br/>
<br/>
Do you see any holes in the text you've presented that might be filled in order to give guidance to a GM who ended up in your shoes?  (For example, I don't think a GM looking for guidance on your ninja-player problem would immediately go to the character generation or world building section. Do you agree?)<br/>
<br/>
From looking at this it appears that the options endorsed by these guidelines for the ninja player who hacks off the guy's hand, thinking that the game was freewheeling and violent, then discovers that the game is not like that, and is dissatisfied are:<br/>
<br/>
1. Stay quiet for the rest of the session (game?), then bring it up afterwards to the very person who has already made the decision they feel is wrong, who is under no obligation to agree, compromise, or even listen.<br/>
2. Stand up and leave.<br/>
<br/>
Do you see other options presented to him?                        </div>

                            Ironically 97% of this was written before the playtest and was in the information provided to the playtesters.  Go figure.  <br/>
<br/>
It does state to the GM that they should consider the feedback but doesn't tie the GMs hands, it also suggests talking with the entire group after the session.  But, if the player isn't enjoying the game, why should he stay and disrupt it for others? <br/>
<br/>
Since apparently I'm due for enlightenment it's time for some clarification from everyone else:<br/>
<br/>
Should players disrupt the flow of a game to argue rules sets? <br/>
<br/>
Should players secretly discuss their problems with the other members of the group, leaving the GM unaware of the concerns? (Keeping in mind that other players have the same level of influence on the GMs interpetation of the rules.) <br/>
<br/>
How do those actions better the play experience for anyone?  <br/>
<br/>
How would you characterize your personal approach to a player who repeatedly ignores in-character reprecussions for actions?<br/>
<br/>
Not only had I provided information to the players based on the system, but also a number of hand-outs regarding the setting, and pre-game discussions about tone and character (as I mentioned a diuscussion between me and Player a about Ninja versus Super Hero Ninja earlier).<br/>
<br/>
What steps should I have used beyond that? <br/>
<br/>
Where do you see a non-GM participant's responsibility in a game?                        </div>

Thom, it totally depends on the game.  Totally, profoundly, and absolutely.  The fact that you think there's a universal answer to the question is the gigantic swirling vortex of a blindspot that's making this so difficult for you.<br/><br/>What's a non-GM do in your game?  That's a far more important question -- and more importantly, it's one that has an answer.  Or should.                        </div>

                            JBR is dead on target.  I honestly don't care how you answer those questions for your game, in the sense that you're seeking playtest info at this point. (I will eventually care if I try to make a decision to buy your game, but we're not remotely near that point yet.)  Neither he nor I nor anyone in this thread is trying to make your game something you don't want it to be.  But I, with hand on heart, solemnly declare, that SOMEONE who plays your game is going to have a similar problem as you had with ninja-player, and agonize over it as much or more as you are. Thus, your playtest was not bad, it was very, very, very good.  So those questions you're asking should be answered as directly and specifically as possible in the text, and they should be answered in light of your experience with playtesting this with the ninja-player. <br/>
<br/>
So you had a pre-game discussion and pre-game handouts you thought should solve this problem - and they didn't. I gar-ron-damn-tee that someone else is going to be in the same boat. Now's your chance to reach out to them!  If your answer is "kick that disruptive asshole out of the group and demand they never darken your door again", give that answer clearly and specifically.  If your answer is "let them stew in their own misery until they exercise their right to leave or play along with the rest of the group", say that too. Whatever your answer is, give it!<br/>
<br/>
And why not go back to the players and ask more questions about their experience?  In writing if not in person.<br/>
<br/>
Edit: I feel like the mainstream RPG ambassador here some days..."Hail from the shores of guns and explosions and passing out XP for killing orcs."                        </div>

                            To Joshua BishopRoby and JDCorley:  Here-in lies the rub. 1) It does depend on my game.  2) I've outlined where the player's responsibilities are in my game. 3) The answer doesn't seem satisfactory, so obviously there are insights that you have that I do not.   <br/>
<br/>
I'll summarize the two things that are my honest opinion about this.  If I'm personally running the game, the player has the responsibility to read key points about a setting and create a character that would either be able to function in the society described or be able to function in the context of the setting in the role of a "fringe" person (a paranoid, lunatic, mad prophet, town drunk, communal hippie, village idiot, hermit, whatever).  But the responsibility is contextual.  The second part of this answer is, I'm not (in theory) the only person who will be running a game in this system and I really can't pre-judge someone's GMing style, the players they have access to, and their connection to these players.  Their answer will be different based on these factors.  <br/>
<br/>
Moving from responsibilities to rights.  For other GMs results may vary and trying to give overly specific advice about disruptive players such as "kick them to the curb" or "just ignore them until they leave on their own" isn't exactly what I've said or what I've done.  If a player isn't having fun, why are they continuing to come to a game, which is supposed to be fun?  What's wrong about saying, if you're not having fun you don't have to play?  Because, that is the basic idea of the player's rights statement.<br/>
<br/>
It would be futile to try and anticipate every interpersonal conflict that may occur over a GMs decision in a variety of settings.  Saying the GM can ignore, interpret, modify, or create rules specific to his campaign or setting is a definite statement.  There's no ambiguity in it.  Saying the GM is responsible for putting these changes in a written "house rules" set is also a definite.  Saying that rules are to be applied consistently is another definite.  Everything else is between the GM and his group.  There should be a courteous relationship between the various participants of the game.  <br/>
<br/>
JDCorley: Specifically, why I won't ask the disruptive players for more feedback is that the feedback had nothing to do with mechanics, which is the actual concern and there has been a break of over a year since it occured as there was a prolonged illness resulting in the death of a family member that required my attention.  I do feel that you are over-stating the impact on me personally of the disruptive Ninja-player.  I made a vague complaint about situations that shut down playtests and that it left me wondering about the nature of playtesting and some assumptions were made.  I tried to explain why one assumption was erroneous and several more arrived to take it's place.  The more detail I give, the more impact you assign an incident that was a minor frustration.  I honestly didn't really know the guy.  He responded to a playtest open call I had.  He knew Player B through an online MMO they played and were in the same guild.  Player A (The Ninja-player) was new to role-playing.  Player B (The "organize another PC team" player) claimed to have years of experience with RPGs.  I had known him back in high-school in the 80s and he did game at that time, so I had no reason to doubt his assertions.  What left me wondering was, why there was no feedback on the mechanics?  Why was it all about ramifications of in-character actions, not thge success or failure based on the system engine?  I know the system is far from flawless, but the fault finding assigned to the system being "broken" was all about character interaction.  I can accept that I don't make kill crazed PCs happy with my settings, but I wanted mechanics data.    <br/>
<br/>
But to clarify, which will ultimately cause another misunderstanding with this track record, I was far more frustrated by the lack of playtesters in the area currently than the minor annoyance of a hack-and-slasher who either wouldn't pay attention to details or was apathetic to them.  I've managed to find a few players, so even that frustration has been lessening.  <br/>
<br/>
Suggestions made earlier in the topic as to attracting playtesters and GMs proved to be very helpful.  So, huzzah to you JDCorley for that advice.                <br/>
---<br/>
<br/>
Now, back to some questions.  These were not system specifc and I'd really sincerely like to know your point of view on them since my ideas on the topics are perhaps outmoded, so I'll repeat them.<br/>
<br/>
Should players disrupt the flow of a game to argue rules sets? <br/>
<br/>
Should players secretly discuss their problems with the other members of the group, leaving the GM unaware of the concerns? (Keeping in mind that other players have the same level of influence on the GMs interpetation of the rules.) <br/>
<br/>
How do those actions better the play experience for anyone?                        </div>

                            All right. I didn't mean to derail your thread. If all you are asking about is system, then this assumption clash stuff is a red herring.  For system feedback I would assure that your playtest scenario showcases the piece of system that you want tested, preferably more than once.  If it's combat you want tested, put in a few combats, if it's a chase system, put in some chases.  Tell the players "this is a playtest of the combat (or whatever) system, pay careful attention to these parts" and then prepare your after-game questions to focus on specifics: was that system fair? Evocative? Complex enough? Too complex? Fun on its own?<br/>
<br/>
If you are satisfied with how your game handles assumption clash, that's awesome. I'm just saying that your playtest DID give you information, really important information. When you talked to the players afterwards, you found that they were so highly engaged in this cool setting you evoked that when there was a perceived gap, they filled it in themselves (unfortunately, it didn't match what you had put in that gap.)                        </div>

<p>I don't think players should disrupt the game for rules arguments, but knowing that they <em>will</em> is one of those opportunities masquerading as problems. <em>Burning Wheel</em> handles it with Duel of Wits, <em>Agon</em> handles it with Orate, and I know of a D20 campaign that has instituted a "screw you, I'm awesome" house rule for when a PC attempts something heroic but is shot down by a rules technicality: you may spend one "screw you, I'm awesome" token per game session to take your action anyway. If you add a rule that gives that kind of power to players, you take the same power away from rules lawyers, and that is a very good thing.</p>
<p>Similarly, players will sometimes think they have to hide information from a GM. There are numerous ways to try to combat this in the rules - <em>With Great Power</em> recommends an actual, physical "thought balloon" to hold above your head and voice your concerns - but I think the best approach is the one in <em>Dogs in the Vineyard,</em> which boils down to "set the example by sharing information with the players that the characters might not have." Treat your players a little bit like co-directors, and they will tend to step up to the responsibility for the story.</p>
<p>The one thing I'm still grappling with is not being able to find gamers. I almost just want to say that gaming is like, say, modern dance - it's simply become too esoteric a thing to find lots of appreciators outside of major metropolitan areas. But really, I think that we can, and must, make lots of new RPG participants, but we may have to change our games - or at least answer some hard questions - to draw them in, and we may have to accept that they will not necessarily call themselves "gamers" when we're done.</p>

                            Thanks misuba.<br/>
<br/>
To the mechanical manifestation, such as the house rule mentioned for D20, I had an element briefly in the game called "Cinematic Edge" that allowed the players to use it for one of five things to better there characters' situation.  Ultimately I removed it, because there are a number of factors in the system that already compensated in the players' favor mechanically.  I might reintroduce it for one session in the upcoming post-apocalyptic setting.  I am waiting to hear back from some potential GMs to run it independently of me.  That will be a relief.   The "free dinner" feedback session that JDCorley suggested has certainly gotten some attention from local GMs, though the fact that timeshares and will attorneys use this approach has two of them questioning what they are signing on for.  I'm drafting agreements for them.   <br/>
<br/>
Interpersonal player relationships, I don't feel there's a really good way to legislate that.  Honestly, saying here's basic rights for people involved in the game is as far as I'll take that.  There's a really dry psychology paper that could be written around the concept, but it won't be me.    <br/>
<br/>
As to the lack of gamers (and therefore playtesters) situation, I think the "Hey, you're role-playing" approach the Jason Morningstar is utilizing is probably the best example of how to catch their interest.  Sort of guerrilla role-playing.  I've also noticed that the dyed-in-the-wool gaming groups tend to be very cliquish and do not want to allow younger players in their groups.  Were there an organization that supported younger players, along the lines of scouting, then we would see less attrition in gaming youth.  However, the siren call of the internet lures many of the potential players into MMOGs masquerading as MMORPGs.  But that's a rant for another day.  My "Ever After" project is a gateway RPG-sort-of and its appeal is generally towards the Disney-set.                        </div>
