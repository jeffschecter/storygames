This is not about any particular situation that I am in currently, just a general statement on "A" gaming outlook.)<br/><br/>So, a GM has a story that he wants to tell. Not as "Part" of the game, but as the "Whole" game. They are not quite railroading, as you can take many tracks, but you will always arrive at the same station. Now, lets say that he puts a lot of effort into it, and it is a good story. <br/><br/>Is it rude to just tell him that this is not what you do for a role playing game, it is what you do for a book? Now, go write that book so that we can get back to the RP. (well maybe you could say it in nicer way, but you get the picture)<br/><br/>This is often what I want to tell my GM's. I don't know, I tend to see this time, and time again, where the GM has a "Story" to tell, and it irks me to no end. I am usually the one running the game, about %95 of the time, and it just baffles me when a player asks me after a game "So, what did you have in mind for how that would play out?" In a situation like that all that I can think of is, do I tell him the character did not even exist until about 30sec before you started talking to her, and that I did not have a "Story" in mind, that his actions created the character only moment before? Or, lie to him and make him think that I had some sort of master plan?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329180/#Comment_329180" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-11T19:39:28+00:00" title="June 11, 2011  7:39PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It would be rude.

It was frustrating for me. Then I discovered people who didn't GM this way and games that didn't allow for that type of GMing and all of a sudden I was in love with RPGs again! <br/><br/>During my honeymoon stage, I was so in love (and granted young), I couldn't understand how people enjoyed pre-fixed GM stories. But I was wrong. I run a local gaming social club and have connections with hundreds of gamers. I often run polls and time and time again, I've found that large numbers of people want to play in a GM's story. Not even just gamers who are used to it, some people new to gaming also want the GM to tell them a story and make limited choices within the confines of that story's structure. <br/><br/>Ultimately I came to realize, there wasn't a right or wrong way, just different play styles. <br/><br/>You asked, "is it rude to just tell him that this is not what you do for a role playing game, it is what you do for a book, now go write that book so that we can get back to the RP?"<br/><br/>I would say yes. His RP style is fairly common, so I would feel strange saying he is doing it wrong. And if there are people who enjoy it, how could it be wrong?<br/><br/>Your style of play sounds like fun to me! I suspect we would have fun gaming together. But it isn't fun for everyone. Different people like different things and that's totally cool. Now if a GM says there isn't a pre-fixed story and your choices matter, and then they quietly makes sure your choices don't matter and don't ruin their plot behind the scenes\u2026 then I think that is uncool. It\u2019s one thing to want different things, it's another to lie about it and not respect your friend's wants.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ODDin" title="ODDin"><img alt="ODDin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ODDin">ODDin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329235/#Comment_329235" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-12T09:47:44+00:00" title="June 12, 2011  9:47AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You should certainly talk about this, because you're playing games in order to enjoy them, and if you don't enjoy the style of the game you're in, you should do something about it.<br/>However, this doesn't mean the playstyle you described is inherently wrong or "not RP", as you put it.

The GM is also a nice person in general and offered to drive most of us home. On the drive home, the rest of the players kept praising the game and wanted to know the GM's secrets. "You did a great job keeping us focused on your story, we need to get better at that when we run games, tell us your secrets!" I was the only one in the car who wanted a different experience. And that's ok, except for the part where the GM lied to me to get me to play. But remove me from the picture and the game was perfectly functional. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MatrixGamer</cite>You have a different play style from this GM.

I've also seen this a bit. Players sometimes feel uncomfortable when they realize the GM doesn't have the story pre-planned. <br/><br/>From an immersion stand point, some feel it's not real if we are just making it up. Of course when we talk immersion, different people feel immersed by different things and there is no standard. <br/><br/>But a lot of players also like the "GM tells the story" style who don't care about immersion. I've seen this with new players. They find the activity fun but don't want to take it too seriously and having the GM do most of the heavy lifting allows them to sit back, hang out, and focus on the parts they enjoy with minimal work. I would guess that many people on Story Games dislike video game cut scenes or linear video game stories. But a lot of top selling, positively reviewed games have these features. People like different things and that's ok. That all said, that's why I love Story Games and indie games in general as they give us more options to support different styles of play (even those that are less financially viable).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rune" title="Rune"><img alt="Rune" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rune">Rune</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329336/#Comment_329336" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-13T07:11:32+00:00" title="June 13, 2011  7:11AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quite a few years back (before I knew the indie/story-game movement even existed) I was in a group playing Shadowrun on a weekly basis. We were two players that shared the duty of GM'ing. I put a lot of time into preparing adventures (runs) for the other players, and looking back on it they seemed to love my "railroaded" adventures (of course I can't be 100% sure, but all the signs were there, smiles and enthusiasm, positive discussions of the game after hand, and anticipation towards next weeks game aso).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other gm were very variable, sometimes he prepared, but other times he came totally unprepared to the table, and allowed us to do whatever we/our characters pleased. That was rarely well received, and I remember players telling me afterwards that if that GM did not have some adventure planned next time they would consider skipping the game next week. Letting the players do what they wanted with the story led to a dull and uninteresting game for that group, they were there to be guided through the gm's story and see the big reveal at the end.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I have played and read a lot of story-games, and I still meet the scepticism of more traditional players when I try to explain that we "make the story up as we go". I've had questions like "So there is no adventure then?" followed by a disinterested shrug when I confirmed that there was no pre-written structure to follow.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still play more traditional and railroaded games regularly and enjoy them quite a bit, but it's not hard to see that some people prefer one or the other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329341/#Comment_329341" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-13T07:33:58+00:00" title="June 13, 2011  7:33AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would add that perception is everything.

Nick has written for both WotC and Paizo in the past and his stuff is very well received. <br/><br/>Anyway, Nick's game had 11 players. And whenever you rolled for something, Nick basically looked at the dice and told you what happened, including the description of your character's actions. Nick was flying by the seat of his pants and making it up as he went along, but the input from the players was fairly miniscule. This was Nick's show and we were the audience. <br/><br/>And you know what? Jared and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. We even said to each other as we were walking away that Nick basically did many of the things we hate in roleplaying games. But it was great because <i>Nick</i> is a fantastic storyteller. Body language, voices, descriptions, plot twists...he's excellent at all of it. But the other side of that coin is that if it had been anyone less entertaining than Nick, we both would have left that table within five minutes of sitting down.<br/><br/>It was kind of an eye-opening experience. We both walked away with a much better understanding of why people might enjoy an experience like that.<br/><br/>Personally, I prefer to play in games that are more responsive to players' choices, but I can appreciate the fun in playing the other way...if someone like Nick is the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329416/#Comment_329416" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-13T12:24:05+00:00" title="June 13, 2011 12:24PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's also the idea of WHERE the story is located.

The investigators are taking actions that uncover the story usually up until the final moments where they likely intercede directly in the story's final moments.<br/><br/>This is sort of related to some stuff I really noticed in the D&amp;D Essentials material.  Kevin Weiser once described D&amp;D is "Overcoming challenges in exotic locales".  I think that "exotic locales" part is REALLY super important.  A lot of the fun is in uncovering history and lore about the ruins you're in and seeing how that pieces together with the motivations of the NPC villains even those villains are just boss fights at the end.  This is very video game like but there's a lot of fun to be had in it.  You do that across multiple locations and NPCs and you end up with a very interesting interwoven campaign with twists and reveals that totally not dependent on the PCs taking particular actions.  They just have to explore and be curious.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329434/#Comment_329434" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-13T13:15:06+00:00" title="June 13, 2011  1:15PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thor O</cite>A few years ago (at Origins, I think), Jared Sorensen and I sat in on a game of Marvel Superheroes run by our friend Nick Logue. Nick has written for both WotC and Paizo in the past and his stuff is very well received.<br/><br/>Anyway, Nick's game had 11 players. And whenever you rolled for something, Nick basically looked at the dice and told you what happened, including the description of your character's actions. Nick was flying by the seat of his pants and making it up as he went along, but the input from the players was fairly miniscule. This was Nick's show and we were the audience.<br/><br/>And you know what? Jared and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. We even said to each other as we were walking away that Nick basically did many of the things we hate in roleplaying games. But it was great because<i>Nick</i>is a fantastic storyteller. Body language, voices, descriptions, plot twists...he's excellent at all of it. But the other side of that coin is that if it had been anyone less entertaining than Nick, we both would have left that table within five minutes of sitting down.<br/><br/>It was kind of an eye-opening experience. We both walked away with a much better understanding of why people might enjoy an experience like that.<br/><br/>Personally, I prefer to play in games that are more responsive to players' choices, but I can appreciate the fun in playing the other way...if someone like Nick is the GM.</blockquote>\nGreat story! <br/><br/>Nick is indeed special (a 2 time fullbright winner, world theater professor, world class martial artist, 18+ years of acting and stage fighting experience).

You have to take away a great deal and use a lot of illusionism in order for an RPG to sink to that level\u2014and, as pointed out upthread, there are many other things that can be wrong with a game besides simple railroading.  But it certainly is possible.<br/><br/>Also, I completely understand peoples' skepticism about the "reality" of the game-world if there's *nothing* pre-planned.  I do like games that are purely create-as-you-go but for certain styles of game, particularly a lot of adventure games, I think the GM having pre-planned material can be really helpful.  It can even be necessary, for instance in the case of Rune's ShadowRun game.  I've played in some really great games where the GM had a lot of pre-prepared material and was absolutely faithful to it; I've done it myself a time or two.<br/><br/>But wanting the GM to have pre-planned material is a far cry from a true railroad where the players' decisions make no meaningful impact whatsoever (and, yes, such games are extreme examples, but they do exist!).  In fact, IME real railroading means disregarding some of your prep because you have to be dishonest about stats and dice rolls.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I get not wanting meta input into the game!  Again, I've played in some great games where the expectation was for everyone to be in actor stance the whole time as much as possible.<br/><br/>So, let's take the most classic example of a pre-planned, linear set of encounters (and using a game system with little to no meta input from the players)\u2014\xe0 la most 4E modules.  (Leaving aside for the moment the fact that there are legit questions about whether or not 4E-as-played-by-many-groups is actually an RPG.)  The clear rubric for me of "whether or not this is actually an RPG or just a railroad*" is whether there are real consequences for failed dice rolls or failed encounters.  If things just continue as they would have otherwise... why did we bother to have that encounter again?<br/><br/>I bring this up because of Zac in Virginia's thing about his friend's 3.5 game.  My fear there is that the only time the players will get to have any meaningful impact is in combat\u2014which is fine for certain playstyles\u2014<i>and</i> the combats will be meaningless, not in the narrative sense, but mechanically meaningless.  I don't know\u2014I hope I'm wrong.<br/><br/>Matt<br/><br/>*Again, I'm <i>not</i> saying that all RPGs have to have huge amounts of meta-level player input into what the game is about or anything like that.  I'm simply saying that if all meaningful outcome axes are pre-determined (which, again, can mean things other than simply the "plot"), then it's not really much of a game, is it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329545/#Comment_329545" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T00:07:26+00:00" title="June 14, 2011 12:07AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What do people reckon is the best value for buck in terms of preparation for GMing a session?<br/><br/>At the moment Im thinking its <b>working on a cast of NPCs and their motivations and goals.</b> <br/><br/>But Im interested in hearing otherwise, or '<i>yes and...</i>'                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329569/#Comment_329569" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T06:09:39+00:00" title="June 14, 2011  6:09AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would have to say the same.

Then whenever you need to name a character during a game, pull out your list, pick a first and a last name, and you're done.

Write down the best stuff you come up with, and revisit it a few times before the game to refresh your memory of it and to refine your ideas.

And I'm not even talking about playing <i>The Great Pendragon Campaign</i>. But let's assume we're using it. The cast of NPCs and their motivations are pretty much set. And generally, there is "an adventure." It might be chasing down the Saxon attacking a nearby town. It might be going off to meet with a witch to see if she can help lift a curse on a local keep. But there's a thing you do, and you go do it.<br/><br/>So, what is the best bang for the buck in prepping <i>Pendragon</i>? You're looking for <i>tests</i> of Traits and Passions. Each Player Knight has Character Traits and Passions of such high a value that they can be tested to see if the Knight is going to do something compulsively, and often against his best interest, because that's who he is. And even if the Player Knight is not compelled to make a roll to determine behavior, by making a choice between two opposed Traits, the Knight must make a check beside that behavior and see if that behavior goes up during the Winger Phase. <br/><br/>By being tested, we learn who the Knight is. Which is a big part of the game.<br/><br/>So, knowing you have an adventure, solid prep is making to lay in moments where the Knights must choose to behave one way or another. Finding ways of doing that, sometimes tailored for the Knights on key Traits or Passions, sometimes not, is a really valuable part of <i>Pendragon</i> prep. It is where a lot of the game is going to shine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329777/#Comment_329777" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T18:21:08+00:00" title="June 14, 2011  6:21PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Supposing we look at Steve's question this way - AW suggests both that you create PC-NPC-PC triangles (a bit like Stefoid's r-map) and lists of threats.

I have prepped a lot of games, i've gotten better at doing it as i did so.  Most of the 'improvement' in prepping a game comes from knowing your players and what they want and making it happen in ways that both excite and surprise them.<br/><br/>Generally speaking (with a host of caveats i cannot list) i believe "the more you put yourself into something (thinking, musing, practicing, loving, prepping) the better it will be."  I see Prep for a Game as just putting more effort into the thing.  The payoff is equal to your effort.  And i realize, at the same time, it can just be you digging your own grave.  I've had more than a few games where i was super-certain that the players were going to love whatever element i'd prepared only to have them 'derail' things by going in a whole new direction.

Whatev. I'm going to keep scouting the strontium junkyard for my missing mutant dog" then you escalate - "Big Bob's kidnapped Daisy" - now they've got that hard choice you were looking for.<br/><br/><br/>(Totally unrelated side note on bang prep: something I realized in the mall the other day is if a parent has two children and they run off in opposite directions - bang.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329941/#Comment_329941" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T10:46:32+00:00" title="June 15, 2011 10:46AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Keep in mind that while some people define Bang can be defined as a <i>dilemma</i> ("A situation in which a difficult choice has to be made between two or more alternatives, esp. equally undesirable ones") that's often a limited, small way to go with them. Certainly I don't use them that way. <br/><br/>It's just a moment that demands action or a choice in one way or another, tied to things that the character (and thus, the Player) cares about. <br/><br/>Jumping from dilemma to dilemma often feels artificial, constrained, scratchy and strange, in my opinion. And, certainly, that's not how Bangs were defined in <i>Sorcerer</i>, where the term comes from.<br/><br/>Of course, people should use Bangs however they think is best and is most effective for fun at the table.<br/><br/>A Bang from last night, in the <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i> game I'm running:<br/><br/>Giaus, Priest of the Goddess of Death, started off at the last session to find the home of gods of humans his empire are fighting. He wants to know their origin. He had sent the Goddess of Death along with his acolyte as she travelled back to the Fortress in the woods.<br/><br/>At the start of the session, as Jesse describes Giaus heading into forest, he describes how he's using the Link he has with the Goddess to make sure Lucia's journey to the Fortress is going well. I say, "No. You sense fear. You sense the stench of orc blood. The Goddess of Death is rushing back to you."<br/><br/>I didn't describe much more. But I don't have to. Now Giaus, knowing something unexpected has occurred, needs to take action. There are many actions he can take.<br/><br/>I see Bangs like a truck that comes along and rushing into the side of your car as your driving through an intersection: sometimes you see it coming, sometimes it is in the moment of smashing, and sometimes the accident has already occurred. But always you're left with, "Okay, right now, what are you doing?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329962/#Comment_329962" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T11:47:28+00:00" title="June 15, 2011 11:47AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>And, certainly, that's not how Bangs were defined in<i>Sorcerer</i>, where the term comes from.</blockquote>\nOh?

Just this: You think you're traveling one way -- whether that's about a relationship, a plan of action, a goal, an expected victory, a day simply going well -- and something comes along to change the expectations/facts/situation.<br/><br/>I had a Bang in a Sorcerer game where the PC found out his wife had been cheating on him. That's a Bang: Now what?<br/><br/>(I'm pretty sure the truck analogy in my head actually comes from the opening moments of the pilot of SIX FEET UNDER, when the bus strikes the father's car. That moment is a BANG in everyone else's life, and launches lots of responses and choices for the characters... But none of it is a physical threat.)<br/><br/><br/>I think the "dilemma" thing comes about because a lot of EXAMPLES of Bangs have been dilemmas. Stripped of any context of the actual players, characters or situation of actual game, dilemmas offer an easy way of saying, "Something like this."  This is why, in my view, the "moral choices" of video games are usually so blunt. Lacking any knowledge of what might be a compelling moment of reflection and choices of behavior for the player holding the controller, we say, "Well, do you want to do the good thing or the bad thing?" The lack of any context leads to extremes to differentiate choices. In the intimacy of actual play with real people who have made clear what their interested in playing in, however, Bangs can be much more tailored and subtle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
