I helped Fred put it together, designing the logo and helping to recruit booths outside the post-Forge community, but he definitely deserves most of the credit.  I hope somebody, somewhere counted how many passports were actually turned in fully stamped, because that would be a nice figure to know.<br><br>Next year, I have a few thoughts for making it work better.<br/><br/>1. Do a better job of reaching out to non-Forge indie games people earlier.  I think we might have been able to get several other booths involved (Pagan, Apophis, etc.) given more time.  Key20 and IPR-affiliated companies is certainly a start, but we could definitely make it a more widespread thing.  We could also have done a better job of promoting other artists, like Keith, who've done work on indie games.<br/><br/>2. Allow people to keep their stamped passports afterwards, since it's basically a list of game companies that they could buy from or learn more about after the con is over.  Maybe there's just a inserted half-sheet where they fill out their contact info and have a booth member sign off that they've gotten all the stamps.  So they stick that half-sheet in the box and keep the stamped passport.<br/><br/>3. Figure out a better way to present the map, especially if we're going to have more booths involved next year.<br/><br/>4. Like John said, see if we can get it mentioned in the con booklet, as an activity con visitors can take part in.<br/><br/>5. Like Justin said, add in a stamp for attending one of the various indie games seminars featuring Luke, Jared, Paul Tevis, Sons of Kryos, etc.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89496/#Comment_89496" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-22T10:50:27+00:00" title="August 22, 2007 10:50AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought the passport was a superb idea.

I would have never bought my girls the Hamsters from the Engel Matrix guy, or been clued onto Victoriana or Colonial Gothic (both possible future purchases) or talked to someone long enough to work out how Games on Demand worked or indeed taken the opportunity to really look around the art show (which was beautiful).<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe next year add an added little extra (maybe a special draw) for those that complete the entire thing?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other thing - maybe have a list of the prize winners posted at the Forge/IPR booth?

So, at least in that literal sense, someone who completes it does get something extra. But, if you're talking about something even <i>more</i> extra, I think that's a neat idea too. Maybe something as simple as an extra entry in the prize pull.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/blankshield" title="blankshield"><img alt="blankshield" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.blankshieldpress.com/jamesgoplay.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/blankshield">blankshield</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89511/#Comment_89511" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-22T11:25:02+00:00" title="August 22, 2007 11:25AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of my only regrets at Gencon this year was that I didn't take the time to do a passport of my own.<br><br>James                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89522/#Comment_89522" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-22T12:01:50+00:00" title="August 22, 2007 12:01PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2007 5:03PM by Jogesh EZ.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kat Miller</cite>This Passport was a wonderful thing.<br>I don't know if I'd have found Keith or whoever was in the 500 booths without that passport!<br>I don't know if it helped people find G.o.D. but I loved my stamp.<br>I just want to take a moment to Thank Fred and Evil Hat.</br></br></br></blockquote>\nYeah, I have to agree, especially with the "finding Keith" thing.
