BAM!" That sounds promising (27 replies), but I can't find the text of the thread, just the title.<br/><br/>For example, you can see it here:<br/><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010418141009/www.gamingoutpost.com/forums/index.cfm?Action=ShowForum&amp;ccurrentforum=26&amp;site=GO" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://web.archive.org/web/20010418141009/www.gamingoutpost.com/forums/index.cfm?Action=ShowForum&amp;ccurrentforum=26&amp;site=GO</a><br/><br/>But I don't even know for sure if that was the main thread for the contest.<br/><br/>Any help anyone could offer in this search would be greatly appreciated.<br/><br/>I'm mainly interested in the following details:<br/><br/>What was the contest called?<br/>What were the rules?<br/>How many games were submitted?<br/>Who won? What were the game(s) called?<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226041/#Comment_226041" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-19T18:21:54+00:00" title="August 19, 2009  6:21PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            P.S.

I haven't been over there since shortly after I got over here, so I couldn't speak to the situation there. I do know that they had some problems with the archives, but can't say whether or not it affected any of the competitions.<br/><br/>That all said, they were small, being instituted by anyone at any time. They also had all sorts of different criteria, so you had one with a 24 hour limit, and another with 28, another with a week. And the limits changed from competition to competition as well. So the results tended to be light in number and content.<br/><br/>Still, I'm sure that one or two of the games were diamonds in the rough, and wouldn't mind links to them. I personally did two myself that I can remember. One was an action game called "Final Fight!" that had some similarities to Extreme Vengeance (but single layered, and even more single minded). The other I can't even remember the name of, but it was a horror game that had a nifty mechanic where you determined from a roll half way through the game whether or not your character was going to die in the latter half.<br/><br/>I doubt that either are worth checking out, really.<br/><br/>Mike</blockquote>\nWhich may be relevant to you?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226129/#Comment_226129" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-20T06:03:45+00:00" title="August 20, 2009  6:03AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Jack!
