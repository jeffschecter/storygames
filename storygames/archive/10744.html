The most obvious example is Roald Dahl's Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, but perhaps also C. S. Lewis' Narnia stories (ugh), Lewis Carroll's Alice In Wonderland and...wait...what's the other one I was thinking of...no, it's gone.<br/><br/>But I'm confused what the game will actually be <i>about</i>. It's all very well being somewhere wonderful, but what do you actually do when you're there? I want to steer clear of moral lessons (definitely) and self-discovery (probably).<br/><br/>So help me break it down. What are these stories actually about? Do you just explore the land or is something else going on?<br/><br/>Respond slowly and thoughtfully, please.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238281/#Comment_238281" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-20T04:33:17+00:00" title="October 20, 2009  4:33AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The very basic young children's story is leaving home, encountering and dealing with mild peril, then returning home safe to parents.<br/>\nFor older children the peril can be quite nasty, and they can return changed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238280/#Comment_238280" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-20T04:34:42+00:00" title="October 20, 2009  4:34AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 20, 2009 7:35AM by GB_Steve.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_fantasy" rel="nofollow">Here</a>'s a link.<br/><br/>The Water Babies is about dying and going to a better place.<br/>Alice just seems a fun nonsense story, an excuse for Carroll to poke fun at things.<br/>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a morality tale about how everyone gets what they deserve.<br/>Narnia is about how if you wear tights, you're going to hell.

Here's a summary of the plot:\n<blockquote>James is a little boy who becomes an orphan and goes to live with his two mean and wicked aunts in an old house on a high hill, who make him work all day and never let him play with any other kids. One day, he's given a bag of magic crocodile tongues by a strange old man, but James trips and spills the bag by an old withered peach tree, which produces a single peach. The peach grows and grows, until it's as big as a house, and the wicked old aunts build a fence around it and charge admission. After all the sight-seers have gone for the day, they send James out to clean up the garbage that's been left. He finds a hole in the peach and crawls in. The hole is the entrance to a tunnel that leads to the stone, which has been made into a parlor where James meets bugs that have been transformed by the magic of the crocodile tongues just like the peach: a vaudevillean Centipede, a querulous Earthworm, a stuffy old Grasshopper, and more. The peach, grown enormous, snaps the tether holding it to the tree and rolls down the hill. It crushes the aunts and rolls all the way across the countryside and into the sea. James and his friends use Miss Spider's silk to lasso a flock of seagulls, which lift the peach into the air. They drift across the Atlantic Ocean, and see clouds occupied by cloud-people who make the weather. The Centipede makes the cloud-people angry, and they attack the peach. The friends manage to escape but are pursued all the way to the skies above New York City. When the last silk thread holding the peach to a seagull is severed, the peach plunges downward--only to be caught upon the spire of the Empire State Building. The people of New York, after a bit of initial trepidation, welcome James and his friends with open arms. There's a parade, and all the kids in New York eat the peach clean. All the bugs get good jobs in the city, and they put the stone in Central Park as a house for James to live, and kids visit him there all the time.</blockquote>\nSo, in a peach stone: the hero experiences tribulations but withstands them through some combination of luck, pluck, and quick thinking, in order to get to the end of the adventure at which point he or she is rewarded with his or her dearest dream. <br/><br/>You didn't hear me say monomyth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238293/#Comment_238293" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-20T05:57:30+00:00" title="October 20, 2009  5:57AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, <i>that's</i> what I want, Bill.<br/><br/>So here's what gets me with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and, from the sounds of it, James and the Giant Peach.

Charlie is a good boy. James is a good boy. At the end, they get what they deserve. The odious children who accompany Charlie into Wonka's factory are not good children; <i>they</i> get what <i>they</i> deserve, too. I'm reminded of the discussion in <i>The Dying Earth RPG</i> where the author discusses how Cugel's fortunes rise and fall depending on how much and how recently he has behaved like a scalawag.<br/><br/>So I could see a game that worked by confronting you with successive episodes of ill-luck or temptation to which your reaction amounted either to a demonstration of your pluck, quick thinking, and courtesy, or your limitations in those respects. Certain kinds of failure will move you farther away from getting what you want (because you no longer deserve it, if you ever did) while others, by forcing you to suffer the ennobling vicissitudes of fortune, get you closer.<br/><br/>So, the outcome of any instance of play could be to position the character as (a) fortunate and deserving, (b) unfortunate but deserving, (c) fortunate but undeserving, or (d) unfortunate and undeserving. So, for example, Charlie begins the game unfortunate (poor) but deserving (a good boy). He wants the golden ticket, and he gets one, which now makes him fortunate but undeserving (it's a zero-sum thing at this point). He passes through the chocolate factory and, faced with temptations, resists, making him deserving again. Now, both fortunate and deserving, he gets what he deserves: he is appointed successor to Wonka as head of the factory. <br/><br/>Now, since you want to avoid moral lessons, you can put some of that in the hands of the players, but that's a mechanical question.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238304/#Comment_238304" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-20T07:13:09+00:00" title="October 20, 2009  7:13AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Static characters exploring bizarre worlds.

It seems like these literary sources are often from a single point of view and that might matter to execution of the game.<br/><br/>Charlie has this rock-solid integrity as a personal foundation.  It's the thing that gets him through each of the challenges he faces and on to winning the big prize at the end.  I think it's reasonable to say that this attribute is a result of his poverty, so it's hard to extract the stuff you seem to like about it while leaving behind the moral lesson.

Maybe your game is about setting up an arc of linked, bizarre situations and describing how a single fundamental strength sees the character through.<br/><br/>When you say it's a children's game, you mean for children to play, right?

As in, in Dahl's work, it doesn't happen at all (because Dahl doesn't give a fuck about making adults feel comfy.)<br/><br/>An important theme is also coming out of an abusive environment into a loving family, and that family is not "normal" (it might be composed of giant insects) but it is more emotionally suitable than the abusive situation. James and the Giant Peach does this, so do several of the Narnia books, for certain definitions of "family."

Perhaps I can contribute some stuff.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>My favorite recent children's-wonderous-land story is Coraline. Coraline is dissatisfied with her boring life, has the opportunity to live an exciting life in a funhouse mirror-world, discovers that not all is as it seems there, escapes and then defeats evil, learns to appreciate what she had all along.</blockquote>\nCoraline has one of the scariest scenes in cinematic history. For reals.<br/><br/>It goes like this: Coraline finds a tiny door in her house, wanders through it and pops out in... her house. Except, the boy in the painting looks happier, the wallpaper is shinier, and everything is unpacked. Her house, but better.<br/><br/>She smells something, and wanders into the kitchen. There, she finds her mother cooking a roast chicken (but her mother never cooks! and it's night time!). Her mother wheels around, and reveals that it isn't in fact her mother... it's someone who looks like her mother, but has BUTTONS FOR EYES! (cue eerie music). She greats Coraline, and says dinner is almost ready.<br/><br/>When Coraline points out that her mother doesn't cook (or something like that), she giggles. "Oh, silly... I'm your <i>other</i> mother." That moment is haunting! The scene is a bit too good, combined with being a bit off... You're left wondering why you're so terrified.<br/><br/>It's the same as the ice queen offering Turkish Delight to the little boy in Narnia.<br/>That group of kids in the corner is only a little too pretty, and only a moderate amount of weird and insular.<br/><br/>This is how you build horror, fear, tension, unease or conflict in a children's story: you present a situation that is <b>a little bit wrong</b>, and you conceal the ramifications. The situation is<i> only a little bit wrong</i>, which then invites the children in... to see the shiny rewards being offered (take your pick: chocolate and wealth, turkish delight, a new life, a magical voyage, never-ending fun and whimsy). The shiny reward is always prefaced by a <b>tiny little promise</b> that the child has to make... And inevitably it's here that the child considers the ramifications of that thing which is a little bit wrong, or probes into its wrongness and sees that the "rabbit hole" goes pretty deep... and if the child refuses to promise or explores the wrongness too deeply, then we see the<b> true colours of the situation.</b><br/><br/>Coraline loves her other family!<br/>The button-eyes are a <i>touch </i>disconcerting, and everything's a <i>little </i>too good to believe... but she gets delicious meals and everything! Other Mother even made it so that Other Wyborn can't speak and is always smiling, and he's such better company that way!<br/><br/>Other Mr. B is a much better circus ringmaster than the real Mr. B, and the Other Actresses are much better actresses.<br/><br/>And then Other Mother offers to adopt Coraline forever. All she has to do is... sew buttons over her eyes. No biggie.<br/>And when Coraline freaks out, she starts noticing things... Other Dad is under the complete control of Other Mother. Other Wyborn doesn't have the choice of speaking... the Other Mice are actually rats!<br/><br/>Suddenly, she can't go home. Other Mother reveals her true form - a cackling, spindly witch. A great adventure is triggered! (and here the movie devolves a fair bit, into a mediocre "collect all of the power tokens" plot. W/e, it's still a rad movie.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238430/#Comment_238430" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-20T14:30:43+00:00" title="October 20, 2009  2:30PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a long post.

I wonder what they'd say about it? If it really isn't a good children's story (but it *is* appealing to the adult audience), why not?<br/><br/>Oh oh oh! Another recent child's-wonderous-land story popped into my head: Miyazaki's <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0876563/" rel="nofollow">Ponyo</a>, which showed up over here with English dubbing this year. Weird show, very little-kiddie in some ways and <i>WTF did I just see?</i> in others. In short, though, it's not the kid going to the wonderous land, it's the wonderous landing coming to the kid. Net result is that <i>everything</i> about the kid's normal life is upended 'til things are set right in the world. Escalating chaos due to supernatural shenanigans (the kid is kind of a victim of circumstance in a Grimm's Fairy Tales kind of way), which can only be set right by the hero proving himself to an all-powerful authority that he's a good person. <br/><br/>Hm.

This thread is really useful, so do me a favour? Keep focussed on themes and elements that occur in children's stories. Using particular stories as examples is good, but if it gets too much about one story, not so good.<br/><br/>Here are other things I wanted to say.<br/><br/>1. I like the obviousness of many children's stories. Who lives in clouds? Cloud-people. What do they do? They make the weather. <br/><br/>2. As a connected thing, the GM-figure in my game will ask lots of questions. They'll be prescripted. "What does he deserve?", "And who lives there?", "And what do you find?". If you can think of any questions linked to a particular theme, do tell me. For example, "But something is slightly wrong. What is it?" would neatly capture Joe's theme.<br/><br/>3.

Or perhaps it's only something that happens between siblings. But you have to watch out for encouraging comparisons between the children because they can get shirty about it. You also need to have a way of saying whose go it is and how that passes from player to player. One way of doing this might be to have only one die in the game.

Of course most of these weren't originally created for children; but they've always appealed to them and have been fine-tuned for that audience over the past 100 years or so. Bruno Bettelheim's classic book "The Uses Of Enchantment" is an exploration of the psychology of fairy tales and how children react to them. It's an excellent book, if you can overlook the outdated Freudian perspective.<br/><br/>You might want to look at the RPG "Grimm", which is all about dark/twisted fairy tales. It's definitely not for child <i>players</i> though; but some of the ideas might be inspiring.

That seems to be a common theme in a lot of children's stories, that the adults are oblivious to what's Really Going On, either because it involves magical things that only children can see, or because the Magical World is someplace that grownups can't go to, or because adults are so wrapped up in their mundane world that they are incapable of seeing the mysterious happenings right under their noses.  The protagonists who try to tell grown-ups about what's going on are invariably disbelieved and trivialized, or even accused of lying.  How unfair!

Most children's stories are veritable zoos.  The kids I know are constantly pretending to be different kinds of animals; it's one of the most common and universal kid activities.  Stories where every character is an animal, with personality traits based on species, are the default for younger children; stories for grown-ups, which have nobody but humans in them, must seem very monotonous and boring.  In stories for somewhat older children, there's either a society of one type of animal with other animals as their enemies (think Redwall... or Mouse Guard), or there's animals that can talk to humans, or humans get turned into animals by magic, or whatever.  Ever read, what was it, The Witches by Roald Dahl?  The main character gets turned into a mouse?  And <i>stays that way</i> at the end of the book?  When I was 9, that was like the coolest ending ever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238676/#Comment_238676" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-22T01:05:40+00:00" title="October 22, 2009  1:05AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Rabbit lead Alice to the place where she learned this:<br/><br/>Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br/>  Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br/>All mimsy were the borogoves,<br/>  And the mome raths outgrabe.<br/><br/>"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br/>  The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br/>Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br/>  The frumious Bandersnatch!"<br/><br/>He took his vorpal sword in hand:<br/>  Long time the manxome foe he sought --<br/>So rested he by the Tumtum tree,<br/>  And stood awhile in thought.<br/><br/>And, as in uffish thought he stood,<br/>  The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br/>Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br/>  And burbled as it came!<br/><br/>One, two!

The children listening or reading the book know that usually they won't be allowed to do anything exciting or dangerous, so something needs to make that possible.  And sometimes, the children are simply quicker/smarter/less bound up in their prejudices  than any of the adults (say, like in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fire-Stone-Leguin/dp/0689314086" rel="nofollow">Fire and Stone</a>, one of my kid's favorites when they were little).<br/><br/>(BTW, an interesting exception to the "clueless adult" trope is found in the works of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Eager" rel="nofollow">Edward Eager</a>, where the parents of kids in <i>Knight's Castle</i> and <i>The Time Garden</i> are the child protagonists of two earlier books, <i>Half Magic</i> and <i>Magic by the Lake</i>.)<br/><br/>Another way around the parent issue for at least books aimed at younger children are animal protagonists, either in proper animal form or in humanoid animal form.

It is something to do with power over destiny.  And grown ups don't mind if the mistakes are all made in the back story, but children do.  Apparently.<br/><br/>So I would ask opening questions that would lead children to make some mistakes, in game.  Perhaps characters might have a "Likes .... too much" trait.  "Tammy likes Cats too much."  "George likes Sports too much."  "Emily likes Singing too much."  Follow this up with, "does she get into trouble because of that? How?"  That kind of thing.  This idea of inviting trouble is a pretty significant feature of some of the Disney stories (like Sleeping Beauty).  It's a case of "I know I shouldn't be doing this, but I want to..." and then "Oops".<br/><br/>Getting back to themes in children's literature, many of the children's stories have themes of vengeance and spite (Snow White, Lion King, Matilda, Twits), and are about children, or childish characters, overcoming great perils with modesty.  Villainy is common.  In lots of Disney stories, the children are given an opportunity to face a terrible, unstoppable foe (who is after Grown-Up things), using their courage and imagination/special powers towards victory where all other Grown-Up solutions have failed.  The Grown-Ups feature, but often only as instruments of oppression (for one's own good), to underscore the children's true potency later on.<br/><br/>So, getting into trouble might be a pretty big deal, but nothing so great as the peril faced by the loveable characters of a magical world.  Coupling accountability with villainy, a very engaging story for children to play might be a story about mistakes that have affected a secret, magical world, and the ensuing adventure (to not only fix the problems they created, but to make things even better than they were in the first place).<br/><br/>Lastly, lots of children love gore.  It's arguably one of the great assets of the Roald Dahl collection.  Think of the Twits, the Revolting Rhymes, the BFG.  As long as it's not scary, and it's under their control, kids enjoy the gruesome stuff.  So, eh... Well, I don't know where I was going with that one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238810/#Comment_238810" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-22T17:33:01+00:00" title="October 22, 2009  5:33PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's neat.

For example,<br/><br/><i>All of a sudden there was a shrill scream from upstairs.  Tammy heard something plop down the stairs like a bunch of sausages.  Lying on the floor was the ugly, nasty old child minder with an angry growl on her face.  She must have drank the magic potion and her bones had shrivelled up!</i><br/><br/>That's not too scary, and could be amusing for a child.  Presented in a game of Cthulhu, with more torment and a less deserving victim, and this would make a much more terrifying scene.  I suppose it's down to attitude, characterisation, and the glossing over of the 'real' bits.  Nasty people who get hurt badly should still be nasty when they are suffering, not regretful nor helpless.<br/><br/>Also on the subject of gore, if you ask an imaginative little boy what he does with his sword to all the evil Prince's black knights, he'll probably say 'chop off all their heads,' and he'll want you to describe how scared the evil Prince becomes, not how awful the scene looks afterwards.  So, I reckon it's all about the kids being in charge.  That's what they want.  And I wouldn't worry about <i>putting </i>gore in the game.  The gruesome kids will probably add their own gore for you, soon enough.<br/><br/>P.S.
