I've already picked out my scenario to run, but another one has my eye, as well.  It's a splatter-riffic combination of slasher-horror and the sort of thing from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0844479/" rel="nofollow">The Collector</a> called <i>Vorkuta Block 9</i>.<br/><br/>I have <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=13358" rel="nofollow">other questions</a> about "Vorkuta Block 9," but something about the way the scenario is meant to be roleplayed caught my eye and became a topic of discussion on <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11452" rel="nofollow"><a href="/forums/search?Search=%23playnow&amp;Mode=like">#playnow</a></a>.  In the text it says:\n<blockquote>The scenario starts with establishing scenes with a few of the residents, and you should go to some pains to make them unsympathetic.</blockquote>\nThis is something I haven't encountered before: an encouragement to play characters in such a way that they're actively unlikable.  Which isn't to say that I haven't played unsympathetic characters (I have), but it's never been the suggested <i>norm</i>.<br/><br/>I suppose the idea in "Vorkuta Block 9" is that unsympathetic characters make better fodder for the killer in the scenario.  But aside from the specific example, I wonder how many players would want to take on a role like that.  Can you see yourself playing not to make a character heroic in even the small ways ordinary folks can be heroic, instead turning them into antiheroes at best, unlikable trolls at worst?  Would you derive pleasure from doing so?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301125/#Comment_301125" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-17T07:50:34+00:00" title="November 17, 2010  7:50AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Definitely.

Captain Astounding was a self-centered dick, authoritarian and full of dogma and petty plots.  Sure, it gave some people cause to gang up on him, but it drove a believable story.  I don't think, at that table, people were really falling into their character up until the point where we saw how depraved or socially dangerous some of the other characters were.<br/><br/>And this goes doubly for The Mountain Witch.  Some of the best performances I have seen have been from very unsympathetic characters.  Verbally and physically abusive, openly manipulative, among other things.<br/><br/>I may be biased by past pay-offs, but it seems to me these unsympathetic characters usually expose their vulnerabilities in one critical moment of failure.  If we don't find sympathy in the characters downfall, we can find catharsis in their punishment.  It's hard to feel either with a luke-warm character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301149/#Comment_301149" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-17T10:32:48+00:00" title="November 17, 2010 10:32AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Almost all my characters are assholes, virtually every NPC would agree, and most of the PCs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301151/#Comment_301151" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-17T11:11:14+00:00" title="November 17, 2010 11:11AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I rarely play assholes--I game to escape my normal life. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

In Sarah Lynne Bowman's <i><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Pn3wR74wDCgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=sarah+lynne+bowman+functions+of+role-playing+games&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VmaWxCmdYR&amp;sig=Iy4-HXqtIBMxaTYwqmKH45Fdh2A&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rIvpTODMAsKblgf14Py2Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">Functions of Role-Playing Games</a></i>, this sort of thing is called playing an "oppositional self" (or perhaps "taboo self") to reflect its distance from the "real person" playing the game. In any event, it seems that toying with a character's "likeability" is an interesting technique that can contribute to how satisfying a game is. I'm reminded once more of the thread on the Forge where Ron Edwards talks about playing KPFS and reflecting upon the weird disjunction it creates: you play this pathetic loser to whom you are unsympathetic, and yet the act of playing him means that the identification you feel towards your character undercuts that antipathy. I wish I could find that thread; it's really interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301667/#Comment_301667" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-21T16:53:04+00:00" title="November 21, 2010  4:53PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill, yeah, makes sense to me.

I agree. The literary philosopher Mikhail Bakhtin talks about the relationship between author and character as being shaped by this tension between the author's responsibility for <i>creating</i> the character, and for <i>passing judgment</i> on him or her. On the one hand, the character is an <i>extension</i> of the author; on the other, the character is <i>alienated from</i> the author. I think there's something similar going on in role-playing games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301679/#Comment_301679" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-21T19:24:22+00:00" title="November 21, 2010  7:24PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playing evil and/or nasty and/or unsympathetic characters has always been hard for me.  Not as huge a problem when playing, necessarily, so long as the game is designed to be somewhat heroic.  Very problematic in GMing!  I often say that I discovered my Narrativist bent when running 3.0 back in college (campaign ran for five semesters, from September '01 to December '03).  I accidentally and without meaning to often made the various factions in the world all somewhat reasonable and sympathetic.  Though, to my credit, the PCs *hated* the main villain, especially the 3 out of the 6 players who'd been in since the beginning.<br/><br/>But most indie games support this "shades of gray" GMing style much better.<br/><br/>That said, I've gotten much, much better at playing unsympathetic assholes, especially when GMing but sometimes when playing (like in 3:16), in the last couple of years.  It's an important skill to have if you want to provoke your players to violence.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301687/#Comment_301687" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-21T22:21:16+00:00" title="November 21, 2010 10:21PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find myself often doing something related, if not exactly what's being talked about here.
