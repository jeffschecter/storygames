There's no reason you can't.  If you're that sorry of a person that even as an undead, you're only thoughts are of suicide.  Then go for it.  Walk out into the sun, work out self decapitation, toss yourself onto a picket fence.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ultimate reason people don't kill themself is self preservation.  Just being a vampire, chances are people will look for other answers first.  Satiate the thirst through other means, if not, you're undead/immortal anyways, as far as I know they only grow weak, and do not die from hunger.  Live as a recluse.   Maybe become a vigilante, feed only off criminals and tell yourself you're doing the right thing.  etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/No%20Love%20Orchestra" title="No Love Orchestra"><img alt="No Love Orchestra" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/No%20Love%20Orchestra">No Love Orchestra</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226429/#Comment_226429" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-21T02:20:45+00:00" title="August 21, 2009  2:20AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You cannot die.

(a more detailed exploration of ideas already presented by others) If you want to keep the angst angle in, then make vampires indestructible and change the question from "will you drink" to "who will you drink from?"<br><br>If vampires are indestructible, then there's no way to escape. Why? It's a curse, and whoever (be it a divine being, a demon, or whatever) placed the curse to create vampires doesn't want to allow them that easy way out. If something truly destructive occurs to the vampire, the vampire re-forms the next night.<br/><br/>Next, the hungry vampire must feed (human only, animal blood doesn't cut it). Either the character picks someone to feed off of, or loses control and the gamemaster picks someone that happens to be handy and you explore the tragic results of that. There are lots of plot twists that the gamemaster can put into that mix, exploring justification, loss.<br/><br/>2. Still got something to do that you didn't finish in life? Drinking empowers that desire. Want to love or care? You've got to drink to feel it. Want to hate? Drink. This is a little like the hungry ghosts (gaki) of Japanese myth. This also forces drinking from humans, as drinking the blood becomes symbolic of drinking that humanity/human emotion.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226431/#Comment_226431" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-21T03:03:52+00:00" title="August 21, 2009  3:03AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd twitch Graham's requirements slightly..

In our world? This might seem contrary to genre expectations, but I'd pretty much give myself up to a trustworthy public organ of some sort - the Finnish government would be pretty good, they probably wouldn't do anything stupid with the vampire virus (or whatever I'd believe to be the cause of my condition) without asking the UN first. The advantages would be pretty good: such an organization would have no trouble feeding me, they'd have humanitarian reasons for keeping me alive, they could restrain the beast from hurting anybody, and research into my condition could help the public good in several ways, including indentifying and hunting down less altruistic vampires if it came to that.<br/><br/>So yeah, my answer is that I'm not killing myself because I can be of greater use to the world alive. If that weren't the case for some reason I'd probably end up killing myself, unless I could figure out some sort of backdoor out of the predatory vampiristic situation. It's notable that most vampire roleplaying games sweeten the basic deal quite a bit to make it palatable at all: you don't have to kill anybody ever, you get superpowers and so on. I imagine that this is all necessary exactly because otherwise the whole situation is predicated on your character being a weak-willed pussy unable to off himself when it starts to make sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226436/#Comment_226436" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-21T03:38:08+00:00" title="August 21, 2009  3:38AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome stuff, everybody. Here's a conglomerate idea. Win or fail?<br/><br/>Once you're a vampire, the Beast is in you. The Beast doesn't want to die and if you try to kill yourself, it's going to stop you. Maybe at one time, you'll be able to conquer it. But to do that, you need to be strong. and to be strong, you need to feed.<br/><br/>What's more, blood is the innermost aspect of what we are. By taking another creature's blood into your veins, you take some part of that creature into yourself, as well. You become it and it becomes you. Feed on animals and you become an animal.

The idea of an alien entity taking control of your body and mind is truly horrifying. Compared to that, normal vampirism is starting to look like a lifestyle choice. After all, in most Vampire games I've played the characters were able to confront the supernatural scares with their will, identity and self-control pretty much intact. Sure, eventually you'll get hungry and overcoming crappy rolls eats up your Willpower, but most of the time the choice to feed on someone is an authentic one. The real horror happens when you are denied of that choice but left to deal with the personal consequences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226439/#Comment_226439" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-21T04:59:23+00:00" title="August 21, 2009  4:59AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 21, 2009 5:01AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            * You won't kill yourself because you are, in the final analysis, a faithless, gutless coward.  If you weren't a faithless, gutless coward, they wouldn't have been able to turn you into a vampire in the first place -- you would have died with your soul intact before the curse took hold.  You may spend the rest of eternity trying to build up the courage to do yourself in, but probably you won't.<br/><br/>* You won't kill yourself because becoming a vampire makes you no longer human, and therefore no longer a nice guy who wasn't brought up to kill people just to survive; upon becoming a vampire, you think like a vampire, thoroughly and completely.  You are literally incapable of seeing human beings as anything other than prey, and while they might be fooled by your nearly-flawless imitation of humanity, you're only doing it so they don't scream and run before you can get your fangs into 'em.  What's "angst," anyway?  Oh, right, that's when you imitate their monkey sounds of grief and flop around on the couch reciting lines like "I hate this monster I've become!" and "I refuse to give in to the amoral ravening beast inside me!" until tonight's dinner calms down and turns its back long enough for you to jump it.<br/><br/>* You won't kill yourself because if you die, you will definitely go to Hell.  Living forever as a monster is better than Hell.  Anything is better than Hell.  And who knows, maybe they'll find a cure?<br/><br/>* You won't kill yourself because despite your initial horror at what you must do to survive, it turns out that you're actually pretty good at it.  No, you're <i>damn</i> good at it.  And the craziest part is, it's making you better at everything.  The less you care about your victims, the more people love you.  Your decisions are better, your senses sharper, your speech more fluent...you're even getting more attractive.  Every time you feed without remorse, your existence improves in real, tangible, immediately obvious ways.<br/><br/>* You won't kill yourself because the water supply is laced with a drug that inhibits suicidal thoughts...which is the only reason that most of humanity hasn't killed themselves in this impoverished, dystopian future.  Since all your victims are dosed to the eyeballs on this stuff, you are too; unless you starve yourself for months to get the drug out of your system (good luck with that), it will never even occur to you that you <i>could</i> kill yourself.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>The funny thing for me is that this is the kind of thing VtM was about but IME it quickly turns into a power trip and the angst is then more about whether other vampires will kill you from feeding from their patch.</blockquote>\nWell, that was <i>one</i> of the things that VtM was about, but only if you wanted it to be.  If you tried to shoehorn in everything that the rulebook talked about into a single game, you'd go crazy from the strain, and also it likely wouldn't turn out that great.  The best games of any WoD system I ever played in all had one thing in common: we chose just a few things to emphasize in the setting, and let the rest slide.  The angsty woe-is-me Vampire game about the loss of humanity worked just as well as the heavy-politics our-coterie-will-rule-this-city game, because in the former we didn't sweat the political stuff and in the latter we ignored the angst.<br/><br/>I always thought of this as one of the game's great strengths: by deciding what to leave in and what to sweep under the rug, you could get exactly the Vampire game you wanted to play, quickly and easily.  The downside was that you did have to think about what Vampire game you wanted to play before you created characters and started playing, but...you know, that's not really a downside, considering that most games work better when you do that anyway.  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226440/#Comment_226440" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-21T05:00:22+00:00" title="August 21, 2009  5:00AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some ancient superstitions said a vamp could only be killed by staking it to the ground, cutting off its head, stuffing the mouth full of garlic, burning the body, spreading the ashes on sacred ground, etc, etc, etc.<br/><br/>Kinda hard to do to yourself by yourself.<br/><br/>After the third time of walking out into the sun, bursting into flames, and then rising from the ashes in some gutter that evening, you'd decide you needed a little more research to get the job done.<br/><br/>A potentially cool storyline would be a vamp seeking to enlist help in ending his/her life.

It's not a trivializing statement, though, because there are still real life parallels. One classic is the wounded person in a survival situation who tells their fellows to go on ahead - and this is often romanticized and celebrated. Another example is killing yourself to uphold honor. At the end of the Battle of Stalingrad, a great many German officers committed suicide because that was a socially and culturally supported thing to do. Friedrich Paulus was promoted to Field Marshal exactly because every previous commander of that rank had opted for suicide rather than capture - but Paulus by that time had become so disillusioned with his government that he refused.<br><br>Being suicidal is not what this is about. It's about the social obligation to do some kind of good, utilitarian or otherwise, by killing yourself. Soldiers do it when they jump on grenades. Captains do it when they go down with the ship. And people who are becoming literal monsters <i>could</i> do it to spare their friends and neighbors. That they do not is inherently tied into something bigger - just as Friedrich Paulus being mysteriously alive at the end of the Battle of Stalingrad. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Because I justify it to myself as not my fault. This was done TO me, not BY me.</blockquote>\nPretty likely. Note the perverse effect of the Curse of Vampirism on morality: if the curse forces you to attack innocents, then you can just be a tragic good guy the rest of the time, trying to atone or make things right. If the curse doesn't turn you into a mad dog, then 'being a vampire' in any kind of way that is verifiable or actually matters (where did all that blood go?) means you're just a jerk.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226550/#Comment_226550" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-21T12:24:29+00:00" title="August 21, 2009 12:24PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">oo!

They don't breathe or get sick, so they can work in environments where it would be difficult for ordinary humans to get anything done.  Vampire scientists are on the cutting edge of medical research, finding cures for infectious diseases.  Vampires are also incredible diagnosticians: like dogs, they can <i>smell</i> cancer inside a person.  A vampire can taste a blood sample and immediately tell you everything you need to know.  Vampires solve crimes, dig tunnels, maintain underwater pipelines and telephone conduits.  Overall, vampires save more lives than they take -- and this is apparently a price that society is willing to pay, especially considering all the economic benefits of having vampires around.  And eventually the whole artificial blood substitute project might work out, allowing vampires to exist without killing anyone at all.<br><br/>* You won't kill yourself because it would hurt your friends and your family.  It doesn't matter to them what you've become; they love and support you and want only the best for you.  And so it doesn't matter if you are constantly miserable and in the depths of despair, you will grit your fangs and keep going, because as awful as your "life" is, your suicide would cause them pain.<br/><br/>* You won't kill yourself because you called the suicide hotline and got information about a Vampire Support Group meeting in your area.  Sitting in a shitty YMCA meeting room talking through your problems with other foul creatures of the night may not be the sexiest way to deal with your existential horror, but it's surprisingly effective.  Plus, you started a bowling league with some other self-help groups; this Thursday night, the Blood Brothers will square off against the Born Losers (Gambler's Anonymous) in the semi-finals!                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226556/#Comment_226556" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-21T12:41:56+00:00" title="August 21, 2009 12:41PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>* You won't kill yourself because you called the suicide hotline and got information about a Vampire Support Group meeting in your area.

Pretty much all of our philosophy and religion comes down to struggling to find an answer, one way or another, to the problem of how to live with ourselves as killers. In hunter-gatherer societies for the first 99% of human existence, we mostly tried to balance the scales. We take the lives of those who offer those lives to us, in exchange for our oath to one day give our own lives in turn, and in the meantime, do what we can to make the land we live in a better place. With the Agricultural Revolution, you got some different answers, like "we're superior because we have souls/self-awareness/intellect". While I think you've hit upon the theme rather exactly, Grant, I wouldn't say just meat-eaters. You could leave it at just "eaters." Vegetarianism doesn't exempt you from the basic animal need to kill something to continue your own life. Vegetarianism uses that same line of argument: "it's OK, I just kill plants, and they're a lower order of being" or "they don't have souls/self-awareness/intellect/feel pain". Of course, we now know that plants have serial or parallel nervous systems capable of as much complexity as animal brains, they have stress hormones just like animals do, so our ancient intuitions that plants and animals have as much personhood and ability to suffer and self-awareness as us (or at least, some of them do), seems to have more and more biological evidence backing it up, so we have as much reason to consider an animal's or a plant's ability to feel pain as another human being's. Other good reasons remain for vegetarianism, but you have no "easy out" on the basic crisis of animal life. You still have to kill something to live, so you've got to find one way or another to make your peace with yourself as a killer.<br/><br/>Vampire stories reflect that back to us by turning the tables on us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

Pretty much all of our philosophy and religion comes down to struggling to find an answer, one way or another, to the problem of how to live with ourselves as killers. In hunter-gatherer societies for the first 99% of human existence, we mostly tried to balance the scales. We take the lives of those who offer those lives to us, in exchange for our oath to one day give our own lives in turn, and in the meantime, do what we can to make the land we live in a better place. With the Agricultural Revolution, you got some different answers, like "we're superior because we have souls/self-awareness/intellect". While I think you've hit upon the theme rather exactly, Grant, I wouldn't say just meat-eaters. You could leave it at just "eaters." Vegetarianism doesn't exempt you from the basic animal need to kill something to continue your own life. Vegetarianism uses that same line of argument: "it's OK, I just kill plants, and they're a lower order of being" or "they don't have souls/self-awareness/intellect/feel pain". Of course, we now know that plants have serial or parallel nervous systems capable of as much complexity as animal brains, they have stress hormones just like animals do, so our ancient intuitions that plants and animals have as much personhood and ability to suffer and self-awareness as us (or at least, some of them do), seems to have more and more biological evidence backing it up, so we have as much reason to consider an animal's or a plant's ability to feel pain as another human being's. Other good reasons remain for vegetarianism, but you have no "easy out" on the basic crisis of animal life. You still have to kill something to live, so you've got to find one way or another to make your peace with yourself as a killer.<br/>\n<br/>\nVampire stories reflect that back to us by turning the tables on us.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nThis is probably one of the smartest posts I've read in a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226857/#Comment_226857" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-23T00:19:08+00:00" title="August 23, 2009 12:19AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2009 12:23AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does every child molester who regrets his actions, but finds that they cannot stop themselves, kill themselves? We could only wish. Why is it that we need some external rationale for why a human would act in their own interest and not morally, even if it pained them to do not to kill themselves? I'm not saying it never happens. But with life and death? I'd say that it's by far the exception that people do the right thing. Camus, in the Myth of Sisyphus, talks about how it is a completely backass idea that existentialism would indicate suicide as a rational option, when all living things rush to continue life with most of their effort every day. <br>\n<br>\nIn fact, if you make it the "beast" that prevents suicide, then you take away this incredibly dramatic potential act from the player. Do not allow the player to blame his characters acts on some external force. Make it the character's fault. <br>\n<br>\nNow, a player has to feel a reason not to commit suicide. As they are not the character, and do not feel the character's survival drive. So, to extend on what Jared is saying, you have to make the player feel that survival drive mechanically. How? That's up to you. <br>\n<br/>\nOh, and this might sound oddly sexist, but only males ever do it (suicide solely for the benefit of others). Women only very rarely do, unless you consider taking a hit for their children to be suicide. Why? Because their survival instinct is stronger than the male instinct. Because, reproductively, males are disposable. Females are not. 1 Male+100 females = tribe survives. 1 Female+100 Males = Tribe dies. Hence why you send the males to hunt for protein... it doesn't matter a lot if occasionally one doesn't come back. <br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone is watching Being Human on the BBC right now, right? Right? They had a behind the scenes with the vampire character's actor, and he pointed out how it's a metaphor for addiction. Yes, you have this very real drive that's not your fault. But you can resist it, if you have the will to do so. If you fail to do so, and somebody dies as a consequence, then are you morally culpable? Does it matter if somebody tells you it's not your fault? Aren't you going to be tormented anyhow? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226911/#Comment_226911" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-23T10:58:35+00:00" title="August 23, 2009 10:58AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2009 11:03AM by Burr.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm just a scavenger.
