Hope you enjoy it!<br/><br/><b>THE RAIN</b><br/>- a roleplaying poem by Tomas HV M\xf8rkrid<br/><br/>You may be 6-13 players of this RP-poem.<br/>You need chairs (or floorspace) in front of a window (every player must have a view of the outside).<br/>The weather must be rainy (a heavy torrent is best).<br/><br/>Sit down before the window. Sit as close as possible.<br/>Each and every player should be within easy reach of the hands of several co-players.<br/>One of you read these instructions for all.<br/>When at the end of the instructions, you commence play without delay.<br/>One of you must take the time while playing, and stop the gameplay at 15 minutes.<br/><br/><b>- The phases and the game</b><br/>During the two phases of the game; talk and silence, you will go through life, experiencing love and breakups as if the whole game lasted a lifetime. And when the game ends, you will narrate your own death.<br/><br/><b>- The talk phase</b><br/>You may talk normally on any topic you deem interesting. Try to engage in calm dialog with the others.<br/>Whenever anyone takes your hand, you are in love with that person, and the two of you are spouses/sweethearts.<br/>If you hold hands with two men/women, you have a lover on the side (the last to take your hand).<br/><br/><b>- The silence phase</b><br/>When anyone say these words: <b>It is raining outside</b>, you will all be quiet for a little while, staring at the rain.<br/>You may let go of the hand of your spouse/sweetheart/lover during the silence, and thus breaking up with him/her.<br/><br/>Go through the two phases again and again, until the timekeeper announce the end.<br/><br/><b>- The end</b><br/>When the timekeeper announces that the time is up, you will stand up one by one, and describe how you die. Make sure to tell your co-players if you dies as a happy or miserable soul. Do not embellish. Make it short, and sit down to listen to the deaths of the others.<br/><br/>When all have told how they died, the game is over.<br/><br/>Take care and have fun!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160445/#Comment_160445" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-03T08:45:13+00:00" title="August  3, 2008  8:45AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 3, 2008 8:46AM by Matthijs.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This looks wonderful.

And reading it brought up a question about social mores.<br/><br/>Is it more "normal" or "acceptable" (not really saying this right) for (Northern) Europeans to hold each others hands outside of a romantic relationship?  Even in the hippie-dippy SF Bay Area, most people will flinch or hesitate when asked to hold onto someone's hand if they aren't close family or lovers.  Unless it's a situation like helping someone or comforting someone who is in pain or sad.<br/><br/>So for instance, if I suggested at an open gaming table that everyone hold hands, I'd get a lot of uneasy looks and hesitation and probably joking comments.  It's seen as pretty intimate here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_160661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160661/#Comment_160661" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-04T14:18:23+00:00" title="August  4, 2008  2:18PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Chris!<br/><br/>Holding hands is seen as kind of intimate here too, apart for the everyday handshake, of course. That is the reason I use it in this game. The fact is that we react to touch, and even the mild reaction created by the hand-holding may be used to unlock some deeper levels in us while playing this game.<br/><br/>A for the looks and hesitation and joking comments: it all depends on two things:<br/><br/>1 - the players: who are they? How mature are they? Do they have it in them to play a game of serious make-believe?<br/><br/>2 - your way of presenting the element: do it with confidence and a calm voice! Make no fuzz about it, and it will most likely be a natural part of the game.<br/><br/>Good luck!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_164652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164652/#Comment_164652" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-23T16:58:39+00:00" title="August 23, 2008  4:58PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I have to try this game out now!
