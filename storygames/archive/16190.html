But it also highlights for me how important it is for backers to understand what being a backer means.  (these thoughts are edited up from some conversations I've had about this project that I thought might be relevant to a Kickstarter resources thread)<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Kickstarter is not a store. Its not ebay. Its not Amazon. Its a place where average people can participate in the patronage model of artistic creation that has produced most of the world's art throughout history, but that was previously limited to the rich.  If you're going to back a kickstarter project don't treat it like just another online site to buy stuff. Its a whole different model, its a whole different experience, it SHOULD be a whole different set of expectations.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink of all the straight up purchases you've ever made in your life.  How many of those had issues:  double billed credit cards, items that were broken or the wrong size when they arrived, shipping that was delayed or lost entirely, whatever.  Those issues happen even on a transaction as simple and straight forward as buying something...transactions that happen millions of times a day and thus have been perfected as much as humanly practical and they STILL have issues.  Now realize that a kickstarter project is going to be ALOT messier, a lot less straight forward than that.  Many people will be doing this for the first (or second or third time) and will learning as they go.  Expect a much higher frequency of bumps in the road...or don't be a backer.<br/>\n<br/>\nGranted the poor guy in this project blundered pretty badly but, from some of the comments of the outraged and entitled you'd think he was Barry Madoff ripping people off billions.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if this case turns out to be actual fraud, that's another story. But right now it reads to me more like an overly ambitious project, being unprepared for overshooting his goal by a large margin, lack of communication, and some rookie mistakes in setting up for production.  All of which are excellent lessons for future project Kickstarters...but ALSO for future Kickstarter backers.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile there are quite a few actual professionals taking advantage of access to crowd funding, in it's most raw form...Kickstarter is about passionate artists getting up the courage to try something they've never tried before and never imagined might actually be possible. I think backers ought to go into backing any project with the mindset that some will fly and some will fall and that's part of the journey of being a patron.  You're not signing up just to get cool rewards.  You're also joining together to support the journey of an artist in pursuit of their dream.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nHopefully resources like this thread (and various books that have come out) will help reduce the incidence of such disasters.  But I think there are also valuable lessons to be learned for backers...and I don't mean of the Caveat Emptor kind...I mean of the embrace the chaos and see the experience of helping someone struggle with their dream as the core reason you're a backer in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI worry that with the discovery of Kickstarter by professionals (like the $1mm+ programming projects) that are attracting a new wave of Kickstarter support, that backers will start having inflated standards and forget that the origin of internet crowd sourcing (which distinguishes it from Renaissance flavored patronage) is to provide patronage for the amateurs who very well may not be as polished in their execution.  I wonder what steps Kickstarter is taking to help with that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369092/#Comment_369092" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-24T11:22:02+00:00" title="March 24, 2012 11:22AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 24, 2012 11:25AM by Mcdaldno.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph,<br><br>While your thoughts are good thoughts, I <i>do</i> believe that it's okay to treat Kickstarter like just another purchase, with a few caveats (there's risk, there's a waiting period, there are explicit product tiers).<br><br>For example, I bought some chapbooks from the <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/seattle-and-back-or-bust" rel="nofollow">Trench Mouth Medicine Show</a>. They were selling poetry merch in order to raise money for a trip. I didn't care about their trip at all. I just cared about the loot. I paid them money (accepting risk and delay), and they sent me awesome merch. It was very much a simple, straight-up purchase. Their write-up included the line "<i>don't think of this as a "donation" or a "loan" -- think of it as a way to buy books or get some custom writing/artwork.</i>"<br><br>Similarly, I backed <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/232860137/modest-medusa-season-1" rel="nofollow">Modest Medusa</a> after it'd been fully funded. I wanted the book, so I paid $22 for the book. It was very much a simple, straight-up purchase. However, along the way, I had to accept risk and delay. It ended up being several months late, which was all "part of what I signed on for."<br><br>I think it's fine to treat a Kickstarter like "just a regular purchase" <b>IF</b>: you also accept that there is risk and delay involved, the creator is in turn treating it like "just a regular sale," you have flexible expectations, you don't back a project in order to get a birthday present for someone*.<br><br>(*Seriously don't do this. It's a bad idea. There are so many variations, and so often there are delays.

I don't think its irreconcilable with what I just said about treating a project like a simple sale... but I do think that responsible backing involves figuring out how those two ideas work together.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369094/#Comment_369094" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-24T11:54:11+00:00" title="March 24, 2012 11:54AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 24, 2012 11:55AM by Valamir.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think they would have gotten away with that on Kickstarter.

Seems paper-thin to me, a true fig-leaf argument if there's any. Sales are sales, even if you're having people communicate what they're buying by how much money they'll pay to you. Most of these Kickstarter projects would be hard-pressed to demonstrate that they did not lead people to expect reimbursement in the form of goods that were being offered. I'd be interested if anybody thinks that they have an informed opinion on this.<br><br>I mean, I haven't studied this scene that much, so I don't know - do the use terms of e.g. Kickstarter specifically try to disallow a commercial relationship between the people who sell and the people who buy there? Should be interesting if somebody took that at face value and argued that they are not, in fact, obligated to provide anybody with the goods and services they paid for via Kickstarter because those monies were not in payment, but just voluntary donations. Were I one of the customers, I'd stand on my rights in the matter - these merchants clearly communicate to me that they will be providing me with services and goods in proportion to my payment. It's the merchant who's dodging sales taxes if they choose to one-sidedly interpret the relationship as a weird mutual donation instead of e.g. book preorder.<br><br>I didn't read Joe's article on the topic yet, so if he answers this question there, all the better. And of course, the above doubts obviously concern only the types of crowdfunded projects that are clearly commercial in the way we usually understand the term. There are many Kickstarter projects where one could, indeed, feasibly argue that they do not involve the sale of goods or services. Any project where the fruits are released for free in digital format, for example, although you could again offer "donation incentives" (goods and services, that is) even if the main product is going to be a free and public good.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369109/#Comment_369109" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-24T17:50:22+00:00" title="March 24, 2012  5:50PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite><br>I mean, I haven't studied this scene that much, so I don't know - do the use terms of e.g. Kickstarter specifically try to disallow a commercial relationship between the people who sell and the people who buy there?</br></blockquote>\nThe language of both Kickstarter and IndieGoGo both carefully avoid talk of "buying" and "products" and "sales."<br><br>Similarly, lots of of conventions are structured as "nonprofit organizations" where people buy "membership shares" for an annual event, as a method of tax evasion.

I do like that KS has a separate "small projects" section, which is nice. I think on the one hand, seeing really slick videos and such can motivate a creator to up their game for their own pitch. Also, folks who are already embedded in a network don't necessarily need to sell so hard, big and small (like, i wonder how many people funded Wasteland 2 without reading anything on the page?)<br/><br/>That said, I love finding weird, unpolished projects that I would have never thought of.

Having work-in-progress Kickstarters doesn't feel like a "deflated standard" to me.<br/><br/>What I do want to see, though, is a timeline for completion, and a creator who's willing to engage the audience with updates and discussion until that project is complete. The more unfinished a project is at the point of funding, the more engagement I want to see.<br/><br/>DoubleFine's model here is pretty cool - they didn't want to commit months of studio development time to the project before they knew if it was financially viable to do so, but they recognized that a full game dev would take many months. Their solution was to include a development forum and a documentary series in the project, so that people were also paying for the opportunity to go into the belly of the beast.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frank%20T" title="Frank T"><img alt="Frank T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Frank%20T">Frank T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369196/#Comment_369196" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-26T06:14:06+00:00" title="March 26, 2012  6:14AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 26, 2012 6:35AM by Frank T.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I cannot speak for the US but in Germany, the relevant question for taxation is whether you operate a business, in particular, whether you intend to make a profit on what you do, or not.

I thought, "Perfect Unrevised has been in development for four years, and has been played by hundreds of people. I could probably sell through a small traditional print run (1000 copies)." I launched a Kickstarter to raise money and demand for that 1000-copy print run, and fell quite a bit short of the mark. To date, I've only sold about 150 physical copies of the game.<br/><br/>I thought, "Monsterhearts is a pretty attractive game, and is building on Apocalypse World's buzz. I should probably order <i>at least</i> two hundred copies initially, maybe even 300." I sold over 400 physical copies during IndieGoGo pre-orders alone. Given those numbers, it was way cheaper to do a traditional print run of 1000 copies than to rely on POD printers.<br/><br/>I'm not good at gauging interest. Kickstarter/IndieGoGo allow me to do that. I use those platforms at the "ransom" stage, but not for their ransom capability - rather, in order to save myself from having a garage full of games that won't sell.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369255/#Comment_369255" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-26T12:02:20+00:00" title="March 26, 2012 12:02PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Frank T</cite>By the way, is "Playing Sorcerer" out yet? ;-)</blockquote>\nSince it got back-of-the-bus'd for <b>The Booth At The End</b>, I can live with the delay. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369422/#Comment_369422" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-27T12:43:40+00:00" title="March 27, 2012 12:43PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite>I'm not good at gauging interest.

Why pick favorites? Why agonize over various pitches when you can just help them all? And, from the designer's point of view, what's the point in having a sole patron when you can have hundreds with less risk? In terms of effort, one grant vs. donating to 100+ kickstarters, it's about the same. Basically, compared to a grant, spending $1000 on Kickstarter is better for me, better for designers, everyone wins. <br/><br/>I recently <a href="http://divnull.com/blog/2012/kickstarter-analysis/" rel="nofollow">analyzed my Kickstarter contributions</a> up through 2011. I certainly spent quite a bit more than I would have on grants. On the other hand, it got me involved in two orders of magnitude more products.

My investment in any given project tends to be low (usually, I back at the "electronic-only" level for most projects, as I don't have enough bookshelf space as it is), so there is a bit of a "junk bond" feel to the whole endeavor. That is, when investing in junk bonds, the idea is that you shotgun money into a bunch of them, knowing that most will disappoint, but the payoff when one strikes it rich still makes it profitable in aggregate. Naturally, this isn't what actually happens with kickstarters, but I kind of approach it that way anyway. <br><br>Essentially, I start from the standpoint of viewing the money as being disposable, which removes a lot of the stress and worry (or even contemplation) about many of the things you are asking about. (From a practical standpoint, pledging to a kickstarter involves huge piles of <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/counterpartyrisk.asp" rel="nofollow">counterparty risk</a>, so if you are investing money you can't live without losing, you are a fool.)<br><br>Generally speaking, I would favor less communication than what I get now. I'm typically backing about a dozen projects at any given time. As a consequence, I tend to get three to six update e-mails each day. The vast majority of these updates are completely useless to me. Unfortunately, I have to read them, because the few that really do matter are <i>crucial</i> (e.g. "here is the link and password to download the finished product").<br><br>I don't care about project outlines at all.<br/><br/>Creator credentials only come into play in the following way: if I dig the creator's previous work, I'm more likely to back at a higher level.<br/><br/>I maintained a strict "no interference" policy when doing the gaming grants. I see no reason to change that with Kickstarters. In the cases where a project reward offers the backer a chance to specify something in the project (e.g. "a major NPC will be named after you"), I can't remember a case where I actually followed up and specified something for use. Basically, I look at the thing as "I'm giving you money to produce your vision", not "I want someone else to produce my vision and will pay them to do so".<br/><br/>My recent analysis illustrated to me that I don't care as much about timeliness as I thought I did. And I didn't think I cared that much about it to begin with. Only real rule here is "if party X hasn't delivered yet, don't invest in a new project by party X until they do". It'll get done eventually. Like I said, in most cases, I'm not investing much per project. The time and effort it would take to strictly monitor a project and get bent out of shape if it looks like they are stiffing the backers will cost me vastly more than the money I'd lose from the investment. (It's like: Google has a massive server farm. Inevitably, machines in this farm die. What does Google do when this happens? Nothing. Because the cost of vigilantly monitoring and repairing dying machines is greater than just buying a new server rack to replace machines assumed to be dead.)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369595/#Comment_369595" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-28T00:33:58+00:00" title="March 28, 2012 12:33AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

If you read the kinds of articles that you guys are posting,  the pitfalls are clearly outlined, and I know that was a big help to me when Magpie Games was putting together <i><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/marktruman/the-plays-the-thing-a-shakespearean-rpg" rel="nofollow">The Play's The Thing</a></i>. It was great to be able to stand on the shoulders of giants (Daniel Solis!).<br><br>Having been through the process once, I really Mcdaldno that one of the primary purposes of KS should be to gauge the market interest for a product. We thought that TPTT was going to be a fun product, but it got a much bigger response than we ever expected. I poured a lot more time and energy into the game than I initially planned on because we gathered such a large community of support (relative to our expectations).  <br/><br/>I don't think this is just "risk-transfer." I think it's really market testing at a huge scale with minimum financial input.  And for a small designer, it's a HUGE resource that I'm really thankful for.  And while I know that Jonathan raises some good points about the difficulty of working when you've already been paid, I think that kind of pressure to ship (i.e. people already gave you money!) is hugely positive.

That was enough to make a traditional print run (of 1000 books) more sensible than a POD or small-scale printer (which would let me print in tiny batches). So I bought 1000 copies.

For Kickstarter at least, the dashboard tells you which pledges are still awaiting processing, but you don't have any control over the process, you just have to wait for Amazon to sort out the issues with those people. For my Kickstarters, everything has worked out within a week or so for the few pledges that had issues, but it sounds like if you're looking at tens of thousands of dollars, the percentage of "lost" money due to this could be notable.<br/><br/>I've backed a project (documentary film) where the guy sent out multiple updates asking people to please check their Amazon settings, because enough hadn't processed yet that he wasn't able to start the project yet.<br/><br/>I guess the only thing you can do is factor that into your overhead from the beginning - like "ok, 5% to Kickstarter/whatever platform, 5% in credit card fees, 5% for deadbeats/mistakes/etc".

In flexible funding, you just get the payments the minute they're made. In fixed funding, once the target has been hit, your sum is immediately dispersed to you, and all further payments are sent to you the minute they're made.<br/><br/>And Paypal doesn't charge a flat rate: it charges twenty-five cents on every transaction, plus a small percentage. What this means: If you raise a thousand dollars in $1 increments, you're only going to get about $700. If you raise a thousand dollars in $100 increments, you're going to get about $920.<br/><br/>That was the lamest discovery of my IndieGoGo experience. I selected fixed funding, but I hit that initial target in ~28 hours. After that, every transaction got dinged that twenty-five-cent service charge. There is no option to have funds held and dispersed at the very end.

"Funds Yet To Be Dispersed" kept tallying up, until it exceeded $2500. I think it actually hit $2800 or so before the first payment got sent my way - lag time? Then IndieGoGo took their cut, and I got a big Paypal payment of around $2400-2700. The standard paypal deduction applied to that ($.25 + %) one payment. So as far as I could tell, on my end, there was a single $.25 taken out of that giant payment, plus their standard % cut. From that point on, each contribution was sent as its own Paypal payment, with the standard paypal deduction applied to every single contribution ($.25 + %).<br/><br/>Now... it's possible that behind the IndieGoGo curtain, $.25 was taken out of all the "pre-success contributions" before any money was sent to my account. But I don't believe that was the case.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JimLotFP" title="JimLotFP"><img alt="JimLotFP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JimLotFP">JimLotFP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373986/#Comment_373986" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-21T22:32:07+00:00" title="April 21, 2012 10:32PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wait, IndieGoGo changes how they pay in the middle of a campaign for fixed funding projects?<br/>\n<br/>\n(NOT GOOD)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374014/#Comment_374014" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-22T09:18:57+00:00" title="April 22, 2012  9:18AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wouldn't call it not good, I think it's more misunderstood.
