You're done with the setup phase (chargen, town creation, etc.) and everyone is at the table and ready to go. There's a beat of silence and then... what's the first thing you say? How do you actually start, specifically, word for word?<br/><br/>Please share your thoughts, tips, and experiences. Be specific to a particular game if possible, but more general advice is welcome too. What works? What doesn't? Be as ultra specific as you can, writing out a little script if possible. That's the goal here. We already have lots of stuff in books like, "Frame a scene about X" or "Start the party outside the dungeon." I'm looking for the actual words spoken.<br/><br/>Go!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120881/#Comment_120881" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T03:00:09+00:00" title="January 21, 2008  3:00AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm pretty certain the first word out of my mouth is usually "okay" <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Then I will almost always start with a description of the world, zooming in on the location where game opens. By whole world I don't necessarily mean the planet (though in a Sci-Fi game I might start at an even larger scale) but whatever is necessary to give everyone a sense of place and flavour. This would be the case even if we have just introduced the world in more thematic detail.<br/><br/>So I might say something \n<blockquote><br/>Okay. It is daybreak over the mountains at the edge of the stormy northern sea where the city of Sudar is located. The air is full of the smell of salt water and fish from the dockside, chilly enough to see your breath before you and clear enough to see all the way across the fens to the mountain peaks. The city is just waking up: the knights are calling out to each other as the guard changes on the castle wall, and the monks are finishing their morning prayers and setting to work on washing the temple floors. At the entrance to the city a line of farmers are waiting on the frosty road for the gates to open, bringing their cattle to the weekly market<br/></blockquote>\nAfter that I would zoom in to where the characters are located, knowing they have that picture in their mind. Usually I would just do them in order, going round the table, saying something about where each one is, and then move on to the first scenes, character introductions, or whatever goes next in that game. <br/><br/>So the start is all about setting the scene and the feel, with smells, sounds, sensations, colours, things to get everyone on the same page about where we are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120887/#Comment_120887" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T03:28:15+00:00" title="January 21, 2008  3:28AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "So, you're all members of the retinue of Inquisitor Valant.

I'll have explained what Blue City, and so on, before and during chargen.<br/><br/>I tend to give the information in short chunks. During chargen, I'll say things like: "It's set in Blue City, which is a sort of mindworld. Everyone who exists in the real world exists in Blue City".<br/><br/>Then do a bit of chargen and, later, say "You're Mystery Agents. You hunt down what are called <i>Hostile Personalities</i>: they're criminals in the real world, so you hunt down their criminal personalities so they're not criminals anymore".<br/><br/>Then a bit more dice rolling. Rather than explaining everything, I wait for questions to come to me: "What's Access?".<br/><br/>And at some point I'll explain that this game can work different ways: it can be Film Noir or The Matrix or a spy thriller.<br/><br/>Then, by the time we're ready to start, all I need to say is "So you've descended into Blue City...", as above. And there'll be a couple of questions as we go along, which I'll deal with: "Do I have a gun?", "No, you've got to make an Access roll to pick one up or produce one from your pocket".<br/><br/>I probably won't explain the resolution system fully until the first time we use it. And, the first time someone picks up anything, I'll make them do an Access roll.<br/><br/>Does that help?

Prompt for input on colour, and open the door for dark fate hints.  Then, force them to make decisions <i>about each other</i> before they can move closer to the Witch.

She's just heard about Solars in the area, or Anathema as she calls them, and she wants you dealt with.

The first roll was shortly after.  The Twilight summoned an Elemental, which I gave as an automatic success, but then had to roll to dominate the creature to serve him.  I helped the player pick out the proper ability, and then possible augments, and then we rolled. He got a critical, and soundly bound the elemental to his will.

I always found there's a slight chance of a lack of buy-in when it comes to dungeon crawling.  And probably not because the D&amp;D players don't want the game to go there (they're playing D&amp;D).   They often don't want to go through the boring, cliche process of getting there.<br/><br/>I think one of the worst ways to start a session is to describe the setting and then ask what the players do.  By this I mean excluding the description of the current situation anything that interests the players or characters and then relying on them to figure out what they should want to do (much less do).  What the players (or characters) want should be established asap.<br/><br/>"You're in the main square of the small city of Ranath.  Peasants and merchants are walking to and fro.

Works in any situation where you've got a likely contest that players are likely to be involved in. I say contest to mean any situation of player vs something in the game, though not always combat.

Then if we're at a convention or a game day where we're at a table in the middle of a bunch of other tables with people walking around, I'll apologize for having to meet here in the cafeteria while they're finishing renovating the meeting rooms. The rest of the game session is played in character -- I'm Agent Graves, and the players are new recruits to Mystery Agent status. We're going to be simulating a dive into Blue City and of course I don't need to tell you that Blue City is [I tell them what Blue City is] or how dives go because they've already been on dives into Green zones, you'll still go to the Slab, get strapped down and injected with blah blah blah. Basically, I tell them that they already know this stuff, tell them the stuff they know, and tell them I don't need to tell them that.<br/><br/>It works.<br/><br/>For anything else, my first words are usually: "Fade in from black. The camera is focused in on..." <br/><br/>Ever since running Primetime Adventures, every game I've GMed tends to be framed as the television or movie adaptation of the game we're playing. Every game session of the current thing I'm running starts out: "The television has warmed up, the children have gathered around the set, and the commercial for [whatever] has just ended. We cut to black and 'Previously, on...'" Because I know some of the main scenes, the major NPCs, and/or the focus of what the players want to do that session, I'll do an actual recap that's not a recap of the previous episode, but a recap that shows certain people and themes that might come up in the session. These clips may have come from the prior game session, they may have come from sessions weeks and weeks ago. They're re-edited to emphasize certain things and dialogue may be moved around or used in voiceovers for action sequences that weren't married together in actual play in prior game sessions. Tonight's game was the first we've had since a month and a half, so instead of a short 'Previously, on...' recap, we had an hour-long recap special, sort of like how Lost has that one-hour season summary episode that your Tivo is tricked into thinking is a new episode but it's really just a crappy clip show with a stupid voiceover. We had the actors explain how they saw their roles, the writers talking about different plotlines, and several clips from the show taken completely out of order and context.<br/><br/>Loads of fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Merten" title="Merten"><img alt="Merten" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://merten.kapsi.fi/pics/fiat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Merten">Merten</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121640/#Comment_121640" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T02:06:34+00:00" title="January 24, 2008  2:06AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2008 2:06AM by Merten.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After the characters are ready, in one way or another (they could have a sketchy background or just a name and a few lines, whatever), it's like:<br/><br/>"Okay, you are leaving for a cruise. The ship departs at 6pm, which means that you have to be at the terminal by 5.15pm at the latest. Who is there first and at what time?"<br/><br/>(The players decide who comes first, usually based on what kind of mindset their character has, which starts the process of establishing the characters)<br/><br/>"Right, Anna, being the prompt management-type of lass she is, arrives early. Mats, the rich lawyer, comes in second with a good margin of time, but not too early... Anna, what are you wearing and what does Anna look like?"<br/><br/>"Does she have a bag? What's in the bag?"<br/><br/>"What kid of cellphone does she have?"<br/><br/>And the same thing for every character, and then backing out and letting the players to establish the scene further (they are in a cruise terminal, they know what cruise terminals are like - and they probably have a beer or something).<br/><br/>I quite often start like this, since the kicks on two of the most important process of the game, establishing a character for a player (who am I? What do my clothes, accessories, time-management and what not tell me about me?) as a person, and establishing characters in general for all players. Establishing the starting scene or situtation kind of rides alongsides of this, and once the characters are established, players are happy to move on to explore the situtation, and then proceed forward.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121678/#Comment_121678" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T09:17:43+00:00" title="January 24, 2008  9:17AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: M Eryesen</cite>"You're in the main square of the small city of Ranath.

I think they should also probably be in the direction that play can go in (or will go in).  For example, in a D&amp;D game that's going to be about clearing dungeons of monsters, goals about winning the county dress making competition likely isn't going to fit well.

It was a one shot of Don't Rest Your Head that I GMed for Ryan Macklin.  In it, Ryan chose to play Shane Vendrell, the weasley aide to Vic Mackey in the FX series The Shield.  Ryan chose to play Shane at a particular moment in the TV series, right after Shane had murdered one of the team because he was afraid he was going to be ratted out to the police.  I started the game very slowly.  It was our first game together ever, it was over Skype, and it was pretty dark stuff.<br/><br/>ME: "Shane, you have just returned home after witnessing the murder and the burning of the body of Guardo, a man who died for your sins... a man who Vic believed had murdered Lem.  It\u2019s dark in your apartment. No lights, but its late, about 3 in the morning."<br/><br/>I walked Ryan through the realization that Shane's wife and son were missing and that something was in the apartment with him, but only showing up in the corner of his eye or in reflections (bathroom and hallway mirrors).  Shane drew his gun and fired on the crome handle on his fridge and dashed out into the night, hopping in his truck and driving to anywhere but his apartment, knowing he'd lost it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meguey" title="Meguey"><img alt="Meguey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lumpley.com/megweb/dollz/1001.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meguey">Meguey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122355/#Comment_122355" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T10:55:40+00:00" title="January 28, 2008 10:55AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Beat.<br/>Beat.<br/>"The court of the great Sultan is at peace, for the moment..."

In recording and listening to games, I\u2019ve noticed that I have the habit of taking a long time to get to \u2018play\u2019--too long!  So I\u2019ve been working on streamlining the time from sitting down at the table to the point of actual gaming.  Three points I\u2019m hoping to make in the episode are 1) getting to \u2018play\u2019 quickly is important for player satisfaction--which could mean things like getting through character creation quickly and deferring rules explanation to the point it\u2019s needed in the game, etc; 2) it\u2019s useful have some sort of signal or ritual that \u2018play\u2019 has started (as has been mentioned in other threads I think); and 3) present a \u2018situation\u2019 confronting the characters early if not immediately.  Point 3 is my general response to John\u2019s original post-- I want the first thing I say to inspire action.  An example from Dreamation: \u2018From seven separate entrances you each enter the chamber.  In the chamber is an altar.  On the altar is a chalice glowing with an internal light.  This is the Holy Grail.  You know it.  Who gets the Grail?\u2019<br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122371/#Comment_122371" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T11:28:37+00:00" title="January 28, 2008 11:28AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, hey, here's another one:<br/><br/>"ALERT!
