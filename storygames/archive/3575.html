My name's Michael. I've been lurking for a bit, but I finally decided to post.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile discussing diceless mechanics and forum-based roleplaying at another site I had an idea for a (semi)GM-less forum game. I'm not sure how 'do-able' it is, and since I'm not a programmer of any sort, I'm fairly certain I'll never know. This was a sudden 'hey, this sounds cool' kind of thing, so I thought I'd post it here.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe concept is built around random generators of the sort you can find at Seventh Sanctum. Of course, this all also suggests a group of dedicated players. Basically, a genre is decided on (space opera, horror, contemporary fantasy, whatever). The group of players come to an agreement on the generalities of the game world, and basic target benchmarks for DCs. Then, as a group, they create a collection of unnamed NPCs (and Beasties, if appropriate) in which ever game system they'll be using; I'd suggest something simple, and probably diceless. These NPCs are entered as a 'list' for an Encounter Random Generator. Or, an alternative would be to create randomizers for all character stats.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, each player creates situations they'd like to see happen In Game. They come up with one short, descriptive sentence per each number of players involved in the game (for example, if there are five players Tom writes five sentences). These are entered as a 'list' for a Situation Random Generator.<br/>\n<br/>\nGameplay is semi-freeform, players create the narrative as they go. Whenever a character becomes involved in conflict with an NPC they use the Encounter Random Generator to create the opposition's traits. Conflict proceeds normally. Either the player or another player may narrate the outcome. I'm thinking a random generator for each individual Trait would be better suited for this.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any time in the game, any player may roll on the Situation Random Generator and bring the result into play. The player has the right to play the situation with his own character, or toss it into another character's path.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize that play should be policed in some way. Maybe a player takes on the role of Judge for a certain amount of time. Judge duties should rotate on some type of schedule.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I'd like for the Random Generators would be something along the line of Invisible Castle. Something that documents the rolls and provides a tag to be placed into the post, similar to a dice roll.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are just some basic ideas of course. I realize it needs a lot of fleshing out, but I like it for what it is nonetheless.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80504/#Comment_80504" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-10T20:43:47+00:00" title="July 10, 2007  8:43PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 10, 2007 8:44PM by Andy.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey man, welcome to the site!<br/><br/>Can you throw some links for Seventh Sanctum/Invisible Castle?

Whatever goes between the  tags is what'll be displayed that many times; in this case, a result from the table 'main'. <br/><br/>The sgtable section:<br/>the numbers to the left of the first comma on a given table row represent relative probabilities - the higher the number, the more likely you are to roll it. If you keep them all at '1', everything has the same chance of being rolled.   'main' also has a chance to call 'subtable1', which in turn has a chance of calling in a result from one of the other generators on the site, '<a href="http://www.random-generator.com/index.php?title=Arabesque_Names" rel="nofollow">Arabesque Names</a>' (specifically, the 'main' table from  that generator). This way, you can use results from any portion of any table on the whole site, including many name generators, treasure generators, and all kinds of other goodness. Plus, as you create multiple generators for your game, they can call each other's pieces as needed.  That should get you started - post here if you need help. <br/><br/>Happy Generator-crafting!                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_80515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malthusian" title="Malthusian"><img alt="Malthusian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malthusian">Malthusian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80515/#Comment_80515" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-10T22:27:04+00:00" title="July 10, 2007 10:27PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the info.
