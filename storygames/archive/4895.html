Here's the idea:<br/>\n<br/>\n* There are no "spells" or "spell slots."<br/>\n* A magical effect is tied to a particular Knowledge sub-skill.  Blowing down the gates of a castle, for example, would be Knowledge: Architecture.<br/>\n* To see whether you know the mystical principles underlying this effect, make a Knowledge skill check.<br/>\n* The desired effect is classified as Apprentice (DC 10), Journeyman (DC 15), Master (DC 20) or Grand Master (DC 25).<br/>\n* Magic would generally require gestures, speeches, candles, pentagrams, voodoo connections, etc.<br/>\n* Magic would also come with certain "laws" - nothing longer than an hour, gotta touch the target, etc.<br/>\n* Circumventing these restrictions is a matter for Spellcraft - tweaking your knowledge to achieve specialized effects, like longer duration, silent casting, etc.<br/>\n* Casting is done with Concentration: maybe you know what to do, but doing it right is difficult.  Concentration DC is probably 15 + level.<br/>\n* If you miss your Concentration DC by 5 or more, there's a freaky mishap.<br/>\n* I guess you can Take 20 on the Concentration check by doing everything juuuuuust right, but it takes a long time.  Think Gandalf at the gates of Moria.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnder this system:<br/>\n* Wizards can improvise spells, rather than using slots, but will probably take longer after much thought.<br/>\n* Meta-Magic feats go away, replaced by Spellcraft and the feats which boost it.<br/>\n* Item Creation feats might get folded into Spellcraft &amp; Use Magic Device.<br/>\n* Anyone with the requisite skills can bumble through a spell or two.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill to be Resolved:<br/>\n* I'd like to throw Decipher Script in there for something useful.<br/>\n* Exactly what types of effect rank as Apprentice, Journeyman, Master, Grandmaster<br/>\n* Exactly what's possible using Spellcraft<br/>\n* Role of Druids, Clerics, Adepts in this system.<br/>\n* Could Experts with the specific skills cast spells too?  I'd like to say no...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109735/#Comment_109735" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-26T20:07:14+00:00" title="November 26, 2007  8:07PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's hard to comment when what you want isn't really nailed down yet.  <br><br>For defining the laws of magic, have you seen the game Mortal Coil?<br><br>More importantly, what gameplay experiences are you looking to eliminate from D&amp;D, and what do you want to create instead?                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daztur" title="Daztur"><img alt="Daztur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daztur">Daztur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109746/#Comment_109746" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-26T22:23:16+00:00" title="November 26, 2007 10:23PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Potential problems:<br>1.

Rather than allow Take20, I'd assume that any spellcaster who was not in a distracting situation would simply not need to worry about making a Concentration check. As for tying spellcasting to Knowledge sub-skills, you end up hamstringing the core spellcasting classes, as they all get only 2+Int bonus skill points per level. You'd need to re-jigger them, else wind up with bards being the most powerful casters in the game.

You need to decide what you're trying to achieve before we can suggest how to get there. E.g., "Could Experts with the specific skills cast spells too? I'd like to say no..." That sounds like something you need to tell us--not the other way round. For going on 6-7 years, I've tinkered with a very high-magic setting in which the world is literally awash in the blood of the dead god of magic. Everyone can do a little magic. And, of course, you've got the other end of the spectrum, say Conan, where only a rare few have access. Keep in mind, you can also tier the access by tweaking the relevant skills as class skills for some classes and cross-class skills for others.<br><br>Green Ronin's True Sorcery is the product of lengthy development, starting with the Psychic's Handbook --&gt; Black Company --&gt; True20 --&gt; True Sorcery. It's been put through the wringer pretty good and is pretty stable. I'd pick that up and comb for more ideas.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: 1of3</cite>After all there is a reason, that special stuff is not tied to skills in D&amp;D.

E.g., when a caster has a certain level of proficiency with the relevant skill, he can Take 10 and accomplish that level of magic without risk of failure (provided he is not being harried or distracted). In my experience, these systems result in great moments of tension when the mage is trying to pull off something at the outer limits of his abilities--a nice analog to the fighter trying to pierce the dragon's scales with his sword.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109925/#Comment_109925" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-27T21:22:10+00:00" title="November 27, 2007  9:22PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing to consider...<br><br>It sounds like you want your magic to move more into research-based, preparation-based, solutions to major problems ("How can we get the troops through the fortress's gate?").
