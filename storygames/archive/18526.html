But we want to make it even better for next year. If you played with us, please consider taking a minute to fill out the feedback form, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1sPlQFvO1GDYc8cLKRsG8Pf_rHqs9JkEaSVR84mXTyn0/viewform" rel="nofollow">located here</a>.<br/><br/>The basics: we ran 87 sessions of 40+ different games (IIRC), sat 361 players and overflowed our room four times. I personally had a blast running Vesna Thaw, World Wide Wrestling and Hell 4 Leather, and playing The Quiet Year, Dog Eat Dog, InSpectres, Monsterhearts, Dread, and Saga of the Icelanders. Man.<br/><br/>If you didn't get a chance to play with us, you should really think about it for next year! Origins is a great "destination" con, in my opinion. And next year is going to be even more fun, if you can believe it!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
