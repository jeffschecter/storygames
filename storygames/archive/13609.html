This practice has been going on for a long, long time, by tons of players who have nothing to do with indie games.  Most of these rulesets are never released on the internet, much less published. "Hack" is just a name that's been recently given to it, as they've become more popular to share (or even commercially publish).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307534/#Comment_307534" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-09T12:45:41+00:00" title="January  9, 2011 12:45PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, Gamma World and Castle Ravenloft are essentially 4E hacks.

I mean, you don't really need to write up rules for that, right?  The rules are exactly the same, with Boardwalk now being the Duke Chapel or whatever.  And if I want to run The Mountain Witch in the setting of Moby Dick, with a bunch of harpooners going to kill the White Whale, I probably don't need to write up a hack of it. The players just say "Call me Ishmael" and we're off.<br/><br/>When it comes to deep hacks... well, Castle Ravenloft isn't even a roleplaying game (whatever that means), which is one of several indications that it's pretty far from 4E, while still using those rules as the core.  Likewise, there are a lot of hacks that have gone so far that people can argue that they're really just completely different games, only somewhat inspired by whatever they've departed from. Is the Danger Patrol beta draft a hack of Savage Worlds? Kinda, but there's so much else going on there that it's easier to think of it as a separate game.<br/><br/>The boundaries between "reskin," "hack," and "completely different game" aren't clear and objective things.  All design work inevitably draws on other people's concepts and so it's really all about questions of degree.  How much new stuff (or, really, stuff stolen from a bunch of other games) are you putting forward?  How much are you indebted to one particular sources? How much does your game stand alone from its source material?<br/><br/>In my mind, "hack" is just a term for something that's in between a reskin (for which you don't need many new rules at all) and a completely separate game (something whose influences are too jumbled to consider it a direct descendant of one particular game).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307610/#Comment_307610" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-10T04:29:28+00:00" title="January 10, 2011  4:29AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've always viewed hacks as a matter of practicality - take a good, modular ruleset and add your own color, tweaking it as necessary instead of starting from scratch. I do this pretty regularly. Love in the Time of Sei\xf0 is an Archipelago II hack, and Matthijs and I charge money for it (although it is all funneled to charity).<br/><br/>But it is semantics, really - Red Box Hack is a unique game and not really a hack, for example, although it may have started that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Parke" title="Parke"><img alt="Parke" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v97/mikker/Zoosmell.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Parke">Parke</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308037/#Comment_308037" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-13T11:52:50+00:00" title="January 13, 2011 11:52AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TylerT</cite>So I have seen a bunch of hacks of various games floating around and was wondering what compels them and how they compare to "run everything as d20" mentality I saw when d20 was popular.<br/><br/>I imagine it's much more selective, like you play a specific game and you feel it fits a specific setting that you want to play so you hack it. </blockquote>\nYou're spot on with the second part. The d20 boom came from the fact that 1) D&amp;D 3 was selling really well and 2) It was now legal to make something using similar mechanics. People are more likely to buy something if it is familiar (this is why companies license properties like Star Wars or whatever). The ability to go "This is just like that game you like" is powerful.<br/><br/>I don't think that's why most hacks in the "indie" community are made. I think for most its because the authors enjoy tinkering with games and many times its easier to mess with an existing game than start from scratch. Of course, you have to examine a lot of the underlying assumptions that the original game made. I think hacks are good for the community because they increase the value of the original product and are "lab experiments" for new designs in the same way Game Chef et al are. \n<blockquote>Are hacks ever sold? If so is there ever commercial motive to hack a popular game into a popular setting? </blockquote>Depends on the legal situation. Honestly, few people besides the major companies have the money/time to sue. Also the philosophy in the "indie" community is imitation is flattery. As for "popular settings", that's also entering tricky legal land. If its sold, you either need to get the license (c.f. Green Ronin using M&amp;M3 for DC Adventures) or strip the names off and make it an homage. \n<blockquote> Are some hacks written as complete stand alone games or do players need an understanding of the hacked game to play?</blockquote>\nI think the general rule is if you make significant changes, you write it out as a stand-alone. If you are just changing colour or adding a new mechanic, you make it require the original text (in this case its like a supplement).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
