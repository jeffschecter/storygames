Thats fun for a con but not so much session after session.<br/>There will be an open when everyone gets introduced.<br/>There will be a small bit of investigation and hopefully some creepy outside stuff will present well.<br/>And then there will be lots of carnage.<br/><br/>If you let the players make their own monsters (which I highly recommend) then there is no "typical" group.  With the kids you might get away with the breakfast club tropes - geek, jock, slacker, princess etc but they rarely follow any pattern for me.<br/><br/>Basically, every time I've tried the "play to find out" thing with MaoCT I've stumbled pretty hard because the characters and monsters are not at all self directed.  When I've thrown even the skeleton of an adventure onto the session its turned out much better.  That may be an artifact of my GMing style or it may be that I've been playing with folks who want more direction from the GM than others.<br/><br/>I don't tend to push on the Sorcerer hard bargain side of things because I find the humor to come from the juxtaposition of the kids innocence and the monsters failure to understand good and bad.  If you push the good/bad decisions over onto the kids, it feels like the kids loose their innocence too quickly. YMMV.<br/><br/>If you have enough players or players willing to split characters, divide them into pairings and have 1 play the kid and one play their monster.  Switch them up if someone is always playing a kid and let them drive the monster for a while.  It gets some work off you as a GM, and makes the monsters much more creative and troublesome for the kids.<br/><br/>Make it craft night, and make them draw their monsters on paper plates and hold them up in front when they speak as the monster.  (Completely stolen from the playtest that was run at D*Con in 2007? that I played in).<br/><br/>Look at the Candewick Manor supplement where the kids are the monsters and each player only has 1 character to keep track of (with less monsterous powers but still fun).  That does neat things with turning temporary traits called Echos into game affecting relationships in play.  Also a friend dubbed the setting "Mope: the Saddening" so that funny.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joey" title="Joey"><img alt="Joey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joey">Joey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385149/#Comment_385149" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-14T17:41:00+00:00" title="July 14, 2012  5:41PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've run a campaign of Monsters, a campaign of Candlewick, and several con games of each.  It may be an artifact of my clumsy GMing style, but I usually "play-to-find-out" once I've established some clear motivations for each Monster and PC.  Out of the box none of that stuff is pushed forward, but if you pay attention to Favorite Things and Relationships, you can still make it tick.  Get an idea of what will push each character's buttons, set up a situation that pushes against two or three at once, then ask leading questions of the other players until everyone's invested.  Play out the rules, give everyone the consequences of their actions, and the plot will go gonzo all by itself.<br/><br/>In base Monsters, power level is a big issue.  Don't expect a creative player group to have much trouble worming their way out of any challenge you put in front of them.  If you want something to be difficult or take more than one decision to complete, you're going to have to put some dice on the table.<br/><br/>Just as an aside, you've definitely got some control over tone, but the default assumption is WAAAAAYYYY darker than Miyazaki.<br/><br/>Forlorn1 is totally right about Candlewick.  YMMV, but for me, it was worth its weight in gold.  I've run some very, very fun games out of that book.  Very different tone and setting from the base game, but well worth a read for the way it sets up a character-based campaign in a box, then makes that campaign replayable.<br/><br/>Forlorn1 is being modest, btw.  He played in a couple of those one-shots I ran, and he's damn good.<br/><br/>Also, be silly.  Work with the players to come up with fun voices for each monster, then ham them up for all you're worth.  If you don't get a full-table laugh at least once a session, you're playing wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385194/#Comment_385194" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-15T18:16:00+00:00" title="July 15, 2012  6:16PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played in a one-shot of MaoCT, and GMed a one-shot.  Both times we used pre-made characters.  <br/><br/>I thought it worked well given that just a tiny bit of tension or situation and the PCs + their monsters will cause lots of issues.  It was great fun and I thought brought out a ton of childhood issues.  I thought the pregenerated PCs were very well done for that.  Mostly the action was the kids trying to do small things with their monsters, and then dealing with all the fallout that resulted.  The biggest hurdle for me was handling all of the monsters as GM.  <br/><br/>Has anyone played with a player for each kid and a player for each monster?                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
