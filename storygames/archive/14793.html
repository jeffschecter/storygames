You might have also noticed we're going to be running Games on Demand again this year, with support from IPR and many great volunteers. I've been thinking a lot about it for the last few weeks, trying to make sure we have enough people and energy to make it a big success. <br/><br/>To that end, I hatched an idea with Jason about putting the <i>game</i> in Games on Demand. We have certain objectives (having enough GMs and hosts to meet demand, running fun games, collecting lots of tickets, getting people excited about buying games, etc.)- Why not match them with achievements and prizes to make things interesting? <br/><br/>Here's our take on what might be good achievements (thanks to Jason):<br/><br/><b>PLATINUM, ELECTRUM, GOLDEN TICKETMASTER</b><br/>GM who turns in the most tickets overall (First, second, third place)<br/><br/><b>LORDS OF NIGHT</b><br/>GM who turns in the most tickets Thursday night<br/>GM who turns in the most tickets Friday night<br/>GM who turns in the most tickets Saturday night<br/><br/><b>HOST OF FURY</b><br/>Person who hosts the most 2 hour slots<br/><br/><b>IRON GROGNARD</b><br/>GM who rocks a table during the most slots<br/><br/>In order to make this work we need worthwhile rewards. At this point I'm thinking of games as prizes, contributed by designers/publishers as a promotion. I'll try to arrange for a side table to display the games throughout the show, and then on Sunday we can tally the results and let the winners take first pick of the available games. At the moment that table will include <i>Fiasco</i>, <i>the Fiasco Companion</i> and (I believe) the <i>Dungeon World Red Book</i>. If you're interested in contributing, let us know.<br/><br/>What else might make for a good prize? Maybe a free round of drinks at the Embassy bar? A backroom play-test with your favorite designer? Ideas are welcome, but keep in mind someone has to donate the time/drinks/etc.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
