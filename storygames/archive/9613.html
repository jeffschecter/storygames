I am doing this because I am OCD about this kind of thing. There are eight Origin archetypes that describe in broad terms the type of life your character had when she was growing up. Then there are eight archetypes that describe the circumstances in which she left home and went to the temple. 8 times 8 equals creative exhaustion for yours truly, even though I've got plenty of playtest characters to choose from.<br/><br/>Ryan then tries to smack some sense into me. This would be like if D&amp;D came with example characters of every possible combination of species and class. It'd be huge! From the Evil Hat side of things, Spirit of the Century only had <b>three</b> example characters despite a lot more archetypes. So, it'd be better if I stuck to a small group of signature, inspiring characters and let everything else be open for players to interpret without my baggage.<br/><br/>That's all well and good, but I still don't feel like Do has the advantaged position that either of those games has. In D&amp;D's case, they're using signature characters to show optimal character builds for monster fightin'. Do is a different sort of game, so there really is no "optimal" Aide/Runaway or Dreamer/Orphan combo.<br/><br/>Both D&amp;D and Spirit of the Century also have the benefit of strong roots in a well-established genre, "fantasy hack n' slash" for the former and "two-fisted pulp adventures" for the latter. You can afford to just show a Rocketeer and Rosie the Riveter to get the gist of a pulp adventure game, but "coming-of-age road trip" isn't quite as iconic.<br/><br/>So, the trick is thinking of some iconic signature characters, both as a way to demonstrate a variety of possible characters you can play and to really nail down the baseline of this genre.<br/><br/>I mean, I could just file the serial numbers off these characters:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/34/Aang_Official.png/220px-Aang_Official.png"/> <img alt="image" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Katara.png/250px-Katara.png"/> <img alt="image" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1e/Sokka_the_Thinker.png/255px-Sokka_the_Thinker.png"/> <img alt="image" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/Toph_ep26.png/230px-Toph_ep26.png"/><br/><br/>And four characters are going to be on the cover already:<br/><br/><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_l8FseK3oHxY/SZBwiOjpozI/AAAAAAAAAH8/WLvB6pBBxZY/s1600-h/3265170826_7f330281a1_b.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_l8FseK3oHxY/SZBwiOjpozI/AAAAAAAAAH8/WLvB6pBBxZY/s400/3265170826_7f330281a1_b.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>Would that be lazy of me or just an homage to the inspirational source, like the Rocketeer-ish and Rosie-ish characters in Spirit of the Century?<br/><br/>Oh, and more broadly, how do you feel about signature characters in general?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213261/#Comment_213261" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-18T17:25:49+00:00" title="June 18, 2009  5:25PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think anyone will resent you for not having 64 example characters.

The stories of Do are centered around teenagers helping people, which gets them into gonzo trouble and changes them in the process.<br/><br/>So D&amp;D's roles assume you have some buy-in for killing monsters and the roles broadly define different ways you can help the group do that. (Am I right in that assumption? I've not played 4E.)<br/><br/>I suppose that Do would assume you have buy-in for being a mostly well-meaning, troublemaking teenager. That means Do's roles would define the different ways you can get into trouble. Hmmm... Okay, extrapolating this with the characters I posted above, I guess I should ask myself:<br/>"How does Aang help people and how does he get into trouble?"<br/>"How does the Scarecrow help people and how does he get into trouble?"<br/><br/>And so on...

Signature characters blow, if you mean in the White Wolf sense where they're actually canonical and you shape the setting for the chaacters and characters for the setting. I was talking with Elizabeth recently about how Nobilis' example of play opens with a giant fight scene (because R. Sean heard players were having trouble running fights in Nobilis) even though Nobilis isn't really about fights, so it gives players a weird picture of the game.  There's this essential tension in all examples, basically, between being <i>demonstrative</i>, showing the players how the game works, and being <i>representative</i>, showing players what playing the game is actually like.  WW signature characters, IMO, generally mix these up all over the place and uber-fail.  They're not functional characters that any player would actually play, especially not as a starting character, so they basically only demonstrate the themes of the setting and stuff, which makes them super boring.  They're not characters so much as giant walking stereotypes and are therefore bad example characters for people picking up the game.<br/><br/>A better question to ask, rather than how many, is what purpose(s) do you want these example characters to serve?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213322/#Comment_213322" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-19T05:39:39+00:00" title="June 19, 2009  5:39AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 19, 2009 5:44AM by DanielSolis.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're right about the practical and thematic uses of signature characters being difficult to combine, so I think these would specifically focus on the thematic side. These would be example characters establishing the baseline of the genre and the protagonists.<br/><br/>Does that make them boring? Potentially, but you can't deviate from a baseline that hasn't been established. And even if they are boring, at least now they're only 3 or 4 pages of the book instead of 30. :P<br/><br/>The compromise here might be making one of the signature characters the identifiable "Tenchi" straight man of the group while making the rest of the characters more ca-razy.<br/><br/>All that having been said, I would <b>not</b> go the White Wolf route and actually make them canonical to any kind of lore or whatever. That's taking it from "here's what the game feels like" to "here's the outline of my novel."<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Oh, a friend on Twitter made a really good point though.\n<blockquote>signature characters only really help as examples.

Each character is an example, and there is no such thing in RPGs as "too many examples". Also, they could be used in in-game text to be an anchor, which the reader can follow through the book as they read rules examples, setting text, and so on.<br/><br/>With 64 signature characters (or, well, 8) you could demonstrate what a "normal" character would look like, a normal character with a different build, a normal character with 1-2 "weird points", a totally weird/out there character, and so on. Plus, they become a stable of NPCs that can be used in play. Or, if you provide the stats, they could also be used as PCs for quick play.<br/><br/>The only thing where signature characters become problematic is:<br/>* When the signature characters do things that are impossible for the PCs to do (see: Some WoD books, and many console games; "Cut Scene vs When the player has control of the character").<br/>* When the game talk on forums and the like focuses more on the coolness of the background characters than actual play (I see this in various Exalted threads in RPGNet... however, they're balanced with triple the number of AP threads, so it's not "bad" or anything. Though clearly, some folks think more about the awesome signature characters and their adventures than they do their own characters).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213434/#Comment_213434" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-19T12:20:22+00:00" title="June 19, 2009 12:20PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The free NPC download is probably something I'll do as continued online support for the game once it's released, hopefully using actual player characters. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213450/#Comment_213450" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-19T13:02:24+00:00" title="June 19, 2009  1:02PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 19, 2009 1:03PM by DannyK.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy's last post covers most of what I wanted to say -- signature characters fulfill a lot of roles for White Wolf, most of which don't apply to indie games.  There seems to be a  dress requirement involving fetish gear.  <br/><br/>Example characters tend to fall into two groups -- archetypal examples and "look what else you can do with the system!" type characters.  I'd like some of both, but please don't leave out the archetypal characters -- they give people a sense of what they can play, they get people excited about playing the game, and they give newcomers a shortcut to character creation.  They can look in the book and say, "I want to play that guy, only with a pet snake instead of a hawk."  Or whatever.  <br/><br/>And count me as another person who'd totally love extra sample characters online, I hate making up NPC's from scratch.<br/><br/>Edit: who are those strange little people with the arrows on their heads?

YK introduces a signature character for each of the six animal types (<a href="http://www.sunsetgames.co.jp/rpg/youyake/1024_768.jpg" rel="nofollow">the cover</a> shows each of them in their human and animal forms), and over the course of the book you get to know them through seeing them in both gameplay examples and artwork that shows them in a great variety of situations. To me this is a better way to give the reader a feel for the overall experience of the game than having different characters in each illustration. Not only could I make a character like <a href="http://www.sunsetgames.co.jp/rpg/youyake/kemomimi01_600.jpg" rel="nofollow">Suzune</a>, but my character will get to live in a world where she might chat with a spider goddess, attract the curiosity of adventurous young boys, or sit with a tanuki friend eating soba noodles.

That clarifies a lot.<br/><br/>Thinking about it more, it seems to me that even if you like the idea of signature characters, most of the attempts at implementing them have just been piss-poor. I really like how they're used in Yuuyake Koyake as I said, but the book actually gives you some reasons to like those characters--they're cute and charming, and you get to know them some--whereas (for example) the ones in D&amp;D 3.x are mostly just the same bland characters being repeated over and over in the artwork. If there was a manga featuring Suzune and Riko I'd be more than happy to read them, but a novel about Mialee and Redgar? That already sounds like a waste of paper.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213643/#Comment_213643" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-20T15:27:17+00:00" title="June 20, 2009  3:27PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I firmly believe that the only way for a game designer to create NPCs that are as interesting to players as PCs are to them, said NPCs must be <em>systemically impossible</em> and possessed of an <em>impenetrable mystery that is never revealed.</em></p>\n<p>See the Lady of Pain and the Scarlet Empress.</p>\n<p>Also, YHVH.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213661/#Comment_213661" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-20T19:07:05+00:00" title="June 20, 2009  7:07PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's nothing that Shreyas <i>doesn't</i> feel stridently. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>No worries though, I won't be using these characters as canonical figures of any sort, just a smaller, more concise group of example characters than I was originally planning. Will some players find those examples unnecessary? Possibly. If so, at least it's only a couple pages rather than the big chunk I had been undertaking before this thread.<br/><br/>If you've seen the artwork Liz Hooper's done so far, you can see that she's tried very hard to give each pilgrim a unique appearance, so there's no real danger of the D&amp;D art/marketing trap.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/daniel_solis/sets/72157613764943169/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3367/3416225453_9ae2887e47.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>Ralph, I'd be okay with a single character as an example, but Do uses a collaborative group character creation, so each character's writeup mentions two other characters. A couple more pages isn't a big deal for me though. As you said, following the same group of characters across a running example of play throughout the book would be useful and that's something I've wanted to do for a long time.<br/><br/>I may have found a compromise: A small group of characters, maybe four, but each with a sidebar noting possible variations on their background. Let's use Aang as an example:\n<blockquote><b>Pilgrim Aang the Last Airbender</b><br/><i>Spiritual/Runaway</i>: Aang is a young monk at the peaceful Air Temple with a strong talent for airbending. He is 13 years old when he finds out that he is the current incarnation of the Avatar, the spirit who keeps all the worlds elemental forces in balance. Intimidated by the cosmic responsibility now resting on his shoulders, he runs away from the Air Temple and his destiny.<br/><br/>Sidebar: What if Aang were a <i>Warrior/Runaway</i>?<br/>Sensing that the balance of power is tilting towards war, Aang tries to convince the monks of the air temple to take pre-emptive action. Being pacifists, they see no need to resort to violence even in self-defense. Frustrated with their lack of foresight, Aang runs away to find some one who will help him fight.<br/><br/>Sidebar: What if Aang were a <i>Spiritual/Orphan</i>?<br/>Just as Aang is told that he is the Avatar, fires erupt all around the temple. Mechanized armies march up the sacred mountains, crushing holy buildings. Aang loses sight of the other monks in the ensuing chaos and barely escapes with his life.</blockquote>\nThe goal being that the "what if" questions help explain what those archetypes mean, but also ensure that the characters not set-in-stone "canon" characters in the WW/D&amp;D style.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213685/#Comment_213685" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-21T00:35:08+00:00" title="June 21, 2009 12:35AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>and there is no such thing in RPGs as "too many examples"</blockquote>\nSurely you've read <i>Nobilis</i>?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213748/#Comment_213748" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-21T13:51:01+00:00" title="June 21, 2009  1:51PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Ralph, I'd be okay with a single character as an example, but Do uses a collaborative group character creation, so each character's writeup mentions two other characters.</div>\n</blockquote>\nThat sounds like a totally justifiable game specific reason to have multiple examples in character creation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">I may have found a compromise: A small group of characters, maybe four, but each with a sidebar noting possible variations on their background.
