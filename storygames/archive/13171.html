It's inspired by rules-oriented fantasy like Lost, Deathnote, Highlander, and Inception. Stories that present a set of rules, then follows characters as they explore the boundaries of those rules. The setting closely resembles our modern world with some notable twists.<br/><br/>First, all nations are monarchies, with varying ranges of oppression. A handful really severe third-world dictatorships exist, but most nations are quite livable. All the trappings of first-world modern society exist, like suits and cars and jobs and the internet.<br/><br/>Second, some people have an ability to rule. That is, they can create a rule like "No one may enter this room without my permission." or "Men must bow in my presence." and the universe obeys, to an extent. It takes a significant amount of willpower to impose and maintain a rule, but it is easier when the rule is worded carefully and specifically. <br/><br/>Third, people who rule are, naturally, Rulers. They are members of a ruling elte. However, the ability to rule is not hereditary. Being in the monarchy does not necessarily mean you can rule, nor vice versa. That is potentially a source of tension. A rule does not need to be public for its effects to take place, which makes navigating the social dynamics of rulers precarious.<br/><br/>Fourth, there are Laws, which supercede most Rules. Laws of gravity, of thermodynamics, etc. You can try to break these laws with rules, but you can usually only do so on small scales. It is far easier to make Rules for human behavior than for physics, but it can be done. <br/><br/>The central "cool thing" of the setting is people finding loopholes or directly trying to break rules. However, that's not enough of a situation to get a story going. I need something compelling for players to <i>do</i>. Any ideas?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon" title="JBMannon"><img alt="JBMannon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon">JBMannon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296610/#Comment_296610" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-12T15:00:07+00:00" title="October 12, 2010  3:00PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Someone has Ruled the stars from the sky and the moon above the south pole.

So the player characters were apprentice wizards or whatever, and the rules were more or less set and hidden as they begin, but as they figure out the rules they gain the power to change them. Like you cast light a few times, and finally notice that you always take a bonus when you're alone and casting light, so now you've figured out a rule, and that gives you some minor power to mess with it. Figuring out bigger rules, like that casting a power draws power from somewhere else, gives you more power to change them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296623/#Comment_296623" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-12T15:50:13+00:00" title="October 12, 2010  3:50PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Be sure to find and watch the TV series <i>Kings</i>.

Certain neighboring nations have taken the opportunity to snatch it up for what little mineral wealth and strategic advantages it offers, but none have been able to gain a foothold because of an intricate web of Rules that stymie their advances, leaving it an awkward demilitarized zone. The characters are agents of an interested, though not actively involved nation, that seeks to find out how to work around these shadow Rules, and who might be responsible for them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296632/#Comment_296632" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-12T16:11:38+00:00" title="October 12, 2010  4:11PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh, for a while I've been banging around a game/setting, where people have objective levels of Authority, some more some less, they Command and the world obeys (to a degree, and only those with lower Authority).

You could have a PVP situation where each player commands their own country or district thereof and jockeys for power, or else a more traditional players-vs-world situation with the players taking the parts of important politicians trying to guide their country to supremacy on a global scale.

However, ruling is too big an elephant to relegate to the sidelines like that. So, there is not task resolution <i>per se</i>. Instead of a spectrum of success or failure, there is a spectrum of obedience.<br/><br/>If you "fail" at a task, it's only because you stumbled into a rule that forbids you from doing that thing. Now you know a little bit about that rule. As a player, you can then start exploring the boundaries of that rule until it is completely known.<br/><br/>I also wonder about rules you apply to yourself, perhaps called Codes. Things like "I must eat meat with every meal." or "I do not engage in violence." I wonder if those might be a useful source of points to encourage role-play or missions. Codes might be better in play if they are phrased as required actions rather than forbidden actions. It's easier to work "I must make eye contact with nobles as I speak to them" into role-play than "I must not make eye contact with a commoner."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296713/#Comment_296713" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-13T10:59:16+00:00" title="October 13, 2010 10:59AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Exploring the boundaries of hidden rules is exactly what I was aiming for in my original game, I love the idea.

I didn't even think to check. <br/><br/><i>Nobilis</i>, which I'm playing right now, sure comes to mind, yeah. <br/><br/>So does this: <i>The West Wing</i> and its ilk. I know it's not what you're thinking right now, but it might be curious to play the advisors to a Ruler... people who want to shape the world but have to convince their King or Queen to do what they want. This might work well with your failure mechanics, in which you discover not that you've failed but that someone has beaten you to a Ruling with an earlier Rule that goes against what you want now... and undoing a Rule is difficult or costly.<br/><br/>That sort of goes against the power-for-everyone dynamic of, say, <i>Nobilis</i> and <i>Inception</i>, but I mention it anyway.<br/><br/>The thing I like about making it a modern-on-its-face setting is that it implies that the world is the way it is because somebody wants it that way, end to end. Somebody wants poverty here and war over there. Somebody wants suffering in that corner and joy in that one. Someone wants dinosaurs extinct and for dragons to be imaginary and, as long as their Rules are in place, that's the way things are. It means there's a potential dramatic conflict everywhere\u2014dialogue and scenery to be had about everything.<br/><br/>The trick is to do this in a way that's new, whether that means new dramaturgically or ludicly or in the setting. Otherwise you're sort of getting close to a grandiose <i>Mage</i> campaign (not that that's bad). <br/><br/>Just to toss in a monkeywrench, what if things aren't strict monarchies but pseudo-democracies and you play Caesar. The dice represent the power of your Will to create your Rule and the colors indicate its popularity and respect (Very, Mixed, Un), and thus the likelihood that NPCs (in the traditional PC role of protagonistic upstarts) will rise up against it and need to be rebuffed, contained, or put down. How do you devise rules to protect your rules without making criminals of people you may need later?<br/><br/>I'm just spitballing.

Now you know a little bit about that rule. As a player, you can then start exploring the boundaries of that rule until it is completely known.</blockquote> That sort of implies that, if not for Rulers, anybody could kind of do whatever they wanted to, at any time. I'm guessing that ancient Rulers set down laws that kept the world/universe more or less stable and predictable, and then set to codifying how societies would function. <br/><br/>Maybe if you find the loopholes or even gaps in laws, you get wiggle room to do as you please in some narrow (or not so narrow!) milieu. Hmmmmm, that could actually flip things around - rather than pushing players into the maybe-difficult (creatively speaking) position of a) being Rulers or b) <i>not</i> being Rulers, they exist in contrast to the Rulers - - they're the sorts of folks who have stumbled on a gap in a law, and might be too afraid to tell a soul, but it's the first time they've ever seen a law contradicted, let alone bypassed, and it's really exciting!<br/><br/>I think there's a lot of thematic gold here - religion, faith, God, "the art of the possible", politics, social change, occult experiences... the Rulers and the scuff-laws (scuffing a bit of the line with one's toe, I'm imagining) are in struggle with one another, and the struggle is meaningfully difficult for both sides: if a Ruler just up and said, "New law: my laws cannot be contradicted,", he'd have a hell of a time devising new laws. Something even broader, like "There are no scuff-laws" could potentially ruin things for *all* Rulers!<br/>Since you mentioned Mage, this line of thinking brings to mind the Weaver - structure and order and form. Without a Wyrm to break things down, and a Wyld to make new things, the Weaver will eventually run out of steam and get locked in the fiber of his own creations. Scuff-laws, then, could be performing a necessary function: finding cracks and seams in the otherwise smooth and perfect order of Rulers. <br/><br/>To tie it back to mechanical stuff: "Oh, I failed to shoot him? Betcha I can kick his ass with my bare hands." Rulers and scuff-laws could engage in a sort of fencing match of logic, seeing who gets cornered first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296809/#Comment_296809" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-14T01:31:55+00:00" title="October 14, 2010  1:31AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 14, 2010 1:33AM by Destriarch.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite>For example, the Laws of thermodynamics allow a gun to work, which can be used by anyone.

You'd have people who have come entirely to depend on rules to survive, and rulers have to deal with those obligations. <br/><br/>Second, and still related to the first, the whole notion of rules dating back all through time and across the while world strikes me as too much disbelief to swallow for allowing a credible modern(ish) world. So two thoughts: you could go for a very classical notion that a ruler is intrinsically tied to his land, and two you could have rules only last while the issuing ruler still lives. So, that second makes assassination very high stakes, and the first has lots of neat implications. Most obviously, it opens up notions of conquest and legitimacy and explains the varying levels of oppression/prosperity/et cetera. But you also get Oedipal situations (no, not that kind of Oedipal) where a corrupt ruler brings plague and badness down on his lands. <br/><br/>Hope some of this is fruitful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296840/#Comment_296840" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-14T08:14:45+00:00" title="October 14, 2010  8:14AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Word Length: Yeah, that's definitely going to be a factor in the system.

A rule ends when its ruler is can no longer devote enough willpower to enforce it. That might happen in deep sleep, unconsciousness or severe stress.<br/>2. This restriction can be eased if the rule is written down. However, if the paper it's written on is destroyed, then only the ruler is keeping that rule enforced. That is why many rulers have their rules literally written in stone. (Or metal, or etched in diamond, etc.)<br/>3. Regardless, the death of a ruler ends any rules they have in place.<br/><br/>I think allegiance can play a part in this, too. Say I'm a monarch and I have imposed a rule: "All men in the kingdom must keep their hair uncut." That's a tough one to impose unless most men in the kingdom have some stake in keeping that rule alive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon" title="JBMannon"><img alt="JBMannon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon">JBMannon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296852/#Comment_296852" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-14T09:37:32+00:00" title="October 14, 2010  9:37AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You may also want to concider rule dependancies. For example: one ruler creates a rule that no one but him may enter his throne room. If other rulers base rules upon that rule, like no one may set fire to the building where the throne room resides, then the base rule would contenue to be active until those who placed dependant rules also remove their rulings. Though once the original ruler is gone the base rule becomes more flexable, maybe the room can only be entered by the original ruler's decendants or maybe only one person may enter the room at a time. Over time the base rule may accumulate so many dependants that it becomes a law. At the same time these base rules are also loosing potency as new rulings take shape arround them which is what makes holes in the laws that the rulers can exploit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296857/#Comment_296857" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-14T09:53:28+00:00" title="October 14, 2010  9:53AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why do I get the feeling that this is what D&amp;D would have been if it were designed by lawyers instead of wargame enthusiasts? :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon" title="JBMannon"><img alt="JBMannon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon">JBMannon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296864/#Comment_296864" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-14T10:26:00+00:00" title="October 14, 2010 10:26AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have been thinking about the role of lawyers in a setting like this.

I think the more clauses in the rule, the more powerful but limited (focused if you will) it should be.  Broad rules are easily superseded by exception rules made by other people.  <br/><br/>Given the limitations of rules, if something important were at stake, many rulers might work together to make it so.  Say there were a doomsday device.  Part of the rulers' status might come from the fact that they all hold a single rule in place to protect it - the effect being a massive and impenetrable web of redundant rules that prevent its use.<br/><br/>As for mechanics, check out the board game Yspahan.  It has a dice mechanic where a player rolls all the dice, places all the lowest number rolled at the bottom of a scale, all the highest at the top on the scale, and then work up from the bottom.  The effect is that the next-to-highest spot on the scale only gets dice if all numbers are rolled.  In Yspahan's case there are, I think, 8d6 spread across a 6-point scale each round(e.g. 111, 2, 4 4, nothing, nothing, 5 5).  Players then choose all the dice from one point on the scale and the number of dice equals the number of times you can take associated actions.  I could see something working like this where you, get this, roll 15d12 and place them up against a, get this, 12 inch ruler.  You could then play with the number of dice in the 12 slot, the number of slots with dice in them, etc. to determine the power of a rule, the number of clauses, number of words, duration, etc.<br/><br/>What if rulers were excluded from the nobility and the people relied on the nobility to mediate with the rulers (the people are afraid of the rulers and the nobles got to be nobles via a tradition of being good negotiators).<br/><br/>As for the rules, read Preacher, a comic where the protagonist has the "word of god" and his words are always true or come true or have to happen.  See places where his words are taken too literally - think djinn. <br/><br/>What happens if two people make contradictory rules at the same time?  Would this rend a hole in space-time?  Is this a horrific idea or a common tactic to create wormholes?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296925/#Comment_296925" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-14T15:16:03+00:00" title="October 14, 2010  3:16PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm definitely taking a closer look at Mortal Coil, yeah.

What I came up with is this: (very basic) when you want to create a rule you must decide on the rules length (how long it will be active), breadth (how far reaching the rule will be), intended target (one person, many people, a certain subset of people). Each level of the rule does two things 1) it modifies difficulty, 2) it determines the color of dice that you use. How many words your rule is and your word choices will also modify the difficulty. Your skill at ruling will determine how many dice you roll and you must take at least one of each of the corrisponding colors. You can never take more than one more of any particular color more than the other colors. <br/><br/>Advancing your ruling skill would require that you have rolled a number of each of the colors of dice equal to your curent skill. Doing so means that players will be looking for oppertunities to make rulings of varying difficulty and scale. This does not take into account success or failure but simply attemts. The system could be applied to all skills (exploring rules, breaking rules, remembering rules, ect) all that would need to be changed is the parameters to better fit what the character is doing. <br/><br/>Let me know what you think!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297081/#Comment_297081" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-16T05:44:26+00:00" title="October 16, 2010  5:44AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 16, 2010 5:45AM by DanielSolis.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ran a quick scenario with my wife last night using the following system (which I've been tinkering on for other projects, but used here as a simple experiment):\n<blockquote>You have 4d6. Two dice are red. Two dice are blue.<br/>On your turn, state your character's action, then roll all four dice.<br/><br/>Only keep two of those dice, to create a sum of 2-12.<br/>A lower result means that your action is not allowed according to the rules in this place.<br/>A higher result means that your action is allowed, according to the rules in this place.<br/>Either way, you may want to make note of the rules as you discover them.<br/>Use caution. Trying to disobey the rules once or twice may be excused as ignorance, but frequent attempts are signs of aggressive disobedience.<br/><br/>As for the colors...<br/>If you keep BB, that means your employer is very pleased about this rule.<br/>If you keep BR (where B is greater than R), your employer is somewhat pleased about this rule.<br/>If you keep a tied BR, your employer has no interest in this rule.<br/>If you keep RB (where R is greater than <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/>, your employer is somewhat displeased about this rule.<br/>If you keep RR, that means your employer is very displeased about this rule.</blockquote>\nMy wife Megan played a cleric, out in the DMZ that we've been discussing earlier in the thread. She is employed by a king to map the rules of this region for future conquest. The cleric had no stats because I'm not interested in stats at this point, just the system and choices.\n<blockquote>GM: You walk along a gravel road until you come upon an old stone fortress nestled in the brambles. What do you do?<br/><br/>Megan: I approach the fortress openly, waving my right arm.<br/><br/><i>Roll. B4 B5 R2 R6. She keeps BB, for a total of 9. This is allowed and this pleases her employer.</i><br/><br/>GM: You are allowed to approach and are greeted\u2026 well, ignored\u2026 by a man who has been laying in the grass. He seems to be enjoying the afternoon sun.<br/><br/>Megan: I step towards this man, again showing with right arm exposed and obviously not wielding a weapon. "Excuse me, sir. Do you know the name of this fortress?"<br/><br/><i>Roll. B1 B5 R3 R6. She keeps BB, for a total of 6. This is allowed and this pleases her employer.</i><br/><br/>GM: The man pays little notice to you and responds in a gruff, smelly voice: "Who's askin'?"<br/><br/>Megan: I respond, "I am a traveling storyteller, singing of my travels through this region and sharing the stories."<br/><br/><i>Roll. B1 B4 R5 R6. She keeps BB, for a total of 4. This is a pretty low result, but not too bad. Something she just said or did is a minor infraction, but she still wants to please her employer.</i><br/><br/>GM: The man stands straight up at the mention of "storyteller." He shakes the grass off his shoulders, but never breaks eye contact. He says: "Listen, friend. I don't know where you come from but we don't do no singin' nor tellin' of no tales inside those walls. Now, my memory's bad, so lemme ask again. Who are you?"<br/><br/>Megan: I respond, "Did I say storyteller? Ha! Sorry, my English isn't so good. What's the word\u2026 ah\u2026 Journalist. Yes. I am a journalist, documenting current events around this region for the good of all unaligned townsfolk. I see you have no banner on your fortress, so surely you're in need of some new news from beyond your city limits."<br/><br/><i>Roll. B1 B1 R6 R6. She keeps RR, for a total of 12. This will greatly displease her employer, but Megan can do her employer no good if she is thrown into jail.</i><br/><br/>GM: The man wipes the dirt from his eyes with a clean patch of his sleeve. "Ah, a journalist! Yes, we have such need of your services!" He escorts you into the fortress. "Tell me, what news comes from the war in Shiloh? Whatever happened to the Geldish baby trapped in the well? What are the latest fashions of the north\u2026"</blockquote>\nThe way this scenario turned out, it was definitely more about culture shock and navigating unknown rules of conduct. The slightest action could be gravely offensive or highly lauded. That sort of game reminds me of this <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_18603_the-6-worst-parts-being-chinese-not-in-stereotypes_p2.html" rel="nofollow">Cracked</a> article on Keqi:<br/><br/>"[...]a sort of system of being polite. But it's less about being polite to people because you don't want to hurt their feelings and more about being polite so you don't look bad. Keqi overload can lead to ridiculous situations where you end up going to a restaurant nobody wanted to go to because nobody wanted to look selfish by going to the restaurant they wanted if nobody else wanted it. So you go to a restaurant everyone hates to satisfy everyone."<br/><br/>That's a kind of fun, because you're not just discovering things about the region you're in, but you're also discovering things that your employer likes or dislikes. With no prep at all, you can randomly generate a town and a personality for your employer at the same time, through play.<br/><br/>Of course, this scenario had no active ruling taking place. That's probably the next step.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297343/#Comment_297343" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-19T07:04:47+00:00" title="October 19, 2010  7:04AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 19, 2010 7:05AM by DanielSolis.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I think I have a handle on how to design a game based on exploring the DMZ, but that kind of seems like well-tread ground. Either it's about exploring new places and getting trouble, which is somewhat D&amp;Dish, or about first contact and culture shock, which seems covered by <i>Sign-In Stranger</i> and <i>Shock</i>. That's not a problem in and of itself, though. The DMZ seems like the place where players can find the most room to set up new rules, stake their own claims, and have an open sandbox.<br/><br/>Still, I'd like to see some way to play within the existing courts and kingdoms somehow. My gut says not to turn to randomized systems, at least not at first, but instead to create some kind of diplomatic system. Halfway between <i>Baron Munchausen</i>, <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, and <i>Polaris</i>. A way of speaking at the table that flows naturally, but still has the feel of tense formality, with mechanical effects depending on how you the conversation flows.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348653/#Comment_348653" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-11T04:15:09+00:00" title="November 11, 2011  4:15AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So over a year later, I think I'm settled on a situation for this setting. The king's sons and daughters are suddenly exiled, cut off from the line of succession, and cast out into the unruled zone between kingdoms. <br/><br/>How will these pampered royals adapt without modern comforts? Which subjects came along with them? Why did the King exile them? What will they do? Will they build their own kingdom? Will they return to their father's homeland? Will they find allies in an around the kingdom? If they turn against their father, who will survive?<br/><br/>In short, the whole group is a bunch of Prince Zukos. I can see this an easy avenue to introduce many aspects of the setting: The monarchy, the subjects, ruling, family politics, and exploration of the wildlands.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356900/#Comment_356900" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-31T06:24:11+00:00" title="January 31, 2012  6:24AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just posted a <a href="http://danielsolisblog.blogspot.com/2012/01/in-lab-rulers-system-overview.html" rel="nofollow">system overview</a>, with a slight tweak to the situation: The PCs are still exiled Rulers, but the exile is televised and broadcast like Hunger Games.
