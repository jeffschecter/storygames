Find it on Amazon.com and our website (and soon IPR and DriveThruRPG)<br/><br/>For those of you who haven't heard of Forsooth!, it's a Shakespeare-themed RPG (Yes, it's a product of Game Chef 2011 -- Yes, it won the competition, so you know it's good). It's rules light, promotes over-the-top improvisation, and lets each player control a small cast made up of 2-3 characters. It's been described as "a Shakespearean <i>Fiasco </i>with a less messy setup," which I take as a high compliment.<br/><br/>OK, so you're interested and want to learn more about the game? Here's all the Forsooth! resources, all in one place!<br/><br/>The <a href="http://bit.ly/NWdvK5" rel="nofollow">interview from Hyperbole Games</a> -- very in-depth, talks in detail about how the game was designed and how it works.<br/><br/>The first content preview: <a href="http://bit.ly/KBopXk" rel="nofollow">Death</a> -- violence, ghosts, and bloody murder, and the closest thing the game has to a combat system.<br/><br/>The game debuted early at <a href="http://jiffycon.blogspot.com/2012/05/jiffycon-boston-june-16-somerville-ma.html" rel="nofollow">Jiffycon Boston</a> this past Saturday, and it was a rousing success!<br/><br/>Watch this space for further updates, and as the Bard once wrote, "Much, much more!*"<br/><br/>*Seriously, it was in <i>Merchant of Venice</i>. Yes, this is slightly out of context. OK, totally out of context.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sliberty" title="Sliberty"><img alt="Sliberty" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sliberty">Sliberty</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382043/#Comment_382043" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-12T09:35:15+00:00" title="June 12, 2012  9:35AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2012 9:53AM by Sliberty.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><i>Mark how well the sequel hangs together: Eleven hours I have spent to write it over.\u201d \u2013 Richard III, Act III, Scene 6 </i><br/><br/>Let\u2019s say you\u2019ve just won Game Chef.

This one is pretty special: a rare, and possible apocryphal play from a lost tome of Shakespeare known as the Fifth Folio. <br/><br/><a href="http://spoiledflushgames.com/forsooth-preview-hamlet/" rel="nofollow">Hamlet, King of Denmark.</a><br/><br/>Fed up with the groundlings\u2019 complaints that Prince Hamlet was too indecisive, contemplative, and otherwise lily-livered, Shakespeare wrote an alternate version in which the Prince\u2019s madness is no act \u2014 he\u2019s actually just crazy, and when his dead dad tells him of Claudius\u2019 crimes, he decides to just take his word for it. By the end of Act I, Hamlet has tied Claudius and Getrude down and set their bedchamber on fire, killing them. A terrified palace crowns Hamlet king.<br/><br/>Also included: a complete sample cast, one of five included with the book.<br/><br/><br/>In other news, we took Forsooth! to JiffyCon Boston yesterday, and had a great time. I may type up a little report later today to summarize my JiffyCon experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Idler_King" title="Idler_King"><img alt="Idler_King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Idler_King">Idler_King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382881/#Comment_382881" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-20T09:41:46+00:00" title="June 20, 2012  9:41AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Sam, this is Will from your JiffyCon game.

Thinking back on it, I realized how important the Oaths were for helping us create the appropriately dramatic atmosphere. The things that Zeke pulled out for his Drunk to keep from doing work pulled us all into crazy schemes and made openings for betrayals and reversals. <br/><br/>Well done, and congratulations on taking it all the way! There have been many games that have gone the distance from Iron Game Chef, but few winners. Bravo to you.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sliberty" title="Sliberty"><img alt="Sliberty" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sliberty">Sliberty</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382887/#Comment_382887" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-20T10:55:25+00:00" title="June 20, 2012 10:55AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 20, 2012 10:57AM by Sliberty.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're thinking of Hortence and Sheffield!<br/><br/>Lucy was the miller's daughter who wanted to be a priest.<br/><br/>To be honest, my protagonist (Governor Coole) wasn't married either, but I didn't let that stop the game from ending. On the one hand, I probably should have made Jane my protagonist. In fact I did, but changed it to Coole during cast generation.<br/><br/>On the other hand, in the Cycles rules, there's a mechanic called "Destiny" which lets you end a play without being married or dead, that we probably would have been using if it wasn't at a Con.<br/><br/>Overall, I don't mind that the wrong folks got married and died, because it was still really fun.<br/><br/>The more I think about that session, the more it tickles me. Everyone did an incredible job, from Act I, Scene i on. It was packed with great moments of drama and tons of hilarious antics. Tom and Lucy were understated characters, but always knew exactly what to say. I really love characters like that.<br/><br/>Thanks for the kind words about Forsooth!, Emily. I'm so glad everyone enjoyed it, and your approval is high praise indeed!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383004/#Comment_383004" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-21T14:30:29+00:00" title="June 21, 2012  2:30PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha!

Makes Its Entrance</b><br/><i>Spoiled Flush Games releases Shakespearean RPG</i><br/><br/><i>BOSTON, Mass., July 22, 2012</i> \u2013 The ultimate Shakespeare RPG made its stunning debut today, to thunderous applause from groundlings everywhere. Spoiled Flush Games today released Forsooth!, the hotly-anticipated, expanded version of the Game Chef-winning game of the same name. Forsooth! is an innovative, new story game that blends high drama with improv comedy.  If you love theatre, or literature, or being a complete ham for the amusement of your friends, this game is for you.<br/><br/>\u201cWe wanted to make a simple, fun game that any Shakespeare fan could pick up and play, a game that really captured the essence of what made the bard so awesome,\u201d says co-creator Kevin Spak. \u201cAnd that meant making possibly the most role-playing intensive, game ever.\u201d<br/><br/>Forsooth! challenges three-to-six players to improvise one of Shakespeare\u2019s greatest lost works. There\u2019s no need for a game master, no need to prepare anything in advance, and the rules take just minutes to learn. From cast generation to curtain call, a game lasts around two or three hours, and a handy Cliff Notes edition allows for even faster game play \u2013 right around 90 comedy-or-drama-packed minutes.<br/><br/>\u201cAt its heart, Forsooth! is an improv game,\u201d explains co-creator Sam Liberty. \u201cBut we wanted to layer a little strategy on top of that. So we\u2019ve introduced a number of mechanics, like soliloquies and asides, that let the players change their characters\u2019 fates and improve their position for the final curtain call.\u201d<br/><br/>Forsooth! was previewed at Jiffycon Boston last week to rave reviews. \u201cThis is a game that uses its source material, not just as props, but as an integral living breathing part of the experience,\u201d said Zeke Russell of the Brilliant Gameologists podcast. \u201cIts rules are clever and engaging and allow you to do some wonderful silly stuff, while still moving play forward.\u201d<br/><br/>Print copies of Forsooth! are available for $14 on Amazon.com, and through SpoiledFlushGames.com. It will also soon be available at select brick and mortar stores, and from Indie Press Revolution. Look for PDF copies there as well, and at DriveThruRPG.com, for $10 each.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
