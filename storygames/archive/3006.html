And Martin Scorsese.<br/><br/>I found myself saying this, elsewhere:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judson Lester</cite>As a GM I try to present my players with tricky decisions for their characters.  E.g., "to get what you want, would you rather work really hard, or put an acquaintance in harms way?"  And then I set up further choices as the consequences of the earlier choices: "will you put yourself in decided jeopardy to rescue to person you put in danger?"  On reflection, I guess those are bangs, with the possible component that there's an evaluation going on in the back of my head about characters based on the decisions they make.</blockquote>\nAnd this is something I've sort of realized for quite some time, and I'm not sure how useful it is.  Everything that makes sense to me in theory of all stripes is just someone documenting a technique or observation that I've used for years without giving it a name.  I mean, I was framing scenes, and pushing for interesting conflict and making bangs, and noticing that some games have more points of contact than others, way before I'd heard of any of them.  Not to say there wasn't room for improvement; there's a difference between what we intuit and what we learn.<br/><br/>But to a certain degree I feel like I found out that the secret of the flying carpet is not to imagine a purple elephant.  When I'm thinking about specific theory, and using it the context of a game, the game hops along, and it drags a bit.  Sometimes, when I make an effort, I find myself vaguely aware that "hey, I'm framing a scene!" and the framing that occurs is very much better than whenever I start from "Okay, so I need to frame the next scene."<br/><br/>Which led me to the title of the discussion here: <i>Return to the Valley of the Dolls.</i>  Roger Ebert is a widely respected film critic, but not such a great film maker.  <br/><br/>And that's as far as the thought took me.  Am I striking any chords here, or shouting in the wilderness?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markv" title="markv"><img alt="markv" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markv">markv</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68507/#Comment_68507" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-11T11:44:41+00:00" title="May 11, 2007 11:44AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "It's Judson's game, and it Freaks him out!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68544/#Comment_68544" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-11T13:44:35+00:00" title="May 11, 2007  1:44PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds very right. <br/><br/>There are many things that I do as a GM that I'm getting names for, ways to pass on to others, and ways to use consciously from my time talking theory. Tony's thing about pause button chips, which I turned into a soundtrack thing, is something that I've always done in my intuitive manner that is now conscious and spread around the table rather than just centered in my own intuitive sense. Scene framing is something I always did, that I do better now because I learned to recognize it as its own thing. And so on. <br/><br/>But when I'm thinking about a theory thing in the moment of game, like "I need to address premise here" it will suck every time. The theory is like a koan or an exercise, a sport or kata for the actual combat of play. If I use it to analyze and improve what I do outside the moment it can be helpful, but if I'm thinking about it as I go, it sucks. <br/><br/>I'm not always sure how much of this is the dreaded theory kill and how much of it is the millipede effect. Some things that I did change, things I didn't always do, were hard and sucked at first but now are smooth and easy. So there may be a bit of both.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68558/#Comment_68558" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-11T14:07:14+00:00" title="May 11, 2007  2:07PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is lately been cropping up and annoying me, yeah.  There's this sense that Theory should guide Play, which I think is really wrong-headed and bound for creating crap play.  If you're playing, you really shouldn't be thinking theory; it gets in the way.  Instead, Play should guide Theory, and Theory should guide Design; Design should guide Play.  This prevents the millipede effect because when you're playing, you're just following rules and procedures.  Those rules and procedures may have been designed according to theoretical underpinnings, but you don't have to think about the underpinnings in order to play.  All you have to do is follow directions, which frees up most of your brain to enjoy playing.<br/><br/>(Judson, I introduced a triangle; forgive me!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68565/#Comment_68565" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-11T14:33:06+00:00" title="May 11, 2007  2:33PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fucking Illuminatus bastard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68567/#Comment_68567" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-11T14:38:38+00:00" title="May 11, 2007  2:38PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In improv, one of the worst things you can do on stage is to be "in your head," that is, to be thinking about what you should be doing, instead of being in the scene actually doing something.

Just as a general observation, I like agreeing with you at times and I like disagreeing wtih you the rest of the time. Anyways,<br/><br/>I think that introducing theory jargon into a text is bad, sure. But, I would only call it theory jargon if it is bringing in outside concepts. If you develop the concept within the text (ie, explain how to initiate a scene, how to frame, etc) and give it a name and tell people to do it, it is more like a technique being taught than a jargon word being dropped.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68778/#Comment_68778" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-13T10:03:36+00:00" title="May 13, 2007 10:03AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &lt;&lt;blockquote&gt;<cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Instead, Play should guide Theory, and Theory should guide Design; Design should guide Play. <br/><br/>I can see how design (procedures and methods) guides play, but what about the role of training exercises?

Do many martial arts have a body of explicit theory from which techniques and exercises are derived? Tai Chi perhaps, to an extent, in that it's based on Daoist  philosophy and metaphysics.) <br/><br/>Does anyone do explicit training exercises related to rolegames? I don't remember seeing anyone claim to do training exercises as such, but it's commonly suggested that newcomers to Forge-inspired games play DitV or The Pool first, with the rationale being that those games have 'training wheels' that prevent people slipping back into traditional play styles.<br/><br/>Any others? I know that actors do all kinds of things (e.g. the exercise when you're only allowed to use a single word, thereby forcing you to practice other avenues of expression such as voice tone and body language).<br/><br/>The thought does occur that rolegames are primarily practiced as an entertainment, not as a competive sport or as a performing art.

(TonyLB had a few that were a lot of fun though.) <br/><br/>Mostly these days I play one-shots or short games with a particular goal and focus in order to highlight a particular skill. I also play games that have mechanics that force me to work a particular muscle (like Capes for competition, Dogs for escalation, etc) in order to get that skill a workout where the whole group is looking at it and working on it together. Of course, I don't usually explain it to my group in those terms, its more like a "hey, why don't we try this thing and see if it works."<br/><br/>Really though, odd as it may sound, a lot of my "training" for RPGs comes from outside RPGs. Writing, acting, study of various academic subjects... these things build a lot of the skills that I use in RPGs. The things I do with theory (address premise, bitch) and game exercises thus tend to be less about developing an ability and more about using an already developed ability in a game context.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68849/#Comment_68849" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T06:13:44+00:00" title="May 14, 2007  6:13AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "If you put theory jargon in your game (not only are you handwaving what should be actual procedure) but you're forcing your audience to be in their heads when they should be playing the game."<br/>\n<br/>\nYep. I don't know how many times I've said this to people. In fact, I've gone so far as to say that one should not talk theory even outside of play with their game group. In addition to the problems you cite, it just tends to make people defensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mostly agree that the process should be like Brand has it. That said, I think that for a GM who understands theory, there's room to use it for self-reflection. Am I providing enough Bangs for my players? That's an easier question to go over in your head if you have a clear definition of what a bang is (it is for me, at least). And then in terms of preparation, it's easier me to head to a goal if I have some definition of it (even if I then bend the definition).<br/>\n<br/>\nFurther I think it's good for teaching technique. Once the term Bang is defined, then we can move on to techniques for producing them for instance, without having to explain what one is every time we give a technique designed to produce them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I do think that these terms have a lot of use to them outside of play or direct play feedback with other players. But, yeah I completely agree that once you get going you should "just play" as it were. That's what works for me, anyhow.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68855/#Comment_68855" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T06:58:47+00:00" title="May 14, 2007  6:58AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judson Lester</cite>Which led me to the title of the discussion here:<i>[Beyond] the Valley of the Dolls.</i>Roger Ebert is a widely respected film critic, but not such a great film maker.</blockquote>\nI'm going to nitpick---Your example/analogy here is misleading and/or unfair. To begin with, "Beyond" was written early in Ebert's career, 7-8 years (at least) before he was awarded his Pulitzer Prize for criticism. But more importantly, Ebert only co-wrote the script. The driving creative force was clearly the director (Meyer?). So you can't "blame" Ebert for the way the film turned out (though he had a part in it). It's also highly questionable whether, if Ebert decided to write another script today (some 40 years later), if it would turn out as badly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68947/#Comment_68947" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T10:41:22+00:00" title="May 14, 2007 10:41AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The value of an analogy is not in it's truthfulness, but how it explicates the analogous phenomenon, Tim.

Techniques are procedures used in play to produce certain effects.<br><br>People have been using techniques for as long as there's been role-playing. I think people that have been labeled as great GMs or great players are people who happen to have developed a very strong collection of effective techniques.<br><br>From the beginning, some techniques have been hard coded in written games, like ways for handling combat between players' characters and monsters. These techniques were mechanics. Other techniques, while just as important, tended not to be recorded. I'm talking about stuff like creating and playing an effective and vibrant villain, or the best point to start or end a scene. That stuff was developed individually and passed from one person to another experientially.<br><br>And you really have to play with different groups to get a sense of how differently they do this stuff. That was one of the only ways to learn new techniques, short of developing them yourself. Of course, many techniques were lifted from other places, like creative writing and improv. Also, these techniques were highly portable. It was relatively easy to take a technique learned from one group and introduce it to another group. Each role-playing group had a particular style made up in large part by the collection of techniques it had at its disposal. And yet, though techniques were highly portable, good techniques didn't necessarily spread very far once the hobby got larger. It just wasn't feasible..<br><br>One of the things that the early indie games associated with The Forge did that really made them special was that they took techniques that the designers had developed or used, like Bangs, Relationship Maps, Kickers, Scene Framing, Say Yes or Roll Dice, Let It Ride, etc., and wrapped them into the mechanics. They were now as hard coded in the mechanics of the game as stuff like combat rules.<br><br>We can leave figuring how and why these things work to theory. <br><br>Regardless, wrapping the techniques in mechanics had some interesting effects. Many of these effects were beneficial, some where problematic, especially in relation to groups with an existing array of techniques and little desire to adopt new ones. One of the most important effects was that we started giving these techniques names and so were able to discuss them. Bangs made their appearance as a technique in Sorcerer, but players were able to recognize their utility in a wider context, and they became a tool used in many games, whether as a mechanical element or not.<br/><br/>One of the really interesting effects had to do with the portability of techniques. Prior to these games, such techniques were almost entirely optional. But with these new games, if you didn't know or weren't comfortable with a particular technique used, you couldn't excise it without making the game play very differently from how it was supposed to work. Sorcerer, as a game, doesn't do what Sorcerer was written to do if you don't use Kickers and Bangs. The economy of Burning Wheel gets destroyed if you don't use Let It Ride. So in the context of the games that specifically use them, particular techniques were no longer really optional.<br/><br/>That's a very long wind up to get to my core point: One of the things that's interesting about these types of techniques is that unlike the first type of techniques, these are skills. It's not just about knowing them and applying them. It requires practice to develop facility and early efforts are likely to be clumsy and awkward.<br/><br/>For the most part, I think the old adage, "If ain't broke, don't fix it," holds true. If you're already using tight Scene Framing (for instance), there's no reason to worry about it consciously, really. But there are a lot of folks out there that haven't used that technique before. And I think there are also folks who maybe have used such techniques without thinking about it, but now want to hone their skills.<br/><br/>And taking an unconscious practice, a talent, and doing it consciously often means a period of awkwardness. You see it in sports all the time. You'll see a baseball player who slugs the ball or a golfer who can really place it. And then, for whatever reason, in an attempt to bring new weapons to the game they start working on their swings. All of a sudden they can't hit the ball worth a damn. They're focusing consciously on the swing to the point that the movement is unnatural and awkward. But with effort and practice the new swing can become second nature.<br/><br/>It's the same thing with role-playing techniques. Once you've mastered them to the point that they're second nature, you can just play. But it often requires work to get to that point.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68998/#Comment_68998" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T14:10:30+00:00" title="May 14, 2007  2:10PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I recognized Bangs, for instance, the moment I saw them. And I was like... gee, I've done that several times... in my 20+ years of play. Once I identified that this technique was really the sort of thing that was making my game good when it happened - and also that I was allowed to angle for it if I did it correctly (there were times when I felt like, and probably was, hosing my players instead) - I started doing it multiple times per session, not just once every couple of years.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not just identifying the technique, but disecting it, and figuring out why it works. Because then you can figure out if there are bad versions, or just better ways of doing the technique in question. With bangs, for instance, there are some very good tools that one can develop to identify them in terms of writing them up for prep. And then what's more, I find myself being able to discover them zen-like in play far, far more easily than I did previously.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I'm not exaggerating when I say that I was a pretty lousy GM before I learned my theory. I would blame my players for lack of interest in play, when I can see now just how I was draining all the fun out of play for them in many ways. I'm not particularly good at narration, and can't keep people's attention that way. But using technique that I've learned through applied theory, I've managed to make up for my shortcomings to where I think I run a reasonably fun game.

So, I hope I can clear up what I think is a misunderstanding and elicit an apology.<br/><br/>What I'm specifically saying is that my experience in actual play has been that whenever I've seen jargon used at a table - more generally, that players were concretely thinking about theory at the table - it's hurt play.  Anything from large scale "I was thinking something more Narrative than that" to (and most damaging, in my opinion) "okay, you frame the next scene" all have had a negative impact on play.<br/><br/>I firmly believe (and it's also my experience) that analysis of role playing as an artistic form and developing theory is useful to producing better play.  I do think it's useful (and it has been useful to me) to think and talk about agenda, about ideas like scene framing, drama vs. karma, and all of that.  <br/><br/>I think it's worth developing the skills in exercises, and I certainly think it's worthwhile to design with a grounding in theory.  I honestly don't understand how you could argue that theory would detract from game design in any way.<br/><br/>The analogy to <i>Beyond the Valley of the Dolls</i> was a reference to the (apparently apocryphal) conventional wisdom that Roger Ebert is a rotten director because he's a skilled critic: that you can't think critically and creatively at the same time.  <br/><br/>Concrete example: "You, frame the next scene" doesn't work nearly as well in my experience as "Where do you go next?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69116/#Comment_69116" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T00:04:47+00:00" title="May 15, 2007 12:04AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>HEY!

But that would be dick, so: <br/><br/>And maybe this is where I start to erode my own position, but specifically, as a procedure "frame the next scene" is terribly vague.  Can I say "Now that we've successfully bought groceries, now we're in a basement, I've got a chainsaw, and you're on the Jacob's cross."?  For purposes of theory discussion, it's fine.  I can say "I framed a scene (too loosely/very aggressively/with a chainsaw and bondage equipment)" the same way I can say "I ran a combat (with Orcs/doubletime/by the book)."  <br/><br/>So, on the one hand, use of jargon in a rulestext might only be a case of insufficient unpacking.  If the fantasy heartbreaker I picked up instructed the GM, at certain points in play to "run combat" without detailing a procedure for doing that, I'd be let down.<br/><br/>Excuse me while I divert from my original course, because this is just occurring to me:<br/><br/>In games where there aren't procedural instructions that read "frame the next scene," I frame scenes.  But it's a process.  It often starts with a pull: "what do you do next?"  (Or "Did you want to do anything before then?") and then there's some give and take, of suggesting scenery and an event etc.  And if I had to write down What To Do to Frame A Scene, there'd be at least 3 steps.  (And they wouldn't be universal across games or rule sets.)  <br/><br/>I've been watching the whole dozen-thread kerfuffle about "please don't use jargon here, it hurts me!" and been awfully surprised that no one has pointed out the utility of thinking that jargon represents.  Apart from "all packaged up, I can swing Nar around in conversation in three letters" is the fact that you can swing it around in your head in three letters, and that's far more important.  <br/><br/><strong>But,</strong> it's tempting as a result, as a player and as a rule-writer, to forget that the package and it's contents aren't really identical.  There's still an elephant in packages as small as "scene framing."  And there's only one way to eat an elephant.<br/><br/>And, I'll daresay that's a big part of why I liked <i>Shooting the Moon</i> better than <i>Shock:</i>: because Hurdles and Responses, and Suggestions and Conflicts are a way of unpacking what <i>Shock:</i> has you toss together in one conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69458/#Comment_69458" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T20:22:38+00:00" title="May 15, 2007  8:22PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oooooooooooh.
