It was generally very good. I'm hoping you have more good stuff to say in response to my reactions.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>(For the purposes of Solar System, an ostensibly universal system, all campaigns have a genre - it might be more or less realistic, but we never lose sight of the fact that we're making a story.)</blockquote>\nNot all games should put focus on "making a story." I know you didn't say otherwise. I'm wearing my personal "trad-gamer" hat and just reacting. In some types of games, having the players examine the sausage-making process is ruinous, yes?<br/>\n<blockquote>An example I use in the text is about when a player character is wandering alone in the woods after killing his brother's wife: insofar as it would not seem hopelessly contrived, the SG would be expected to continue the game by framing a scene where the character stumbles on a hermitage, some faeries, a king's reeve or perhaps his brother</blockquote>\nIf I am wearing my trad-gamer hat, most of those choices would annoy me, ala "Lost." Unless there was some good world-simulation justification for them, then I'm magically OK with exactly the same sort of outcome.\n<blockquote>Even in the most raw, ugly realistic genre we would still skip over the part where the character wanders around for days, meets some cowherds, recuperates in their humble cottage for a month and then returns to the city to clear his name; we'd just note that this was what happened and frame directly into the next scene that actually matters for the story.</blockquote>\nMostly agreed. Excise "for the story" and I totally agree. We're skipping it not "for the story" but because nobody wants to engage with that particular slice. If the player had something he wanted to do in lost-wood scene, we're back in.<br/>\n<blockquote>Also: I hate "whose vision of the story willl we go with". I don't find that interesting at all myself. Luckily it's very rare outside rought drafts, and it seems that not many games like that get much traction.<i>Houses of the Blooded</i>comes to mind, mainly.</blockquote>\nI have now played 6 games of Zombie Cinema. I would describe the central mechanism as "whose vision of the story will we go with." Please discuss and possibly disabuse me of that notion.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
