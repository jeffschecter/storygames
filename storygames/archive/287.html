                    I'm currently playtesting a game I've written (it's called "Heist", it's about robbing places and it's designed to be played with cards in a pub with a minimum of equipment).<br/>
<br/>
Could some of you who are used to playtesting give me tips and techniques for making it effective? For example, do you play to break the game or do you try to make it a normal gaming session? Do you change any rules that don't seem to work or do you persevere? If everyone's bored, do you give up?<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, I keep things very informal: we go the pub, we play the game. If the person I'm playing with looks bored, I skip over the section that's boring them and we move on. If rules don't work, we rewrite them on the fly. At the end, I ask which bits they enjoyed and which they didn't.<br/>
<br/>
Don't just concentrate on my playtesting, though. If you've discovered any strategies for making playtesting work, tell me them.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<p>In my experience, players (including the GM) who <em>know</em> that the rules can be changed on the fly do not put much mental energy into seeing how to apply rules in ways that aren't obvious.  Likewise, players whose intent is to break the system.</p>
<p>My best results come when I say "We're going to use the rules as written.  We're not changing them.  We're going to try to play a game, and if it doesn't work we'll just quit and play something else.  Observations about how the rules could be <em>better</em> are incredibly valuable but will <em>not</em> be folded in to the playing of this session."</p>
<p>That way, people will say "Y'know, it would be nice if there were a Rule Z that let me do this particular thing.  I guess, since there isn't, I can use rules A, E and Q in combination to achieve the same thing," which lets you know that rules A, E and Q synergize in ways that people find useful.</p>

                            Graham, it sounds like you're doing a good job.  I don't think there is any formula.  <br/><br/>Playing hard with the deliberate goal of breaking the game is useful.  In this mode you'll be stopping and re-starting often.  It takes dedicated testers because it isn't that much fun.  But it is <em>gold.</em><br/><br/>Playing fun with the deliberate goal of having a good time is also useful.  In this mode you'll be throwing stuff out and re-writing on the fly.  Try to keep track of the stuff that got hand-waved or tossed out, because chances are you can ruthlessly purge it instead of re-tooling it.<br/><br/>My main suggestion would be to gather as much intelligence as you can - ask your players what worked and what did not, and what they expected but did not see and vice-versa.  Writing up an actual play post immediately after a session is a great way of preserving knowledge.  It's so easy to forget and there's nothing worse than repeating an obvious and noted mistake in a later playtest.  I actually <em> forgot the rules of my game</em>at a convention last year.  We played wrong and that was a session wasted, in terms of playtest value.<br/><br/>Another suggestion - get your game out there.  Play it with people you don't know, or let others play it without you being involved (if you can observe, that's fantastic).    Actual play feedback from strangers (or distant friends) is always super useful.  Take it to conventions, which are a cauldron of insane strangers who will break your game for you.                        </div>

                            Heya,<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, Tony's right.  Each time you playtest, you playtest the rules as written.  Then you take notes as you play.   Based on your notes, you revise.  Then you play the revised version as written.  Changing things on the fly A) doesn't give the rule enough time to be used propperly and B) creates an invalid test, IMO, because you're changing the variables in the middle of the experiement.  It's kind of a pain, but it's the best way to do it IMHO.  I think it also might be why people hate it so much ;-D<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

                            The other thing, is that once you move your game from "just playtesting for yourself" and before "publish!", you want to see if others will playtest your game.  Make sure that you get people who aren't just cooperative hippies, who will solidly play your game, but also find problems with it. That way you'll know if the game will work for Regular Folks, too.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Personally, it depends on what stage the game is at. When it's at bundle-of-notes-that-only-I-can-decipher stage, I tend to be much more open to just changing stuff on the fly, and then seeing how that integrates with what I actually have written. During this stage, I often find that I'll do stuff in play, then see that I never wrote that stuff down, but I should have.<br/>
<br/>
When its at send-it-out-to-other-people stage, I'm a fan of playing it as written and seeing what happens. If something glaring comes up, or there's a known issue that I just want to poke at a little more to see if it's really an issue, and I have an idea of how to change it, I'll do that in the middle of the game, but for more minor stuff I take notes and revise later. Case in point - with Carry, I was unsure about the Endgame trigger mechanics, and I got a playtest report that said that it was a problem for them, so when they became a problem for me in my playtest I went ahead and changed them.<br/>
<br/>
I'm really bad at playing-to-break, though. Really bad.                        </div>

That's a good question, actually. I'm towards the end of the scribbled-in-a-pad stage. So the rules are rather nicely written in a pad. In other words, I have a set of rules which are enough to play the whole game, but they're still changeable. <br/>
<br/>
And, yes, of course, that means that informal playtesting could be very helpful. Later on, perhaps I'll need something more formal.<br/>
<br/>
Colin,<br/>
<br/>
Can't think of a funny reply right now.<br/>
<br/>
The pub part is important, though. It's meant to be a game that you can play with very little preparation: in other words, you're sitting in the pub, you decide spontaneously to play, and you pull out cards and begin playing.<br/>
<br/>
All that has an effect on the playtesting, of course. I've been suggesting playing the game when I'm in the pub, without any preparation, to see if the "spontaneous" thing works.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone else,<br/>
<br/>
Those are excellent tips. Thank you. Do feel free to use this thread as a dumping ground for any playtesting hints and tips: they're helping a lot.<br/>

                            I agree with Tony about the value of playing sessions with the rules as written. Make adjustments between sessions. Also, get folks to <i>write down</i> what they liked, disliked, and didn't care about. Set an example with simple lists - one entry for each category is better than nothing, and as they get into the habit, many will supply more details. And make sure that playtest sessions go on where you the creator aren't present at all.                        </div>

Oh...good question.<br/>

How it works at the moment is: If you lose a conflict, you buy the next round, if anyone has finished their drink.<br/>
<br/>
Not of bloody lager, though. Lager drinkers are banned from playing this game.<br/>

                            Hey, :)<br>
<br>
Recently, we did playtesting for Project Senate by taking abnunch of people, me and the wife included, and sequestering ourselves from civilization from Friday night through Tuesday night.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, it's hard to "play the rules as written" if the sessions are going to be 50h long. ;)<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
J.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            A couple of years ago I picked up a cheap mini-cassette recorder, and I've been using it while I playtest. That way I can listen to the session later and figure out what I was doing to make the game work that I might not have put into the rules. Recently a friend wanted to run a playtest session for me, and I had him record it. Afterwards, I was able to compare the the session with my own and figure out what needed to be changed to make the game run in normal practice how I'd been running it.                        </div>

                            Reaction's comment reminds me of something:<br><br/>Experimenting with note-taking can be very helpful. Folks who have access to all of these should try handwriting, a laptop, a tape recorder, and a handheld with both handwriting recognition and one of the little thumb keyboards. Sometimes you make an unexpected discovery about what works best for you in recording the particular kinds of insights you want to expand on later. Sometimes familiarity is best, but sometimes an unusual-for-you means helps. Worth a shot, anyway.                        </br></div>

                            On a side note: I've just read Paul's comments on riffers and grinders in another thread.<br/>
<br/>
It strikes me there's something similar happening here: "grinding", where you go through a fairly formal process of playing the rules as written and getting feedback afterwards, and "riffing", where you just play the game, switch rules on the fly if you feel like it, and so on.                        </div>

                            Actually, the Grinding/Riffing applies to development as a whole, not playtesting. Ex: Eric's (technomancer) is a Grinder when it comes to making rules, but he switches some rules on the fly when he wants to test them in a pressure environment (or one rule consistently falls down).  I'm a total riffer (stealing from other ideas, running with something that someone else has done before me, etc) but I rarely switch rules on the fly when playtesting (unless something is clearly UnFun-broke, and so far I've been lucky and I haven't done any switching) because I want to get a full idea of how everything relates.<br/><br/>I suspect bringing those design-scale words over here may confuse things on this scale.  How about "straight-up" (play as-written) and "fly-boy" (switch rules on the fly)?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

<p>Actually, I would <em>suspect</em> (we could poll!) that people who develop their rules by riffing are less likely to change the rules during playtest, and people who develop their rules by grinding are more likely to change the rules during playtest.</p>
<p>Basically, my hypothesis is that people look to playtesting to give them something that their normal design strategy doesn't.  But that could be total bollocks.</p>

                            Tony, I know that I certainly playtest to check myself against others' thoughts and perceptions. I have this tendency to elide, when I'm working with concepts I've thought about a long time. Playtesting is indispensible for catching that.<br/><br/>Of course it's not always perfect. None of the playtest groups had any trouble with what turned out to be d20 Gamma World's single largest headache. It was our intention that people use the d20 creature abilities as PC and NPC mutations - we figured, look, books full of cool powers, this'll work great. And <i>all</i> the playtest groups went with this, using the text as written. But dear Lord in Hoboken, the heat from folks who absolutely didn't make the connection....eventually we did sort it out in a way I'm happy with, but it was the single biggest mechanics issue we had, and that despite a dozen groups of wide distribution in location and style. <br/><br/>*shrug* So it goes, I guess.                        </div>
