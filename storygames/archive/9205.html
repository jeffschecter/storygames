The set I've been using for the last year is Body, Wits, Will, Charisma and Schooling. I'm pretty happy with this set for several reasons:<ul><li>They don't cause weird character visualizations for me - I can pretty much understand how a given randomized combination comes about in your average fantasy society without imagining the character as some sort of idiot savant. All of the abilities are similar in how people in the setting learn and improve them, and they are all things the characters in the setting can recognize and name in the setting as well, while also being general enough to be culture-independent. These are not genetic qualities that "just happen", each ability is solidly rooted in life experience as well as accident of birth.</li><li>This set is easy to use, most typical fantasy situations fall neatly under one or other ability. The abilities are also important enough to matter for most characters, so there are no dump-stats. All abilities are easy and sensible to use in ability checks, so there is no ingrained need to derive secondary statistics such as hit points or whatever from them unless I want to.</li><li>A big plus for me is that this set has less body-mind duality than the D&amp;D set. It's also great that the set supports and focuses on social and intellectual challenges in a more balanced manner. For example, a good fighter won't now be all about three physical abilities - there's just one physical ability, so we can also focus on things like courage under fire (willpower) and quick decision-making (wits). Those latter abilities, on the other hand, are also important for your average wizard (typical magic in my D&amp;D homebrew is a concern of schooling and willpower, while you might also need wits when improvising under pressure) or scoundrel - really, all of those abilities are useful to some degree to all characters, I think, which is just great for me.</li></ul>I'm of course not entirely certain that having abilities is even a good idea for an adventure game, but that's my current take on what I use if I have to. I'm not entirely happy with the somewhat ambiguous function of willpower vs. charisma in social context, as it's somewhat arbitrary which a player describes his character using in a given situation. Mostly I think that this is because I've been running social situations with a something of a bastard system that draws on too many sources of implementation logic; one of those abilities will probably be redefined or dropped once I figure out what I'm doing, exactly.<br/><br/>(I should also note that I could easily go for a sixth ability, luck/fate, if I decided to take away arbitrary randomization from the system in favour of making random encounters and whatnot into ability checks. I haven't done this because it doesn't seem very interesting in the fiction when a character "exercises his luck" - things just happen, and by definition it's not because the character did anything interesting.)<br/><br/>For powerfully genrified work my first instinct is to discard the D&amp;D-style ability paradigm altogether and build a different rules system. I also might use the exact same ability set if I decided that the actual contents of the game are sufficiently similar and the genre is just color. The D&amp;D ability paradigm is a very mechanized, layered view on how characters and the world function, so it's easy to transport from setting to setting as long as you're willing to concern yourself with the details of how personal strengths derive from first principles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Hastings" title="Jon Hastings"><img alt="Jon Hastings" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Hastings">Jon Hastings</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203658/#Comment_203658" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-27T08:55:10+00:00" title="April 27, 2009  8:55AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason -\n<blockquote>What's the range of things they need to cover, and the granularity of individual challenges and tasks?</blockquote>\nSo, it seems to me the big "challenge" areas in the kind of adventure game I am thinking of are: combat (broken down into "actual fighting" and "using clever tactics"), social conflict (persuasion, fast-talking), skullduggery (getting into places without being seen), figuring out how various "magical" artifacts/features/creatures "work".  I'm looking for relatively corase granularity, so that any given challenge can be broken down into a just a couple of rolls/checks.\n<blockquote>Is there a desirable number of these attributes you are looking for? Must they be the same for each character?</blockquote>\nI'm looking for them to be mostly the same from character to character (although certain characters might have some "extra" stat if necessary like Wizards with "Power" in some versions of T&amp;T) and want between 4 and 7.<br/><br/>Eero -<br/><br/>Thanks - that all makes sense!  This is all for D&amp;D-style adventuring, so the alternate genres are "mostly color".  I still want characters to be doing the same kind of thing: exploring ruins, encountering creatures, solving puzzles, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Hastings" title="Jon Hastings"><img alt="Jon Hastings" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Hastings">Jon Hastings</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203659/#Comment_203659" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-27T08:57:14+00:00" title="April 27, 2009  8:57AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I should probably add that I'm working off of T&amp;T as a "base" system).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203660/#Comment_203660" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-27T08:59:17+00:00" title="April 27, 2009  8:59AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So you fight, talk, sneak, and appraise?

Obviously, not every character should shine all the time, but in the big group scenes, everyone should have a part.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203693/#Comment_203693" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-27T11:20:40+00:00" title="April 27, 2009 11:20AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: veritascitor</cite>there's being bored to hell because you don't have the Fight ability</blockquote>\nIt's not an ability, it's just not part of who you are.

Surely, if you are an awesome sneaker, you can find some way to make that matter to your party's ultimate success.  You may not stab the monster, but perhaps you can sneak around to the back and find the trigger on the trap door that will dump the monster into the bottomless pit while your fightier friends maneuver it into position?  Or, at a bare minimum, you can hide in shadows, yield the spotlight, cheer on your friends, and then provide comic relief at the end when you re-emerge?<br/><br/>Edit: Crossed with Jason.
