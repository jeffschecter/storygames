Without it, the exercise becomes plain creative writing, or storytelling.<br/><br/>Still, engaging a randomizer results in a break in the flow of imagination as you interpret the results. The break in the flow might be short, but it is there. I've found that trying to keep a cohesive feeling to the story sometimes means that the breaks are longer as I try to make sense of some random result in context of what has happened in the story prior to that.<br/><br/>What is your sweet spot in terms of percentages? Do you have any rules of thumb as to when to call upon Randomness?<br/><br/>I have created a little poll to see if I can get a feeling of how often folks engage their randomizers:<br/><br/><a href="http://poll.pollcode.com/7v8uy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://poll.pollcode.com/7v8uy</a><br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420994/#Comment_420994" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-02T12:16:23+00:00" title="September  2, 2013 12:16PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The 'break' is a tricky thing.  I love the randomness since it offers a challenge to me to make it all fit.  So, it's like a mini-game in that respect.  In the style that I play, I begin a new scene with a roll of some Rory's Story Cubes and throughout the dialogue I'll reference the Mythic GME tables.  But, while I randomize a lot, I minimize that break by making it very short, story cubes give you an instant result in the form of icons on the dice and I write my solo story/game log inside of an Excel spreadsheet that has the GME tables already built-in.  I get results in a few clicks without having to hit the books.   So, I spend the vast major of the time in descriptions and dialog even though I might use randomness a half dozen times in a scene.<br/>--<br/>TAZ<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B06hdt8eB6Y7NzZjMDliMTItOTM4Zi00MmY3LWFjMzktOGNiOGM1Njk2Zjdm/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">For those that are curious about that style of solo story telling...</a><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421016/#Comment_421016" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-03T06:47:52+00:00" title="September  3, 2013  6:47AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/TAZ">@TAZ</a>:<br/><br/>If you had to come up with a very rough ratio for how many times you use random input per plot points + NPC actions + color details, what would that ratio be?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421019/#Comment_421019" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-03T07:19:25+00:00" title="September  3, 2013  7:19AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My preferred way to drive solo play is setting constraints on the future narrative.

The constraint comes from needing to use all the options on the list before you can re-use any of them. Combine this with a similar list of new situation prompts (preferably starting with a different number of options), and you are frequently faced with difficult decisions based on your past actions, without any need for randomness.<br/><br/>   - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421060/#Comment_421060" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-03T23:03:31+00:00" title="September  3, 2013 11:03PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If you had to come up with a very rough ratio for how many times you use random input per plot points + NPC actions + color details, what would that ratio be?</blockquote>\n[cross posted]<br/><br/>Wow, looking over Yuki's tale, it's a really high percentage.  Each roll generates a paragraph of scene, action, or dialog.  It's not 1 to 1 since sometimes I'll get 'wordy' before getting back to the dice.  Excel says it is 70 or so rolls and 111 paragraphs for chapter one.  Given that most of those long paragraphs are extended dialog, I'll stand by 90+ as a percentage.  It's not as random and chaotic as it might sound.

The thing that draws in a lot of people to gaming is the interaction with the players and GM and the surprise when they do something unexpected.  Randomization does that to some extent, the key is to not make everything a coin flip.  For example, the Mythic GM Emulator has a graded scale from exceptional no to exceptional yes and these values are based on a sliding scale of likelihood and the chaos factor.  The net result is that the logical thing usually happens, but every now and then the system throws you a curve ball.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421212/#Comment_421212" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-08T03:46:36+00:00" title="September  8, 2013  3:46AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lot of early Matrix games were run as solo story games. The system used the idea of conflict between two sides. Each turn the player would make up two short stories about what happens next. One argument is the best outcome one side (the good guys) and the other what the other side would want from the story. Next the player steps back from partisanship and decides what side's argument is stronger and then assigns numbers to a roll to see which action happens. Roll to see which becomes reality.<br/><br/>The story builds up one conflict at a time. <br/><br/>This works well but doesn't include a random element. A player could roll randomness and then use that as the starting point of each turn. It does make all moves meaningful, which is challenging when very much randomness is used.<br/><br/>Solo games and creative writing are pretty closely related.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421213/#Comment_421213" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-08T08:33:36+00:00" title="September  8, 2013  8:33AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Speaking of creative writing's link with solo gaming, its worth taking a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oulipo" rel="nofollow">Oulipo</a> for further inspirations on random and non-random creative constraints on story and narrative.

However, I don't want it to be an exercise in "straight", or maybe a better word is "plain" creative writing, in the sense of just sitting down  and writing what comes to mind and basically leaving it at that. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">@wyrmwood</a>: That link is very interesting. Food for thought, definitely.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/zircher">@zircher</a>: I was crazy enough to try to do away with writing altogether. I was using a voice recorder, thinking that it would speed me up, but I still had the same sort of blocks, and indecision. I ended up with a lot of "Mmms" as I thought, which resulted in a lot of silence in between narration. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/matrixgamer">@matrixgamer</a>: That's the way I've been doing it lately, except that I only have myself, and Lady Luck to test the truth of my ideas (I think "argument" is a better way of framing it, now that I read your post). <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>[Edit: I should add, though, that I don't test the whole argument, but rather one or two of its ideas (usually the last ones). ]<br/><br/>I also like to have some constraints on my "arguments" such as having prior premises strongly support them. It approximates that feeling that I'm not just running willy-nilly with ideas, but have some "force" outside myself guiding the narrative. Yet, that force is not entirely or even mostly based on randomness, so I feel it flows a bit easier.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421292/#Comment_421292" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-09T17:46:59+00:00" title="September  9, 2013  5:46PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The recording idea has merit, I've edited a few actual play pod casts in the day and dead air/pauses are the easiest thing to remove with the right tools.

So, in these cases I usually rely on randomness for a final judgement. This is what I'm trying to reduce, though. Either I need some sort of arbitrary cutoff where I say "if it's more likely than not just treat it as a True". <br/><br/>I like your suggestion, because feels very similar to causal inference. Still, I think I will still run into the "issue" above, because the post-facto reasons may not be conclusive-- so I will still have a lot of situations where the conclusion will be "likely true" instead of absolutely true. <br/><br/>Thinking about it, I have a few ideas on further constraints as far as when to use randomness:<br/><br/>1. If something is more likely to be true than not, just treat it as it being true. It happened in the fiction. <br/>2. Only use randomness to determine truth when some conclusion is not likely to be true given the established facts/premises. <br/><br/>I could combine this with an idea similar to the one <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/421212#Comment_421212" rel="nofollow">you shared above</a>  where I just write a scene, or a sequence of x number of actions and then later use randomness to test the truth of each of the conclusions/actions/plot points made. If one of them is determined to be false by luck, then I need to see how that affects the conclusions after that (it may not at all). It's still going to be quite a process, but I think it might flow better for me than just asking an oracle whether something happens before I go with it.  <br/><br/>As an aside, I was actually thinking of creating a mini-game for the Gamechef competition based on a similar idea, except I'd be using a <a href="http://ludios.org/bayes/" rel="nofollow">Bayesian probability algorithm</a> to try and change events in the past [Edit: or, more to the point, in an established storyline.].  I thought it might be fun to try it with things like the plot of Blade Runner, with Roy Batty as the Hero, and try to change its facts to change the story. Each time one fact changed, one would have to consider the effects down the line, if any, at least in outline form. Then one would keep testing the facts down the timeline in an iterative fashion until there was some sort of end.<br/><br/>However, I never considered trying to do what you mentioned some Matrix games did. I'll give that a whirl to see how it feels.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
