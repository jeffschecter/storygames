And I GM'ed a short campaign of it last fall.<br><br>The twitter length description is "basic D&amp;D meets Traveller." It's a mashup of D&amp;D's stats and combat with Traveller's skills. <br/><br/>It's super easy and VERY familiar to just about anyone who sits down to play. It allows for a lot of the OSR "eyeballing" style that I have grown to like, somewhat the opposite of, say, Pathfinder. <br/><br/>Andy, you could very easily "mod" it to Star Frontiers. Give Yazirians, e.g., -1 to STR and CON, +1 to DEX and INT, maybe. Battle rage would maybe be +1 to hit/dmg melee only, but difficult to kick in, just like in SF.<br/><br/>XP by default is based mostly on credits earned, but that section of the book takes up maybe half a page? Hackability? Easy. <br/><br/>There are also character goals, which highly resemble the side quests in D&amp;D4, or perhaps the BITs in BW. You get XP for pursuing them.<br/><br/>It's definitely NOT a heroic power fantasy, so teenage me thinks this game sucks. But grownup me likes that any fight is potentially deadly. Not quite as grim as Luke's account of Moldvay D&amp;D, but in that neighborhood. Characters start out with crap HP just like that, and big guns kill things dead. <br/><br/>Combat gets about a page and a half in the text (but I don't know anything about a whole minute of swashbuckling; rounds are 6 seconds). Spaceship movement, combat, travel and repair gets 5 pages, including an example. It's lightweight and fast.<br/><br/>It's fun to watch any confrontation and see the players thinking, shit, this could turn fatal if it escalates, then awesome exciting when they decide to go for it.<br/><br/>The existence of rare, ancient, advanced tech in the setting serves as "magic items" for the characters, so you can provide the fun of neat treasure and gadgets and all that. Some old laser pistol from the days before the Scream, which has +1 accuracy. Or vials of nanotech healing drugs which cure 1d4+1 HP right then and there, etc. Steal from your D&amp;D books and make something up on the fly.<br/><br/>Spaceships are easy. Pick a hull type and fill it with components that stay within available space and power. Ship combat, like personal combat, is something you really hope you don't have to do, but when you have to it's deadly and exciting.<br/><br/>Hope that helps. John has played a lot more than I have and will probably have a lot more to say.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362867/#Comment_362867" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-27T06:04:10+00:00" title="February 27, 2012  6:04AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and the author has created a number of additional free PDF supplements for the game that are pretty good.

In the end it went okay, and I was wearing plate mail so he had a hell of a time (yeah, I'm some kind of sci-fi Muslim templar) but it was pretty nervewracking. I thought the first session was going to end with my character bleeding out where nobody could find him. I don't know how I'd be feeling if that had been the results, but as it is I'm excited to play again and the anxiety of getting in fights actually makes for a really cool game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362881/#Comment_362881" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-27T07:32:26+00:00" title="February 27, 2012  7:32AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2012 7:48AM by Vernon R.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So what do the characters do in such a game?

I think the conceits are similar. <br/><br/>The XP for money default reward system encourages slightly unscrupulous characters who are looking for the easiest way to earn the most creds. Maybe space pirates, but that sounds dangerous. There's probably an easier way to make a buck, I would think.<br/><br/>It's a somewhat post-apocalyptic setting (possibly borrowing a bit from Traveller TNE) where many worlds are "lost" or have reverted to a primitive status. So there's plenty of exploring to do if that floats your boat.<br/><br/>One of the characters in our game has the "tribal" background, as he's from a world that reverted to stone age tech after the crash (the "Scream" in game terms).  He's not even sure where that world is, as he was kidnapped by mercenaries and then sold into indentured labor. So that makes for a good character goal along the way.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362892/#Comment_362892" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-27T08:12:54+00:00" title="February 27, 2012  8:12AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2012 8:16AM by anansigirl.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Wilson</cite>The twitter length description is "basic D&amp;D meets Traveller."

We're actually using Traveller and Stars Without Number for two of our scif-fi games right now (a Halo game using Traveller and a generic space rogues game using SWN). They are pretty similar (so if Traveller is OSR for you then, ok, maybe OSR). I dunno, I find SWN pretty rules light and not so crunchy. But we've only played 3-4 sessions so far. Everything is pretty straightforward. I like the setting's idea of tech, pre-tech, post-tech. The stuff you can buy is nifty and actually useable in the game. It's pretty accessible and sandboxy. It actually reminds me a lot of Mass Effect.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>What separates it from classic space RPGs like Star Frontiers, or newer space RPGs like Hard Nova or Diaspora?</blockquote>\nCompared to Diaspora, its way less crunchy. In my humble opinion. It uses similar setting creation rules, I think. Not sure about comparisons to the others mentioned. It's definitely easier to do character creation, and has simpler rules than Strands of Fate, if we're comparing other sci-fi systems. We're starting a Star Wars game in SoF, and man, it took us like, two weeks to figure out how Jedi were going to work in that system. Overly complex for no good reason. (Somehow, we're playing THREE sci-fi games right now. This is highly unusual).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>What kinds of cool things happened at your table directly attributable to the game?</blockquote>\nI'll keep ya posted on this one, the system has yet to BLOW MY MIND.

Even a 1st level dude should be rolling +2 or so for his main thing, which is pretty great. I'm not sure how you could suck at everything you were supposed to be good at. Even with a 0 you have fairly good odds.<br/><br/>(Combat is a different beast, since if you have to "roll to hit" you must bring out the dreaded d20 and take your chances. It's chaotic as hell. But, like pretty much every OSR style game, actually getting into a firefight and having to roll to hit means you have fucked something up.)<br/><br/>[EDIT: This shift from reliable 2d6 bell curve for skills to crazy d20 for combat is one of my favorite things about the system.]<br/><br/>So, I dunno, Our SWN characters are very capable, even at 1st level, and are really shining at 3rd - 5th now (though they're still fragile as hell -- good thing one of the psychics has that resurrection power mastered).<br/><br/>[EDIT: Don't have time for my SWN mega-post right now.

There's so much to talk about. I love so many things about this game it's hard to unpack it. It'll take a few posts.<br/><br/><b>1. The Classes</b><br/>The game has three character classes: Warrior, Expert, and Psychic. They're kind of standard D&amp;Dish classes at first glance (different hit dice, saves, etc.) but then they have <i>the best</i> class abilities. A Warrior can ignore the damage from one hit per combat. An Expert can re-roll their dice once per in-game hour. A Psychic gets woogie psionic powers (which they can 'master' and use as much as they want, as Matt mentioned above). They're so simple and consequential -- it really matters which class you are.<br/><br/><b>2. The Backgrounds</b><br/>You know I love the two-word character type, and SWN delivers it with your character Background and Training Package. You might be a Con-Artist Pilot, a Hermit Psychic-Researcher, a Bandit Space-Marine, etc. These give you some skill levels, but we also treat the fiction really seriously here. If you were a Space Marine, you were a <i>Space Marine</i>. That sometimes positions you to make tests you might not otherwise get to make or attempt to win outcomes that others can't or not have to make a save that someone else might have to make.<br/><br/>[Example from play: Dylan's ex-Space Marine "William Independent Contractor" (that's his name, used to be William Hanjin but he quit that job) is trying desperately to save his crew-mates who are currently mind-controlled by the horrible psychic hellhole on Triton. He figures out that hurting them gives them a chance to snap out of the mind-whammy. So he pulls off his oxygen tank (this is all happening in the dark, zero-g corridors of an ancient space hulk, btw), throws it at some crew-mates, and detonates it with a shot from his mazer rifle.<br/><br/>William is a space marine, so I don't call for a Physical save (yet) when he rips off his mask and air supply. He's a rough motherfucker. So he also doesn't have to roll to hit the tiny air tank using the dreaded d20, he gets to make a skill test instead. Even in the dark, in zero-g, shooting at a small target, with no air supply, William's space marine background means he isn't thrown into the chaos of a combat roll. This is day one of boot camp.]<br/><br/>More to come...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus" title="nikodemus"><img alt="nikodemus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus">nikodemus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363259/#Comment_363259" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T03:30:24+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  3:30AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            !!

Number of helpers and skill used is as always subject to what makes sense in the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363502/#Comment_363502" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T14:41:09+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  2:41PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I echo the synesthetic sentiment that this is sounding cooler every time I look at this thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363511/#Comment_363511" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T15:00:37+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  3:00PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>These give you some skill levels, but we also treat the fiction really seriously here.

Some GMs end up forcing a skill check on everything more complicated than tying your bootlaces, or prohibit PCs from even hoping to accomplish a feat for which they lack the appropriate skill. Skill checks are not meant to be the sole way that a PC gets something accomplished in the world.<br/><br/>You should be charitable about the things a character can accomplish without a skill check. If an Expert\u2019s concept is that of a crack spaceship pilot with a Dexterity modifier of +2 and Vehicles/Space-2 skill, you shouldn\u2019t be expecting him to make skill checks to operate the ship under normal conditions. He can take off, he can land, he can get to places in the system without bothering with skill checks. Even someone with Vehicles/Space-0 should likely be able to do as much, except the expert pilot can do it without a check even amid high winds and low visibility. Let the PCs be good at their chosen focus.<br/><br/>Don\u2019t spam skill checks. If a character is trying to repair a fusion power plant while under fire from badlands raiders, don\u2019t turn it into a roll-each-turn extravaganza to determine how far he progresses in his attempt. Let him roll once, with a failure meaning either that he can\u2019t do it in the available time or that he\u2019ll need another 1d6 rounds before he can bring the defense laser power plant online. Give him player choices each turn, like deciding whether to bring a laser online early and risk a short in the wiring. Let a single skill check indicate the general course of success or failure, but then let the PC make additional choices rather than additional rolls. Rolls can only add so much tension, and tension alone does not guarantee engagement with a situation.<br/><br/>Don\u2019t require a skill check unless failing it means something...</i><br/><br/>So if Harper is drifting, he's not drifting far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363550/#Comment_363550" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T16:23:09+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  4:23PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><i>Let the PCs be good at their chosen focus.</i></b><br/><br/>Yep, that's it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tavis" title="Tavis"><img alt="Tavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tavis">Tavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363601/#Comment_363601" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T18:24:30+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  6:24PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2012 6:25PM by Tavis.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I believe that some killer combination of the top-down approach pioneered by SwN and expanded in Red Tide and <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product_info.php?products_id=99063&amp;" rel="nofollow">An Echo, Resounding</a> (with its superb advice on how to use it) + the bottom-up approach of ACKS (and its glorious focus on the details of the concrete and of RPG history) will be what we will all be playing in 2014.

The process of boiling it down enough to transmit across cultures and oceans, and then taking that echo and refining it again for export, is a good recipe for making highly addictive crack.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo use your example: if you go through the process of making your radioactive dungeon with SWN tags that teach you about abstraction and what matters at the top level, and then do it again with ACKS rules that let you hand the players the work of figuring out how many henchmen and ropes they need to buy during the runup to getting the party's wizard to build that dungeon and harvest spell components from it, you will emerge with a masterful understanding of what that dark master is capable of and why he does what he does.

The Faction System</b><br/>SWN has a simple but interesting Faction mini-game that the GM plays behind the scenes. Basically, each faction gets ratings in Force, Cunning, and Wealth, then some tags (like Savage, Secretive, Colonists, etc.) and assets. The assets are weapons that the faction uses in the mini-game, each keyed to one of the stats (Force, Cunning, Wealth). Assets are things like space transports, spies, assassins, surveyors, banks, etc. Each faction turn (roughly a month) a faction gets one move. This usually means activating an asset and doing its thing, or moving an asset somewhere, or making a new asset.<br/><br/>Here's why this is cool:<br/>- Faction moves are resolved with a simple d10+stat roll, so they're super quick and easy. You can do them all in no time.<br/>- Using faction moves instantly creates a living world backdrop for the game. The status quo isn't maintained, things are always changing outside the influence of the PCs.<br/>- The random rolls mean you sometimes get surprising outcomes, so there's a built-in check against over planning future events.<br/><br/>Let me tell you a story about how the PCs in our game got a nuclear bomb.<br/><br/>The Psychic Academy faction has an asset (a Psychic Assassin) that they want to use against the Perimeter Agency faction. The Academy is about to open the dormant jumpgate, and when they do that, the Perimeter is gonna get all up in their business, so the Academy is making a pre-emptive strike.<br/><br/>So, a couple turns ago, I move the Psychic Assassin asset out to Saturn (using their Covert Transit Net asset) so he's in range to strike the Perimeter. He is armed with a briefcase nuke, to destroy the Perimeter HQ.<br/><br/>Before that happens, though, my super secret weird faction, [REDACTED], makes a move and due to the dice, a really crazy thing happens. This leads to the destruction of another faction's asset (a Surveyor ship) and an advantage for [REDACTED] that I hadn't thought of before. So, using the weird result of the faction roll, I wrote up a mission lead involving the "destroyed" (actually missing and scuttled) survey ship and posted it on the job board we use in the game.<br/><br/>And wouldn't you know it, but the players chose the "missing survey ship" mission as their next task (from a pool of about 12 other possible jobs).<br/><br/>To pursue that mission -- out at Neptune/Triton -- the PCs had to first go to Saturn/Titan and make arrangements with the Perimeter to use their slipgate so they could more easily make the long transit out to Neptune. And then it hit me: Wait, the Academy definitely would have known about the crazy thing that happened with [REDACTED] on that faction roll, and they have an asset <i>right there</i> at Saturn already. They would totally re-task the Psychic Assassin and send him out to Neptune instead to try to squash the craziness that [REDACTED] was up to!<br/><br/>So, next faction turn, just as the PCs headed out to Neptune themselves, I made the roll for the Psychic Assassin's mission out to Neptune/Triton with the nuke. Result: utter failure. Whoops! To keep things neat and tidy, I decided to fold the two results together: The success of [REDACTED] against the surveyor vessel and the utter failure of the Psychic Assassin and the nuke would be one and the same. The Assassin got passage aboard the surveyor ship out to Neptune, then when the ship got ganked by [REDACTED], the Assassin was foiled too (and he was killed, in fact).<br/><br/>(This is kind of hard to untangle and talk about, I hope it's making sense so far)<br/><br/>Basically, at this stage, due to the faction moves and outcomes we had:<br/>- A missing surveyor ship, scuttled, drifting near Neptune<br/>- A psychic assassin, passenger on the surveyor ship, killed before he could use his nuclear bomb against [REDACTED]<br/><br/>Then the PCs arrived on the scene.<br/><br/>Long story short, after lots of crazy hi-jinks and all the PCs almost dying several times over in desperate struggle against the mind-controlling psionic hellhole of [REDACTED] on Triton, they managed to capture the scuttled survey ship. Then, being space pirates, they searched every inch of it for loot.<br/><br/>And they found the nuke. So now the PCs have a nuke.<br/><br/>So, the faction system!

So all the inter-connected star systems of the Terran Mandate were suddenly very alone. In our setting, a Spike drive lets you go super fast in-system, but can't be used to jump out of the sector. You need a gigantic jump-gate for that, and it's been out of commission for 600 years.<br/><br/>(we also have "slip gates" that accelerate your spike drive and let you go even faster in-system, with a much lower fuel cost)<br/><br/>Kevin has a blog post about solar system games here: <a href="http://www.sinenomine-pub.com/?p=149" rel="nofollow">http://www.sinenomine-pub.com/?p=149</a><br/><br/>Our series started in the months leading up to the jump-gate being fixed. It's technically online now, but the PCs have been out of contact with the rest of the solar system and don't know if anyone has actually used the gate yet. There's been talk among the players about trying to go through the gate at some point, and I expect that will either mark the end of our campaign, or the beginning of a whole new stage of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364014/#Comment_364014" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T16:17:52+00:00" title="February 29, 2012  4:17PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, check out this madness:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.emichron.com/swn/" rel="nofollow">http://www.emichron.com/swn/</a><br/><br/>It auto generates a SWN sector for you, complete with Worlds, NPCs, Corporations, Politics, Religions, and Aliens.<br/><br/>Dang.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364044/#Comment_364044" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T17:47:29+00:00" title="February 29, 2012  5:47PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dang indeed.

What aspects of it has this particular game pioneered?</blockquote>\nBottom-up is what classic Traveller does: what is the price of fish on this world? ACKS doesn't pioneer this but it does take it really seriously, and makes sure that that answer is consistent with all the other little details and their inter-relationships that together create a coherent entity. But because it's formed from the roots it can be hard to see the forest for the trees.<br/><br/>Top-down is what you can see SWN doing in the generator above: does this world have the Seagoing Cities tag? If SWN didn't pioneer this it's sure what I associate with the approach. It's awesome because it gives you the salient gameable details of something as big as a planet and lets you hook up all the other slightly lower level things like of course that means there are pirate city captains and giant pearls. But because it's imposed from above it can be hard to reach down to the roots; you are guessing at the price of fish.<br/><br/>The combination of the two would be building up ACKS-type detail until you reached the point where you could tag that whole thing as a Seagoing Cities system. This gives you the missing top-down piece - you don't need to delve into the detail until you need it, but it is there to be had, there is a seamless integration of detail and concept that doesn't crash into an abstraction disjunction - and the missing bottom-up piece, where your Traveller characters are like "why is the price of fish so low in this system we are thinking about trading with?" and you don't have to generate or assimilate all the data yourself to reach the conclusion "because it's Seagoing Cities".<br/><br/>I learned these terms in my former life in neuroscience, where such combination is the holy grail. Having these approaches integrated would make statements like "he is depressed because he has high serotonin levels" more meaningful than saying "I like Shakespeare because he uses the letter E so often."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364081/#Comment_364081" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T23:04:00+00:00" title="February 29, 2012 11:04PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 29, 2012 11:04PM by rafial.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>...they managed to capture the scuttled survey ship.

We <b>did not</b> search the ship as a matter of course. We were left so rattled and skittish as a result of recent events we had almost forgotten about looting. Then our paranoid teleporter/telekinetic who was busy perusing the teleport power list previewing how awesome he was going to be in the future, had a horrible thought: "what if there was somebody on the surface of Triton who was even more awesome than me, and could teleport from surface to orbit. THEY MIGHT BE HIDING ON OUR SHIP(S). RIGHT NOW."<br/><br/>And so in the grand tradition of "better safe than sorry" (and because the last time we searched our ship we found a bomb planted on the hull) we organized a sweep of the interior of both our vessel and the survey craft. And because that sweep was being carried out by a crack team of space marine types, and because they rolled like gods, we found the hidden compartment in the dead crewman's quarters that just happened to contain a mysterious metal suitcase and an encrypted dataslab.<br/><br/>And to top it off, we were in such a rush to get on with "other projects" due to a highly hypothetical timetable that we have imagined for ourselves (our teleporter is not the only paranoid crew member) that we put those tasty items in storgage. Until the bored "face" character, who really has nothing to do in the current circumstances, decide to play with the mysterious suitcase and the pretech biocrypt we just happened to have lying around. Which told him it might be a bomb, or it might not. After which he <i>seriously</i> considered quietly shoving out the airlock.<br/><br/>Oh it's been a long strange trip indeed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364128/#Comment_364128" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T06:28:06+00:00" title="March  1, 2012  6:28AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh my god that generator thing just did in a second what I spent 6 hours on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364172/#Comment_364172" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T08:34:44+00:00" title="March  1, 2012  8:34AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That generator now has me actively interested in this game!

Thanks for the kind words about the sector generator! Thought you might be interested to know about a few enhancements that are in the works:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. I originally wrote the app to output to PDF, and I am working on adding that back to the generator as download option for completely offline play. This will be available in the next month or so.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Apparently the generator is pretty popular in France. I've sent off the app's database to a translator who got the author's permission to translate the app to French. Not sure what the timeline is on that one (zut alors!)<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, if you are an iPad user, check out an app called TWEdit. I didn't write it, but I did make sure that all of the coolness built into the generated TiddlyWiki files works correctly when viewed in TWEdit. Some of my players do this, and the ability to have pan-galactic information in a thin tablet is, well, kind of like science fiction :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again, and happy gaming!<br/>\n<br/>\n--Harrison                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364218/#Comment_364218" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T10:35:04+00:00" title="March  1, 2012 10:35AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those additions sound awesome, Harrison.

It's usually a complementary skill, which I call out as GM  -- "Test Tech/Astronautics... help with Tech/Post-Tech...." A helping roll of 7+ gives the other character +1 to their test. If you miss (6-) you complicate matters.<br/><br/>Sometimes help isn't a roll. If an extra body doing the thing is beneficial, it just works -- usually reducing the time required for the project.<br/><br/>So far, we've allowed more than one person to help (so several +1s are possible). Hasn't been an issue, but I'm thinking I might switch it to AW style: multiple people can roll to help, but you only get a max of +1 from them. I'm also considering setting a target number for helping based on the situation, instead of always defaulting to 7.<br/><br/><b>2) Solar System Travel Rules</b><br/>Which you can find here: <a href="http://www.sinenomine-pub.com/?p=149" rel="nofollow">http://www.sinenomine-pub.com/?p=149</a><br/><br/><b>3) Chargen</b><br/>Each player created three characters to begin: One level 3 character and two level 1 characters. I do not pull punches and the game is quite deadly so it's handy to have extra bodies around when they start dropping like flies.<br/><br/>Thanks to the <i>totally awesome</i> psychics in the group, no one has died permanently (yet). A lot of them have one or more deaths on their punch-card though.<br/><br/><b>4) Resurrection Costs</b><br/>Being brought back to life gives you 3 permanent system strain. Being brought back after really catastrophic bodily destruction (using the pre-tech bio sarcophagus that the PCs looted) gives you 6 permanent system strain.<br/><br/><b>5) Rolling to Hit, or Not</b><br/>We judge the need for to-hit rolling on a case by case basis. If the target is not aware of you and actively fighting/avoiding your attacks, you don't have to roll to hit. Often, you just roll damage. Other times, you make a skill test.<br/><br/>The d20 hit roll only happens in a full-on fight between two parties exchanging violence. Which does happen, but less often than one-way violence (especially with teleport ambushes).<br/><br/>There are probably some more.

The characters were created as the crew of our original ship, and are all "on tap" at any time, all though not necessarily "in focus" at any given time. When we play out scenes, we'll focus on those characters who have a reason to participate, typically the ones using skills, or who have some dramatic reason to be there. When selecting away teams for particular missions, or when "splitting" the crew across multiple locations in a situation that may result in simultaneous actions scenes there is usually attention given to having at least one character from each player in each location if the needs of the mission can accommodate that, so that every player has an active voice in all parts of the action. During resolution of long downtimes, we'll go around the table and determine how each of our characters are spending the time. We have a tendency to engage in lots of "science projects" during such times, so the characters will often group into "lab teams", and then we'll play out the resolution of those projects. Players can definitely have more than one character in a scene, and having one of your characters help another is allowed.<br/><br/>Our style of player makes heavy use of "free and clear" discussion at the table, with all information uncovered by any character known to all players. The players take responsibility for determining what subset of those facts each of their characters are aware of and determining their reactions appropriately.  This does keep a lot of play in "pawn stance", but we do have occasional moments of in character play as well. This typically arises in specific "focus scenes" and occasionally from at the table riffing, where two players suddenly hit on a moment they'd like to have pass between two of their characters and briefly play it out.  It's certainly been interesting for me to try to make sure each of my characters has a unique voice and style.<br/><br/>We've had a few alterations in the roster since beginning. One character who was conceived of as coming from a "tech primitivist" culture, and who had a relationship with the Perimeter (the tech police) was retired by her player after our first mission made it clear that we were going to be dabbling with a lot of semi-legal pretech. She was replaced by an NPC, a pre-scream super psychic researcher whose consciousness we found in an ancient computer system, and who got "decanted" into a clone body, with concomitant loss of memory/ability to scale her down to fit the party power level. One of my starting level 1 characters became integrated into our original ship by symbiotic nanotech, and so when we traded that ship away, he went with it, and became an NPC. I haven't chosen to "refill" that slot in my roster so far. The character "William Independent Contractor" mentioned up thread (who was originally "William Hanjin", Hanjin being the megacorp we originally worked for) never really got much screen time until very recently, when a crisis left him as one of only two characters in control of their faculties and in a position to rescue the rest of the crew. So he suddenly went from being a blank slate to being a focus character, which was an interesting process to work out.<br/><br/>I've found this style of play very successful for the kind of game we've been playing. It's allowed the central "ship and crew" conceit of our game to work very smoothly, without having to bog the GM down with managing a bunch of NPCs, and allowed players to put their oar into all different kinds of scenes, be they talky, techy, or fighty.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366395/#Comment_366395" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-10T06:30:05+00:00" title="March 10, 2012  6:30AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: grmbrand</cite>Finally, if you are an iPad user, check out an app called TWEdit.
