The performance flow is not interrupted by dice throwing, plot clarification, skill checks etc.<br/><br/>In my experience, both phases benefit from it:<br/>The planning get's really a focus on carving out the most fun scene, brainstorming creatively.<br/>The acting get's the full joy of losing yourself in the performance.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BRUJ02" title="BRUJ02"><img alt="BRUJ02" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BRUJ02">BRUJ02</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443637/#Comment_443637" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-04T03:56:15+00:00" title="March  4, 2015  3:56AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul_T, why do you say separating the two is counter to playing the game?

(e.g. In Monsterhearts, Joe - the author - writes that the rules and the dice serve to "keep the game feral". These people took the stance that such practice "tame" the game and allow people to vet all outcomes in advance, at which point they might as well not play.)<br/><br/>The latter group seemed to "win out" over time, but a few people remained unconvinced and liked such techniques (and still do, presumably).<br/><br/>This affected the design of many games, and the way conflicts are handled in, for example, <i>In a Wicked Age...</i> and <i>Apocalypse World</i> seem to me to be reactions to that whole discussion. (In both games, a more standard "stake setting" procedure is replaced with different ways of handling the fallout of conflicts. Both approaches were pretty unusual/innovative when these games were designed.)<br/><br/>There were many, many discussions around this topic for several years, in any case.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443772/#Comment_443772" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-06T19:29:28+00:00" title="March  6, 2015  7:29PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the update, Paul.

Or maybe more accurately, that children demonstrate how recreation can be a developmental tool. Many children (especially once they reach 4 or 5) center their play around very developmentally salient issues. I have a lot of experience working with preschoolers and they love to play about death, sickness, responsibility, loss, bodies, and other universal human issues.<br/><br/>The scene-setting/scene-playing distinction is interesting, but I think that's just one tree in the forest. When you zoom out, one of the most distinctive things about children's play is how adaptive it is. Sometimes they set a scene before playing it, sometimes they improvise completely. Older children engage in a constant dialog about the constraints of the fiction/game world, sometimes implicitly and sometimes explicitly. Remember arguing about how many people can be Captain America at once? That's kids negotiating the fiction.<br/><br/>One of the greatest things about watching kids play is seeing how creative storyplayers bring in children with very diverse play styles. Some kids who want to play very quiet "House" scenarios are very good at incorporating other children who want more physically active play. Children who want to build complex structures can often find heavy lifting or role-playing elements for other children who aren't as engineering-oriented. It's really interesting to watch a group with very different motivations and skill sets work together to improvise a game that meets all their needs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443928/#Comment_443928" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-11T19:34:41+00:00" title="March 11, 2015  7:34PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great post, thanks, Ludo!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443946/#Comment_443946" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-12T07:49:11+00:00" title="March 12, 2015  7:49AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I loved it too, Lobo. <br/>As you've described, I can only <i>highly</i> recommend playing RPG (or Freeform) with children.
