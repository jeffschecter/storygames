A friend dropped some old stuff he didn't want, including a box set, &lt;a href="<a href='http://home.flash.net/~brenfrow/dd1/firstquest.htm"&gt;First' rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://home.flash.net/~brenfrow/dd1/firstquest.htm"&gt;First</a> Quest&lt;/a&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nFQ is the kind of ambitious product we don't see anymore. You've got absolutely everything in there to actually DM. Screen, dice, minis, maps and &lt;b&gt;plenty &lt;/b&gt;of books and booklets with rules and adventures. Then you also have the audio CD. All in all, this product has big production values. On a sheer bulk level, it beats the shit out of the attempts at beginner's boxsets WotC released for 3.x.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have only skimmed through but I found something interesting. After rules and everything are explained, you get to the actual four adventures. They are supposed to be played in order and the first one is &lt;b&gt;The Tomb of Demara&lt;/b&gt;. They take place near a town that has (explicitly) &lt;i&gt;no name &lt;/i&gt;and only three NPCs. One is a wizard who can identify your items for gold. One is a cleric who will only heal you for money or magic items and the last one is a store owner who can sell you stuff and exchange gems for gold. I'll skip all the classic advice to the DM, which include reading through the adventure, making sure he knows the rules and so on. Then we're told how the adventure starts. All the heroes are hangin' out at the Red Dragon Tavern in "the town". And then the town cryer calls for adventurers and inquiring minds are supposed to follow him to the wizard's tower. What follows will be direct quotes from the book:<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************************<br/>\n&lt;b&gt;Ask the players:&lt;/b&gt; "Are you going to follow the town cryer?"<br/>\n-&lt;b&gt;Yes:&lt;/b&gt; Play CD track 3, resume adventure<br/>\n-&lt;b&gt;No:&lt;/b&gt; Tell them they go back to the tavern and do nothing for several hours. Then ask them if they want to go to Nethril's Tower. Keep doing this until they realize that nothing else is going to happen until they follow the town cryer<br/>\n***********************************************************************************<br/>\n<i>EDIT: There are no guidelines anywhere, no sidebars on how to handle inquisitive players. No contingency plans for the rookie DM if they refuse. No guidelines if they want to interact with the folks at the tavern, or what to do if they want to explore the town-that-has-no-name-and-even-worse-no-map.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nI must confess this has to be one of the lamest RPG setup I've ever seen. And it is scary to find this in a product aimed at beginners. I don't care if you're a simulationist, gamist, narrativist, immersionist, fabulist or occultist. There are thousands of ways to setup an adventure, each drastically different and each one better than this. It's like they put the worse option possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat the fuck were they thinking?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>EDIT: me spel bad</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98581/#Comment_98581" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T08:34:39+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  8:34AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First Quest?<br><br>Shit.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98583/#Comment_98583" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T08:36:44+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  8:36AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>First Quest?<br><br>Shit.</br></br></blockquote>\nIndeed.

Yes, Tony, while it's possible that the game is merely not about the "town" part of play, and all about getting to the adventure, the question is whether or not the game is being direct about this. If what's being portrayed about the game above is true, it sounds like some dysfunctional GM who's written a game to deal with his "problem players" using punitive measures made to make the players feel bad by insulting them, if they've made the wrong decision. Note a decision which may or may not be explicitly laid out elsewhere in terms of what it expects. Made under the assumption that there can only be one correct way to play. <br>\n<br>\nNow, if on the other hand, the presentation of the material given to us above is slanted, then maybe it's not that bad. Nobody disagrees that a pure dungeon crawling game can't be loads of fun. But there is a problem if the game uses ridiculing the players as the method to get them to understand it's play goals.

Again, all sorts of games demand different setups. Some will have incentive built in the characters, others won't. <br/><br/>This was just terrible design for AD&amp;D. Find someone who doesn't know anything about roleplaying, offer him this box to play with some beginner friends and ask him if you can sit in a corner and not say anything. See how things will go. <br/><br/>From the perspective of beginners, this is pretty weird. There must have been quite a few people disappointed when they realised they couldn't visit the town. <br/><br/>There is also one key issue: essentially, the GM is overstepping into the shoes of the players by essentially taking control of their characters. "You spend many hours at the tavern and nothing happens. So? Do you go to the tower?". While few players will pick this up consciously, this still begs the question: Why are you deciding for character here? <br/><br/>Imagine an hour later. The adventurers are in the dungeon. <br/><br/>GM: "There's a door in front, do you open it?"<br/>Player: "Well why don't you step into my character's shoes and tell me what happens, smartass?"<br/><br/>There's this way of handling characters that is simply not built in AD&amp;D. The game is designed for players to control a character and is ill-equiped to share it.<br/><br/>In short, I strongly disagree with you. Not only is this not a fine intro to roleplaying, it's possibly one of the worse thing I have EVER seen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

When you play this adventure, you should make it clear that this is an adventure about going on this quest.  Make sure the players know this, and make sure everyone is on board.  Just like when you play Monopoly, everyone is on board with playing a haphazard model of being a real estate mogul, this is about going to Nethril's Tower."<br/><br/>That bit about basically baiting them with boredom till they surrender.  That's bullshit.  The bit where the GM doesn't just explicitly tell them what is going on, but instead uses these grotesque methods of having the group Ouija Board the GM's expectations is gross.<br/><br/>The problem is <i>not</i> that there's an adventure to be had.  If that's the fun everyone wants, <i>that's great</i>!<br/><br/>The problem is these damnable tactics of human beings sitting around a table and not talking.  That's just <i>gross</i>.  And I mean exactly that. Gross.  It's grotesque.  The notion that the GM is actually putting choices to another person where there is not choice is grotesque.  The idea that there's no choice and this simply isn't made explicit is grotesque.<br/><br/>Again, it's <i>not</i> that there's a pre-planned adventure.  It's that the instructions are about not making this fact explicit.  It's that the book is telling the GM, "By the way, don't tell them this.  Fuck with 'em till they get the idea."<br/><br/>It's not explicit at all about what's going on.  It's the complete opposite.<br/><br/>We've spent years not talking to each other at the gaming table. I understand that's how it was.  But the idea that anyone would show up to defend jerking the players around instead of just saying <i>what fucking needs to be said</i> to communicate clearly confounds me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Gardiner" title="Chris Gardiner"><img alt="Chris Gardiner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Gardiner">Chris Gardiner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98623/#Comment_98623" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T10:14:49+00:00" title="September 24, 2007 10:14AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah - if nothing happens unless they follow the town crier, why not just start them following the town crier?

Do they enter?<br/>A: If yes, the adventure begin<br/>B: If no, it rains and it rains and it rains. If they turn back to the road, they (quote) "come to a ravine where the road once was.

The heroes will have to return to the mansion to take shelter."<br/><br/>Question: why not begin the adventure with the last hero to enter the fucking mansion? It could be dramatic, punchy. But no, a false choice once again to begin the adventure. Absolutely no guidelines should the hero insist on not entering the mansion and look elsewhere. It's just a bad setup and leads to dysfunctional behavior. <br/><br/>(There's also some pretty hard choices and heavy railroading in the 2nd adventure, including choices that could lead to intra-party conflicts as well as a choice leading to<i> automatic death</i>.

Feel free to post "none-bashing" thoughts or simply go to a thread you find more interesting, if you like. <br/><br/>FWIW, the Ford Pinto does not influence new cars much.

Except there is, once again, no guidance. You're not told this is an unsubstantial evil, seemingly conniving for the adventurers to get to the mansion. You're not told what to do if they go off the road, or anything. As a beginning DM, you're left on your own.<br/><br/>There's tons of false binary choices like that throughout the adventures.  <br/><br/>I still have <b>Keep on the Borderlands </b>here, the old one. It's written way earlier, with almost no previous examples and yet it's nowhere near as difficult for a beginner DM, IMO. For one thing, the keep is sufficiently detailed. I think it would have done them some good to scrap two adventures, replace one with an engrossing description of the town and replace the other with plenty of DM advice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98674/#Comment_98674" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T11:22:43+00:00" title="September 24, 2007 11:22AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Here is your project: You have to make a game or scenario.

I've heard of people driving Ford Pintos - in fact I owned one, hence why I use the example. But I've never heard of anyone playing this product. I'm betting as a product it tanked horribly, even by indie standards (much less the much higher WotC standards). I doubt that it has influcenced hardly any players at all. As for GM's who ran it, I wonder how many of them managed to figure out the flaws, and as they do with so many poorly produced modules, managed somehow to salvage something from the game. Again, for those few who actually played the game. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for what the authors (pretty prominent in the D&amp;D world, Cook and Nesmith), have produced outside of this, I can't recall another module produced in this format. And I do think that the format is key here. Consider that Zeb Cook pretty much fell off the face of the earth after producing this, and has only since resurfaced working for Green Ronin - who's products seem to generally be better than the one under discussion. Pior to that he was the author of many of the modules of the sort you're refering to with Keep on the Borderlands. Not that one specifically, but he did the slaver modules, for instance, which are quite clear about where the characters start (as competition modules, in fact). <br/>\n<br/>\nLastly nobody does have a varying opinion here - that was what my first post was saying. I think only you have the module in front of you at the moment. We'll take your word for it that it's bad. Not because it's forcing play to start at the dungeon, but because of the methods you're saying it uses. The only quibble that people are having is that they're defending the "direct to dungeon" style of play. Which you're not bashing, I take it, right? So there's no controversy. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust offering my perspective.

I don't really understand why that's the case and don't think it's very cool of you. There is no "we'll take your word for it". It's just *you* expressing doubts here, Mike. If others have doubts, they can speak for themselves.<br/><br/>Just so you know, I don't make stuff up. I don't see what I'd gain from doing that. Anyway, I look forward to further conversations with you in this or any other thread. I'm just a bit annoyed because this thread looks relevant to me and aside from yourself, nobody seems to have a problem with it.

The CD is there because he can't do the voice acting or the scene descriptions yet (he's 13 remember), he wouldn't know what do if you start a fight, the game doesn't have the rules for that. Improvisation is a skill that needs to be learn. I'm fine at it now but I sucked when I was a teenager. Any game I didn't prepare in meticulous detail beforehand went down the pan. <br/><br/>Sure the game handles the railroading badly, but I understand why its there and has to be there.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Have you ever heard of anyone actually playing this product?</blockquote>\nI think that would be me, about 5 posts earlier?<br/><br/>For the record if this is the game that I have the CD from at home then I would totally recommend that any gamer with a sense of humor pick it up, just to listen to the horrendous voice acting, it is worth it for that alone.

Most roleplaying games have some form of it. This example of railroading I didn't find particularly creative but that's not my issue.<br/><br/>I think I've identified my problem. I don't know how to put it into words exactly. But it's the fact the DM is literally taking control of the entire universe, including time and the player characters: <b>"You go back to the tavern and wait several hours"</b><br/>AD&amp;D was just not meant to be played that way. As written, the game directly encourages the DM to take control of the characters, and without any form of explicit or even implicit agreement, have hours pass by. Even worse, the actual narrative of events make them feel like losers. They're actually sitting on their asses doing nothing. Might have had some redeeming value if they had been talking to peasants about heroic deeds or something. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Justin D. Jacobson</cite>The alternatives posited in this thread don't sound any better to me:<br/><br/>1) "Just start with the PCs, e.g., following the town crier." Sure that works for this adventure as one shot, but how does the GM link adventures into a campaign? This advice doesn't address that issue.<br/><br/>2) "Just communicate directly with the players, e.g., 'You guys need to follow the town crier to get to the place where the real adventure is.'" That solution breaks character, which I think is a downer for some groups and certainly wasn't in the mindset of 80's D&amp;D design.<br/><br/>So, per Andy's suggestion, put yourself in the designer's shoes: What would you do to teach newbie GMs how to get the PCs on the adventure track?</blockquote>\nI like alternative <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>. It doesn't teach a DM how to pace things, fade to black or be creative. But at least it doesn't violate the relationship between a player and his character in AD&amp;D (I'm struggling with words here, I prefer the term "appartenance" in French). <br/><br/>I agree that the 2nd solution might not always be appropriate. How about giving players more hints and more incentives? I seem to remember that several adventures had those. <br/><br/>If player don't proceed to X, do A, which should lead them to do X<br/>If they don't do A, do B, which should lead them to do A or X<br/>If they don't B, do C, which should lead them to do A, B or X<br/><br/>Of course, we're still in the realm of railroading. Had they invested in one less adventure, they could have built a town and let the players explore it, and have plenty incentives to go adventuring. Or just stay in town and have a good time. <br/><br/>Part of a beginner's product should probably be about behavior, what people collectively agree to do, how to make everybody feel good. In the end, I feel this product doesn't empower anyone. Even though the DM is asked to behave like a powertripping ass, he is given no tools to become a better ref/DM/GM/storyteller.  <br/><br/>The setting should either have been fleshed out, or guidelines should have been written to encourage DM creativity.

I think this is mostly because (by necessity) they use generic rewards instead of personal ones.  Something that was pointed out to me is that giving the reward is important, but perhaps equally important is <i>promising the rewards</i>.  The promise is what gets people to go after them, and shuttles them in whatever direction you intend.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99043/#Comment_99043" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T14:01:32+00:00" title="September 25, 2007  2:01PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To go back to the first post...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Consonant Dude</cite>What the fuck were they thinking?</blockquote>\nWhy didn't they just start the adventure with the start of the action?  I think because we humans have a very ingrained sense of how stories are supposed to go. To whit:<br/><br/>Once Upon a time there was a _____.<br/>And every day _____.<br/>Until one day _____.<br/>And because of that ____.<br/>And because of that ____.<br/>And because of that ____.<br/>Until finally _____.<br/>And ever since that day, _______.<br/>The end.<br/><br/>We're dealing with the transition from "and every day," to "until one day." Graham's talking about this right now over on his blog in <a href="http://www.catchyourhare.com/journal/?p=44" rel="nofollow">this entry</a>. The designer wants to show how the characters are transitioning from "not on an adventure" to "on an adventure," and the method for this transition is the town crier. Now, multimedia authoring is hard, if for no other reason than there isn't a lot of great prior art out there to loot for ideas. There are probably better ways this could have been executed, but I think the thought process behind why the adventure even starts this way at all is understandable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99051/#Comment_99051" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T14:14:35+00:00" title="September 25, 2007  2:14PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben, I agree. And I have absolutely no problem with a game that starts "Once upon a time you guys were following the Town Crier to go fight an evil wizard." <br/><br/>I have a big problem with a game that makes an offer "Do you follow?" which includes the offer "...or not?" and then punishes the player until he takes choice 1. My problem is intensified by "ok, you sit in the Inn and do nothing for several hours." How did he suddenly get narrative control of my character? Did he roll secret dice or something? Can he do that elsegame, like say in the middle of a battle with the evil wizard dude? "Um...ok, so he comes at you and your scared so I'm just going to say you hesitate here and he gets like 2 free hits. Cool, and then you're off balance from the attack so, you take a -1 penalty on attack in round three..."<br/><br/>I played D&amp;D when I was 13 and we played some pretty idiotic games, but I would have had the same reaction back then. "This is lame. I wouldn't sit doing nothing in an inn. I would do x" and as soon as he gave me back my character that's where I'd be headed. Maybe I'd try to assassinate the town crier, maybe I'd try to rob the innkeeper. <br/><br/>It's not that I'm a dick player who bristles at the thought of any railroading. I'll go where you point me, but they just gotta point me and say "that way lies story." A game that institutionalizes pee-pee wacking your players at an early age seems poorly thought out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone" title="Quintin Stone"><img alt="Quintin Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://rps.net/QS/Images/pipboy-32x32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone">Quintin Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99059/#Comment_99059" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T14:42:00+00:00" title="September 25, 2007  2:42PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a fairly reactive group.

I've given you how I feel about the subject. How that constitutes me trying to force people to do things... especially when I have no power to do so... well I don't get it. <br/>\n<br/>\n2. I never said your observations were innacurate, but simply that anyone who jumps on the bandwagon (either way) without checking it out for themselves, isn't really being analytical. It's easy to agree with somebody else's opinion of something, and then find out that when you experience that thing for yourself, that your experience of it is different. I'm saying that if people really want to know how good or bad it is, they should check it out for themselves. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf people don't feel the need to check the product out itself, well, as I've said, I think that this only points out how irrellevant this thread really is. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf what we're saying here is "Railroading is Bad Design!" well all I can say is that this is neither new information, nor controversial in any way. <br/>\n<br/>\nI mean... this thread largely reads to me like, "Look, Nazis! They're bad!"<br/>\n<br/>\nLike I say, man, just my perspective. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4367/are-you-following-the-fin-town-cryer-already" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4367/are-you-following-the-fin-town-cryer-already" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4367/are-you-following-the-fin-town-cryer-already/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F4367%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F4367%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
