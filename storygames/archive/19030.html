Below, I open it up to Classic <i>Traveller</i> skills in general.]<br/><br/>The Classic <i>Traveller</i> resolution is skill based. There a list of skills. The skills are written up like this:\n<blockquote><b>MECHANICAL</b>: The individual has skill in the use, operation, and repair of mechanical devices. The person is considered to be handy in this field, with a talent similar to that of a green thumb. This skill specifically excludes the field of engineering; it does include non-energy weapon repair.<br/>Many of the devices of civilization are strictly mechanical in nature, and the need to repair, replace, or simply use them pervades life. Mechanical expertise allows a character<br/>the ability to operate mechanical devices easily, as well as to repair them quickly and efficiently. Any situation requiring a knowledge of mechanical aspects of devices or equipment can be affected by mechanical skill.<br/><br/><b>Referee</b>: Specific throws for specific situations must be generated. Obviously, the throw to fabricate a new main drive bearing as a starship plunges into a flaming sun would be harder than the throw to repair a broken air lock hatch while in port. Success in any mechanical enterprise is also affected by such variables as tool availability, personal strength and dexterity, education, and situation.</blockquote>\nOr this:\n<blockquote><b>ADMINISTRATION</b>: The individual has had experience with bureaucratic agencies, and understands the requirements of dealing with them and managing them.<br/><br/>When contact with officials is required, understanding their needs and motives will assist in dealing with them. A basic throw of 7+ will successfully resolve normal interaction without further problems (such as avoidance of police harrassment, insuring prompt issuance of licenses, approval of applications, avoidance of close inspection of papers, etc). DMs to be applied: no expertise, - 3; per level of admin expertise, +2.<br/><br/>When serving in a bureaucratic organization, admin expertise allows competency in the eyes of superiors. DMs to be applied: +1 per level of expertise. The exact throw to be determined by the referee under the circumstances.<br/><br/><b>Referee</b>: Admin expertise should also affect the quality of work and potential of success for an organization which the character is controlling or managing.</blockquote>\nA couple of things: There are Characteristics in the game (Strength, Dexterity, Endurance, Intelligence, Education, Social Standing) which are kind of forgotten after character creation. And over the years many folks have tried lots of tweaks to make the skills use more uniform, inform the rolls more logically and so forth.<br/><br/>But, basically, the GM sets a difficulty number, the player rolls 2D6 + Skill modifiers. He hits the number to succeed.<br/><br/>In other words, it's straight up skill checks. And I'm not really fond of straight up skill checks. I like the feeling that the Character is working against someone or something -- not just rolling against himself. I also find  simply setting a skill number and rolling kind of dry.<br/><br/>So working off <a href="http://www.freelancetraveller.com/features/rules/travellinglight.html" rel="nofollow">a skill check variant I found online</a>, here's what I'm going to try:<br/><br/><b>The Need to Make a Roll</b><br/>When do you roll? When something is at stake, conflict is on the table, and the outcome is uncertain.<br/><br/>If the use of the skill is something that the Character could probably handle given his skill and background, there's no need to make a roll. For this reason, few skill checks will ever start at Easy or Moderate. There's little point in making a roll that the Character should be expected to make in average circumstances.<br/><br/><b>Referee Decision Making</b><br/>As with most CT task checks, the player will be rolling 2D and must try to equal or exceed a target number created by the referee. The referee decides on the difficulty of the task on a scale from easy to virtually impossible. He rolls 2D with the appropriate modifier based on the difficulty. This provides the "Rolled Difficulty."<br/><br/>Easy: 2D-4<br/>Moderate: 2D<br/>Difficult: 2D+2<br/>Formidable: 2D+6<br/>Virtually Impossible: 2D+8<br/><br/>This provides a bit more elasticity in results, as the target number is weighted along the difficulty scale with averages of 3, 7, 9, 13, and 15 respectively. But it provides elasticity to the results: with two random numbers being rolled, everyone has to lean to the dice to see who rolled what and compare. I like that.<br/><br/>I also like the fact the Character is not rolling against his own skill. He's rolling against the circumstances of the fiction. If he's trying to get an airlock door open, he's now rolling against the fictional details of that airlock: The make, the model, the tools he's got fitting or not fitting, the ship's AI realizing it's being breached and overriding with a new code, and whatever.<br/><br/><i>[The bit with the referee making a 2D roll plus modifier is the part I am specifically curious about. Normally in Traveller the GM just sets a difficulty number along a range of values. I'm adding the weight dice rolls for the opposition, for reasons listed above. Does this work for people? Is it crazy in some way?]</i><br/><br/><b>Positive DMs</b><br/>Next the player rolls the 2D and adds the value of the relevant skill. <br/><br/>He also gains a bonus of +1 if his relevant characteristic equals or exceeds rolled task difficulty. In fact, if his characteristic is double the rolled difficulty, then he gains a DM of +2 instead! When the DMs are added up, a result equal to or exceeding the referee\u2019s difficulty number is a success\u2014just like in Book One.<br/><br/><b>Unskilled Penalties</b><br/>Many of the skill descriptions in Book One give hefty penalties for attempting a task while untrained (i.e. with no relevant skill levels). Default skills are those skills that the characters are assumed to be familiar with if not fully trained, skills like Vacc Suit, weapon skills, ground car, etc. As in Book One, default skill gives a DM of 0.<br/><br/>For other skills the referee must decide on their value (how rare or specialized they are). Is that skill you\u2019ve requested fairly common, or is it rare? Examples of the first might be Steward, Electronics, or ATV (skills quite familiar to most characters through everyday experiences). Examples of the second include Engineering, Pilot, Forward Observer, Streetwise, Leadership, and so on (specialized skills requiring specific education or experiences to understand and attempt).<br/><br/>Apply a DM of -2 for lack of a common skill<br/>Apply a DM of -4 for lack of a specialized skill<br/><br/><b>Using Two Skills in Combination</b><br/>Some tasks call for skill in two different areas. Turning a missile into a drone might require both Gunnery and Electronics. If the referee calls for two skills that must both be possessed, then he must also double the difficulty he just set and allow the main skill to add a DM of +2 to per skill level, and the secondary skill to add the usual +1 per skill level. If the character lacks just one of the two required skills then assume to be at a default level for this task (receiving no untrained penalty). If you lack both required skills then you receive only one untrained penalty (whichever is the harshest). For example, if Pilot and Vacc Suit are required, you'd get a -4 penalty for having neither skill, not the full -6.<br/><br/><b>Fictional Positioning</b><br/>The more the Player works and pushes on the fictional situation, the more he can improve his chance of success. Just like OD&amp;D, the Players are encouraged to create work-arounds the need to roll. Making a roll means you might fail! So, avoid them if you can! And if you can't avoid them, add color and details to the Character's circumstances to improve, fictionally, the Character's odds. What is the Character doing? How is the Character doing it? As the Details get added, the GM knocks down the Difficulty one or more levels. <br/><br/>[<i>This last part is something I'm adding as well.

Instead of rolling 2d6 we are rolling 2d6-2d6, which increases both bell curve height and extreme values, but does little else. Aesthetics are of course aesthetics, I don't want to go against that; I don't myself feel like having the GM roll for "the semiconductor chip resisting your attempts to fix it" is an elegant touchpoint between the mechanics and the fiction, but some do feel otherwise. It's also questionable conceptually whether a task resolution system should have a random factor in the difficulties like that - does it mean that the GM doesn't know or doesn't care to determine how difficult this task is, exactly, or what is it that we're attempting to gain here conceptually?<br/><br/>I like how you bring the Characteristics into the system, it's mathematically interesting. However, it's also quite a bit of handling time; unless you're literally intending to abstract the system into a conflict-resolution system (instead of a task resolution system, which it used to be), and thus reduce the amount of rolling by a magnitude, that's likely too much rolling and comparing and calculating bonuses.<br/><br/>That mechanical solution for using two skills in combination is convoluted as hell from my viewpoint. It is possible that e.g. a Traveller background might make that seem really pleasing and elegant because the game uses similar hijinks in other parts, or whatever, but for me as a Traveller-outsider that doesn't parse as anything I'd want to use. Have you considered something simpler, there are plenty of ways that this particular conceptual issue has been resolved in rpg history. For the sake of the example: determine difficulty normally and roll against it with the primary skill relevant to the task; if the secondary skill is more than half the value of the primary skill, add +2 to the result.<br/><br/>In general your logic here straddles the fence between a robust task resolution system and a robust conflict resolution system in a way that I find uncomfortable; I understand how to utilize a good task resolution system e.g. as a part of a conflict resolution procedure, and I understand the value of a system that resolves conflicts explicitly, but this one feels like it's neither a fish nor a fowl: on the one hand randomized difficulties and formalized unskilled penalties scream "abstract conflict resolution system", but then again the text clearly concerns resolving individual tasks. How is the logical gap between a task and a conflict crossed here, aside from the ideal that task resolutions should only be made when a conflict is also up in the air?<br/><br/>(In case that question is not entirely clear, an example: in some games that utilize task resolution to resolve conflicts we first determine the <i>stakes</i> of the conflict so we are being explicit and clear about the creative interest the group has in the scene, then we determine the <i>turning-point</i> task on which it all hinges, then we resolve that turning-point task, and creatively assume that all the other minor details of the scene fall out in a way that accords with the results of that individual task resolution. <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> is a schoolbook example of this type of conflict-resolution-via-task-resolution.)<br/><br/>We can also discuss alternative treatments if you'd like, but I won't go into them now in case you're already committed to these particular concepts and are just looking for minor fine-tuning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gnome_Inventor" title="Gnome_Inventor"><img alt="Gnome_Inventor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gnome_Inventor">Gnome_Inventor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424948/#Comment_424948" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-29T00:40:36+00:00" title="November 29, 2013 12:40AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mathematically I think 2d6-2d6 is equivalent of 4d6 so you're raising the variance and making skill rolls a bit more chancy (though I'm not really sure how much more by without running the numbers for it). Fiction wise I'd normally interpret the roll as including circumstance factors, so this does have some implications as to how success/failure is described e.g. a low roll on the player's dice would be interpreted as the PC failing due to their own ineptitude. On the other hand perhaps the opposed roll would be useful in a group situation -if everyone then rolls against the same difficulty from the GM then at least there are some cases where the mechanic is different to just rolling 4d6.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424956/#Comment_424956" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-29T08:28:22+00:00" title="November 29, 2013  8:28AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2013 8:46AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the feedback!<br/><br/>I appreciate the comments --and they pretty much line up with my own concerns about this fish/fowl concoction. I'm not committed to these notions at all -- as you'll see in the post below.<br/><br/>Like the OSR threads I started, part of what this post was about was my finding my way through many construal ideas I've taken to heart and have really come to understand over the years and toward ways of playing/thinking I haven't used for a while. Honestly, Task-based resolution makes me antsy these days because I'm not used to it.. So I'm trying to contort one kind of system into something else. On the other hand, I'm intrigued with playing games I haven't played for a while and seeing what happens when I play them. And/Or, more importantly, <i>learn</i> to play them.<br/><br/>To be clear, the rolled opposition doesn't mean that I don't care about the difficulty. The modifiers clearly affect the odds -- even if they do add more wacky elasticity. But they also are a way -- in the way Eero and I had a brief exchange about Random Tables for OD&amp;D -- of taking some of the onus off the GM. (At least as I saw it.) "Yes, the odds are against you by <i>this</i> much. But let's find out what the fates decide." I'm not saying it's ultimately a good idea, and I'm already removing it.<br/><br/>By the way, I think one takes away the opposed roll from the process (which I added to the house rules I found), the attribute modifier isn't that much extra time. The Difficulties become 3, 7, 9, 13, 15. If the applicable characteristic is greater than the value, you get a +1, if double +2. I don't think it would be a problem with that structure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424958/#Comment_424958" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-29T09:21:14+00:00" title="November 29, 2013  9:21AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Digging into the rules, I find I'm reading them with an eye I did not posses when I was 17. (Good!)<br/><br/>So, let's examine Classic Traveller skill resolution as it stands.<br/><br/>Here are things I find:\n<blockquote><b>ELECTRONICS</b>: The individual has skill in the use, operation, and repair of electronic devices. The person is considered handy in<br/>this field, with the equivalent of a green thumb talent. This skill includes the repair of energy weapons. An advanced technological civilization depends heavily on the use of electronic devices. The need to use, repair, and replace electronic devices is ubiquitous.<br/>Electronic expertise allows a character to use and operate electronic items; generally the skill is a DM applied to the throw to understand, repair, assemble, or operate. Complex items would also require a certain level of education or a very high intelligence; many devices may also require some degree of dexterity. <br/><br/><b>Referee</b>: Specific throws for specific situations must be generated. Obviously, some throws will be harder than others, and many will be impossible without an accumulation of DMs based on expertise, education, dexterity, intelligence, and the availability of parts and tools.</blockquote>\nLook at how many variables the referee is responsible for adjudicating! How does the referee judge the specific throws? Which DMs should be applied for expertise, education, dexterity, intelligence? Given that some skills are described as giving DMs of +1 per skill level while others are a +2 per skill level, exactly how crazy making is this? <br/><br/>Or does it actually work? The referee, along with the players, sort of figure out the right throw to be made, bringing to bear the appropriate DMs? I'm assuming this is why everyone has been trying to reconfigure the skill system for years. But like looking at OD&amp;D fresh, maybe it does work as is. (In other words, you don't change the starting HPs for a character in D&amp;D because it makes them too fragile -- because the point is they're supposed to be fragile.)<br/><br/>And this, in the Self Improvement section of the rules:\n<blockquote><b>Education</b>: A character with an education characteristic lower than his or her intelligence characteristic may improve education level through the use of correspondence courses and tutoring. In general such courses (or tutors) have a base price of CR 50 per week. Generally one session per week is taken, though 2 per week are possible. After 50 sessions are completed the character's education level is increased by one. In one four year period, it is possible to increase the education characteristic a maximum of 6 levels.<br/><br/>Education increases gained are permanent.<br/><br/>In addition, any character may, once during his or her life, take a sabbatical (for 4 years) for the purpose of specifically gaining a skill through education. Such activity is the equivalent of a technical school or college education, and allows the acquisition of one specific non-weapon skill with a level of 2. Cost of this education is CR 70,000.</blockquote>\nSo, clearly education is supposed to matter. But, again, in the rules how education is supposed to apply is never defined more clearly than in the Electronics rule above. Again, it seems as if the group at the table is supposed to (expected to? have to?) grope their way toward a method of determining the process for resolving task rolls -- whatever their nature. <br/><br/>There are 2D6. There are characteristics, skills, and fictional circumstances. And the referee (along with input from the players) has to cobble together the throw and the DMs on an almost case by case basis.<br/><br/>Has anyone worked games like this? How do they play? Do they work? Part of me can't imagine they do. Other parts of me imagine that the only way they can work is if the players add the bits of fiction/color to add in the DMs they want to help them succeed. Which is cool!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424959/#Comment_424959" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-29T10:03:22+00:00" title="November 29, 2013 10:03AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It occurs to me that having a complex system of modifiers for various situations - of which actually having skill count to different degrees in different situations is one <i>extreme</i> example - could be good if you've got a table that is honestly interested in correctly factoring the difficulties. Our D&amp;D table is like this, for example: when we settle down to figure out how e.g. a given combat goes, everybody is doing their best to apply the rules correctly and communicate the fiction well to make the resolution accord with it. The opposite type of table would be one where a Doylean interpretation of the fiction reigns, all modifiers to checks only stand on the strength of GM fiat, and players <i>lie</i> to get better odds. "Of course my character was standing here, in this beneficial spot."<br/><br/>Even if you're not afraid of the latter type of group, it is worthwhile to consider handling time and system elegance. We make this stuff work on D&amp;D via "rulings, not rules", which reduces handling time to exactly whatever amount we find desirable on a case-by-case basis. A group that wants a firm set of rules is stuck checking the rule book every time for whether you were supposed to get double bonuses from this skill in this situation or not.<br/><br/>Looking at what you've presented here in terms of tools (I'm not familiar with Traveller, although I probably should look into it - looks interesting), my own inclination would be to clarify how difficulties are set, determine a few standard ways that roll bonuses are derived, and then leave the rest up to an OSR-like common law process.<br/><br/>What I say about setting difficulties is something very specific: I don't think that a trad rpg "difficulty table" is useful at all. Having a table that tells you what an "easy" or "moderate" task is numerically is a subtle tool of trad gamemastering, as it relates task difficulty to supposed proper character skill numbers instead of anything observable in the fiction. If I was considering an old school game (and note, I don't know if you want Traveller to be that, maybe you want it to be new school), I would for hygienic reasons attempt to discover sharper and more objective tools for this crucial part of the equation.<br/><br/>As an example of what I mean, I'll tell how I deal with setting difficulties in my D&amp;D homebrew: a task at difficulty 20 is moderately challenging for a demographically average human without special skills, such that they are equally likely to fail or succeed. Difficulty 30 is a task that is practically impossible without talent or training. Difficulty 10 should be automatic success for everybody in ordinary situations. These are fictional touchpoints against which individual tasks are evaluated, so that their difficulties may well end up in between these numbers - I usually use 5-point increments. Almost all difficulties can be established well with these simple touchpoints.<br/><br/>That might seem like almost the same as the difficulty table you presented, but there is a crucial difference: I can be called on my numbers because they are defined by fictional benchmarks instead of likelihood of PC success (which is what these "medium difficulty task" type lists really amount to), and players can double-check them easily enough. Is the task I'm trying here <i>really</i> so difficult that it deserves DC 25? I would have said that almost anybody can do this thing reliably all the time, so why is the GM giving me such a hard time? I better ask him to show his work - explain the logic of the decision and draw my attention to the fictional details upon which he determined that number.<br/><br/>Developing the theme of setting difficulties, regarding randomized difficulties: I understand the notion of providing for random detail by randomizing resistances in resolution, but I don't think that this is the best approach for doing that in a task resolution game. (It could be good for a conflict resolution system, many such use it successfully - just look at HeroQuest!) The problem is that you do not know at this stage how elaborate the fictional details concerning individual tasks in the game actually are going to be. When a character is trying to jury-rig a broken computer, it's all well and good to randomize how badly the computer is broken, and determine difficulty on that basis. However, what if we already know that the computer's power source is broken, but the computer is otherwise fine? We could well know this before setting the difficulty has ever come up, assuming that we're playing with organic task resolution procedure. Is it really fair to randomize the difficulty in a situation where we know perfectly well how difficult the task is in fictional terms? I would say no, and would rather use real benchmarking of some sort to determine the difficulty.<br/><br/>Putting the difficulty side of the equation aside for a moment, I'd like to speculate a bit about how the system might be pushed. Am I correct in assuming that the 2d6 is a cornerstone mechanic that should be retained, no matter what? (In my OSR musings I call the mechanics that I want to retain for aesthetic and historical reasons "cornerstones".) How about the dice + skill against DC formulation, is that also a cornerstone that cannot be abandoned? The Characteristics and Skills are surely cornerstones, the system has to use those purposefully for it to make any sense as a revised Traveller skill system.<br/><br/>I probably do not need to tell you that one thing you could do with these mechanical components is to simply play with <i>Apocalypse World</i> dice mechanics, achieving a robust conflict-resolution-via-task-resolution system with very little work: 2d6 + skill, roll 7+ for partial success and 10+ for total success. -1 for being untrained in the skill, -1 for difficult circumstances, and most circumstances trigger extra checks instead of factoring more modifiers. Roll under the relevant Characteristic to get xp or whatever, there are many ways the Characteristics can be mixed back in once the skill resolution is clear. Of course this would mostly obviate the Traveller skill-specific rules for situational modifiers and such.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424960/#Comment_424960" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-29T10:09:15+00:00" title="November 29, 2013 10:09AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And thinking about it more...<br/><br/>In my youth I know I saw the role of the referee to guide the PCs to challenges to use their Vacc Suit or ATV or Electronic skills... which seemed really dull.<br/><br/>But I do see, now, that the skill list is really just there to say, "Do things kind of like this. These are examples. And when something challenging needs to be tested, then cobble something together."<br/><br/>I originally saw the skill as limiting the options for the PCs. Especially since, for the initiated, the skill are doled out randomly in character creation and the PCs might be built with a rather limited set of skills. <br/><br/>But really, the skills are only a part of how they'll try to get things done -- with the characteristics playing a part as well, as well as the "roleplaying" (adding details, color, fiction as they maneuver and poke the fictional world) to sort out how they want to solve a problem. <br/><br/>This goes back to the Afterward from Book 3 of <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i>:\n<blockquote>There are unquestionably areas which have been glossed over.

Is the task I'm trying here really so difficult that it deserves DC 25? I would have said that almost anybody can do this thing reliably all the time, so why is the GM giving me such a hard time? I better ask him to show his work - explain the logic of the decision and draw my attention to the fictional details upon which he determined that number</blockquote>\nI think it is important that in <i>Traveller</i> the GM is explicitly referred to as a "referee." <br/><br/>Not only is this a distinctly different connotation, it draws specifically from the historical/miniature/war game roots of RPGs that Bob covered in his <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19020/pre-os-why-dd-kicked-ass-as-a-wargame-and-why-those-wierd-early-rules-exist" rel="nofollow">OSR/History thread.</a><br/><br/>Looking at the quote above in many ways the players are working hand-in-hand with the referee. In fact, if you squint and look at it a certain way, the players are setting their own target and DMs, making their case to themselves and fellow players by talking it out loud. The referee, in the miniature war gene sense of referee, thinks upon the statements (fictional elements meeting mechanics) offering judgment, suggestions, discussion. It's almost the opposite of how we normally see the process between GM/Players in trad games.<br/><br/>Of course, the process goes both ways. As you say above, the referee can make a judgement and the player can question it in turn. But the point stands that in many ways the players are creating their own challenge in this kind if play and referee is there to provide pushback/more things to think about. The referee can provoke more thought and fictional color than the players might think if in their own as well as more "fog of world" to crest more tension, mystery, and sense of "world" beyond the PCs.<br/><br/>What I find fascinating, in regard to all this, is that the Classic <i>Traveller</i> text assumes one can play the game "solitaire" -- either  alone or with the players all playing PCs. But that the game is "better" with a referee. I think this lines up very much with the spirit (but not the letter) of adjudication described in the quote above.\n<blockquote>These game rules are as complete as they could be and provide for solitaire and unsupervised play. But the main thrust of the game is the refereed or umpired situation. An independent referee allows a large degree of flexibility and continuity often not possible when players themselves control the game. A referee inserts some measure of uncertainty in the minds of the players as they travel through the universe. Finally, the referee deals with new situations that these rules may not cover; after all, no set of rules can totally define the universe and how it works.<br/>-- Traveller Book 1</blockquote>\nFinally, Eero, if you're interested in Classic Traveller, RPGNow is offering Starter Traveller for free. It's a tweaked version of the original 3 Traveller books. There is some text variation. However, Traveller Books 1, 2, and 3 really is the way you want to go. It really does strike me that GDW took a lot of cues from the Original Dungeons &amp; Dragons and that quality is baked most clearly in those original three books.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424966/#Comment_424966" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-29T11:59:03+00:00" title="November 29, 2013 11:59AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2013 12:24PM by John_Harper.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (cross-posted with Christopher, above)<br/><br/>My own experience with this kind of thing (mostly through <i>Stars Without Number</i> and <i>World of Dungeons</i>) aligns with Eero's.<br/><br/>The process of determining a difficulty number or deciding when to roll or determining the stakes of a given roll are all done by interrogating the fiction for the necessary details. This also involves making judgment calls, which serve two purposes: 1) They make the game unique to our group since our judgment calls are specifically our own and reflect the aesthetics, values, and preferences of our group. And 2) They allow us to adapt a simple mechanism to an infinite variety of fictional details and situations, without accounting for all of them exhaustively <i>a priori</i>.<br/><br/>Since it's the GM's chief job to understand and present the fictional space as accurately as possible, setting a target number or calling for a roll is a wonderful opportunity to do just that. Like Eero says, DCs that are based on fictional qualities become another tool for better describing the world. They're a game tool that represents an in-fiction thing -- when my character looks at that DC 20 wall, she knows that she should ask one of the skilled climbers in the group to tackle it.<br/><br/>This also means getting rid of the notion that more dangerous or consequential things must be more difficult to accomplish. The fictional state determines these things, not our notions of how the situation "should" be. Avoiding the death gaze of the monster might be absurdly simple if you know the trick and thus a very low DC (or, in a "roll under your stat" system, only calling for a roll in extreme circumstances), but the stakes are still very high. Setting the stakes and difficulty independently based on the fiction is a powerful tool that makes all the hijinks of fictional positioning come into play.<br/><br/>(Edited to add, for completeness sake: The reverse is also true. Sometimes things of very little consequence can be extremely difficult to accomplish. By changing their fictional positioning, players can try to manipulate the various resolution components -- achievement, danger, difficulty).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424969/#Comment_424969" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-29T12:15:43+00:00" title="November 29, 2013 12:15PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>1) They make the game unique to our group since our judgment calls are specifically our own and reflect the aesthetics, values, and preferences of our group.</blockquote>\nI see this as the core, utter charm of this sort of play -- using that word in its most utter naive and compelling way.\n<blockquote>This also means getting rid of the notion that more dangerous or consequential things must be more difficult to accomplish.

How does one do that on the fly? I still don't know. My brain melted. But when I look at the rules through Eero's challenge based play the whole thing falls into place. And, to be explicit: The "challenge" doesn't come from modeling the "reality" of the situation (because, it's five guys sitting around a table) but by using the fictional elements to create challenges that engage the five guys sitting around the table.<br/><br/>As for the combat -- I'll keep that as well. As I noted in the blog post linked to in the OP above I have also picked up some rules for miniature space combat and ground combat.

It's kind of strange -- in a good way! <br/><br/>Before encounters begin you roll to see if either party has the drop on the other (maybe one does, maybe both spot each other at once, maybe neither do). Then you roll to see at what range the involved parties are at with mods for terrain (in a building you're more likely to spot each other at Close or Short range than Medium, for example). Surprise attacks are allowed until something happens to alert the unaware group. Or the group with the drop can try to move on without being spotted. Once the other side is aware of an attack, you go into standard combat phases.<br/><br/>There are four choices for movement at the start of a round (Stand Ground, Close Range, Open Range, Evade). Then everyone announces attacks (attacks are only viable if you stood ground). All movement happens simultaneously and then all combat happens simultaneously. There's no initiative at all. <br/><br/>I'm assuming then, that there is a Free and Clear stage, like <i>Sorcerer</i>, where everyone gets to announce what they want to do in each of those phases, and then change their announcements as other people make their announcements. <br/><br/>And I can assure you that Adolescent Me had no idea what to make of this. If everyone can announce at the same time and everyone takes action at the same time how do you herd these cats? Again, given age and other games under my belt it all makes sense now (and seems cool).<br/><br/>Also, the rules use what are called Range Bands. You use a lined sheet of paper to mark each characters relative <i>distance</i> to each other (not position, just distance) with the characters marked in the bands between the lines.<br/><br/>So you get this:<br/><br/>RANGE BANDS<br/>Close, Short: 0<br/>Medium: 1 to 2<br/>Long: 3 to 10<br/>Very Long: 11 to 20<br/><br/>This matters since different weapons have different effectiveness at different ranges. And, of course, you need to be at Close range to get to someone with your fist or knife.<br/><br/>The thing is, Adolescent Me looked at this and kept seeing stand up fights. Which had no color and was dull. But the fun comes in when you actual add positioning and terrain. While the lined sheet of paper is efficient, a wipeable hex map (with one each equalling one band) where you can draw terrain and allow cover, flanking and stuff is really where this kind of challenged based play is going to shine.<br/><br/>Again, there are abstractions in the system that need to be unfold to concrete color and situation that is not provided. I think that's why OD&amp;D spawned, in part, the Tolkien-Pulp-Fantasy-Kluge. It was the concrete imagery people had. Instead of saying, "Oh, what don't I see that I want to see, and how do I use this loose tool set to make that?" people grabbed onto the color that already had rules stapled onto them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425018/#Comment_425018" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-30T17:20:40+00:00" title="November 30, 2013  5:20PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 30, 2013 5:22PM by David_Berg.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>1) They make the game unique to our group since our judgment calls are specifically our own and reflect the aesthetics, values, and preferences of our group.</blockquote>\nI see this as the core, utter charm of this sort of play -- using that word in its most utter naive and compelling way.\n<blockquote>This also means getting rid of the notion that more dangerous or consequential things must be more difficult to accomplish.

If you have, and this thread is just about resolving to play <i>Traveller</i> that way, then what I'm about to say is probably old news.  If not, though, hopefully this will be useful to you.<br/><br/>When consulting the fiction for answers to (e.g.) "what should the difficulty be", there are a bunch of steps where the group can either cohere or flounder, and I've found that it's super important to have (1) a rationale for the process, and (2) some consistency in the process itself.  <br/><br/>1) That whole "reflect our aesthetics, values, and preferences" can be united or contentious, and in my experience the difference-maker is an up-front statement of intent.  If your group is united in "we consult the fiction only as a reality sim, based on physics and causality and nothing else", then you can create a process for doing that.  Likewise if your group is united in "we consult the fiction through the lens of 'What would be cool in Star Trek', wherein dramatic convenience trumps realism but only as long as nothing is <i>too</i> unrealistic".  I suspect any orientation can work.  The thing that often <i>doesn't</i> work is when one player reads the fiction like a scientist while another player's reading it like a cartoon audience.<br/><br/>2) At some point before the dice are rolled, the GM and each player at the table form ideas about what's happened in the fiction, what possibilities exist, how likely they are, the probable consequences of acting on them, and more.  My ideal is that, before a roll is made, we all communicate on the fictional states and possibilities relevant to the roll, without getting bogged down in other stuff that doesn't matter.  The most efficient way I've found to do this is to have players verify their assessments before committing to actions.  "I'm thinking of jumping onto it.  That'd be, what, difficulty 6?"  The reason many players don't do this is they're afraid the GM will alter the fiction via their response ("It's difficulty 8 because of blah blah new content!"), so just establish that that won't happen in your group, and you should be good.<br/><br/>I hope all this stuff isn't beside the point for this thread; if so, my apologies.  I mention it partly because that's where I look for the answer to "how do we arbitrate this Electronics roll".  Once we agree on what the fiction is and how to read it, the rest is cake.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425045/#Comment_425045" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-02T00:36:55+00:00" title="December  2, 2013 12:36AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 2, 2013 12:44AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi David,<br/><br/>Thanks for this.<br/><br/>As for your concerns: <br/><br/>I have played like this. But never as thoughtfully or upfront as you and the other posters on this thread suggest. Or, more specifically, I've played this way with <i>Sorcerer</i>, or <i>Grey Ranks</i>, <i>Primetime Adventures</i>, or what have you. But the last time I've played what Eero is describing so clearly was years ago back in high school. And that played well by good fortune.<br/><br/>As for <i>Traveller</i> play: a sidebar. <br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, "we consult the fiction only as a reality sim, based on physics and causality and nothing else" is an impossibility. This is my own view, but I think it's a valid one. In the same way I'll always insist that a military shooter is never realistic. Any game involving someone sitting on their couch using their two thumbs and trigger fingers are <i>never</i> playing a game that is "realistic." I don't care how many touchstones from real life are pasted into the graphics, it simply isn't.<br/><br/>In the same way, four or five friends sitting around a table will never have "physics and causality and nothing else." There are many options we do have. But all of them are kinds of fiction, even the ones that "seem" real. (Which is what a Call of Duty might be shooting for).<br/><br/>For the one I want, it will be a mix of Competency Porn (like the tv series <i>Strikeback</i>) with a patina of SF fantastic mixed with grounded really (<i>Dune</i> leaps to mind, with its sense of wonder but always backed with a fictional logic that grounds and supports the wonder.) This fiction stands in contrast to the logic of, say, <i>Star Wars</i>, where cool trumps all else, or Star Trek, where this week's coolness can be forgotten for next week's coolness. (Contrasting fictional models is part of building the consistent model.) So, we'll make our choices to give the <i>feel</i> of "physics and causality and nothing else." But, in fact, it will not be a simulation of any kind.<br/><br/>My <i>Traveller</i>, then, won't claim to be real. But it will use the fictional and narrative conventions to make it feel real. Again, <i>Dune</i>, seems to be the best model I can think of for what I'd want to be doing. Specifically the Appendices at the back of the book which expands and gives a fictional historical, social, political, and religious context that seems taken from primary sources from within the fictional universe of <i>Dune</i> itself. The appendices seem real and give weight to the context of the fiction, giving the feeling that all that we have read is part of a reality that has physics and is as real as our world in terms of causality in a gun fight. But, of course, it is not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425046/#Comment_425046" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-02T01:11:18+00:00" title="December  2, 2013  1:11AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way I phrase "realism" in the D&amp;D context that we've been doing over the last few years is that we are engaging in a constructive dialogue to discover challenges and solutions; getting things "right" is not important per se, but rather the important thing is to delineate the constraints of the current situation clearly. Thus any given issue of realism (say the penetration capability of a winch-bow against proofed plate mail at 300 feet) is only important insofar as the issue is raised according to procedure at the game table, to be acknowledged and factored into decision-making.<br/><br/>That might sound like exactly the same as traditional realistic simulation, but there is a difference: we do not <i>care</i> about the supposed realism of the way we handle situations, we only care about considering the striking, interesting and mention-worthy aspects of the situation as we perceive it. Realistic considerations are part of the bricolage of constructing a fictional challenge, and there is no necessity or duty to attain a consistent  level of simulation in the way there would be in a game that was truly concerned with realism as a creative goal. I might characterize the difference like this: in a truly realistic game air friction is technically speaking on the table all the time, and it is a procedural error to forget to account for it at any given time; in our challengeful old school D&amp;D air friction is only ever relevant when a player brings it up and it is accepted as relevant on a case-by-case basis, to enhance the tactical complexity of the situation currently under consideration.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most striking technical difference for this distiction that I'm drawing is the "rule of three" that we tend to apply to resolving situations: at most three-ish situational factors will be considered for any given task resolution cycle, so everybody better focus on bringing up the most important factors first so as to not waste time. Although the fictional situation and our understanding of how it would "really" play out is our primary source of material for play, it is only that - material that has to be separately acknowledged, raised on the table, mechanized and resolved as a challenge of decision-making ability, not a challenge of knowledge about real history and physics. Any realistic issues that do not contribute to establishing rich and interesting challenges may as well be constructively ignored on a case-by-case basis, assuming that "it did not become a conclusive factor in this particular engagement". Very different from an attempt at consistent simulation.<br/><br/>I hope the above explains how I can be talking about organic realism on the one hand and refute realism as a creative goal of play on the other. There are differences, although I will say that old school D&amp;D the way we play it (that is, strictly fiction-first) goes as far towards realistic considerations in its creative interests as it is possible to do while actually having a gamist creative agenda.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425056/#Comment_425056" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-02T08:56:18+00:00" title="December  2, 2013  8:56AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 2, 2013 12:30PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, <br/><br/>I'm not sure if this is the phrasing you'd use, but this is in my head and seems consistent with what has been discussed over the last couple of weeks:<br/><br/>Each challenge for your group seems to be a unique puzzle or board game of sorts, built up either with some planning or on the fly, with unique factors available to the players to deal with the problems at hand. There is no specific solution, nor should there be (that would defeat the purpose of this kind of play).<br/><br/>Imagine Avalon Hill's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panzer_Leader_(game)" rel="nofollow">Panzer Leader</a>. It introduces many specific elements to engage players in a multi-faceted set of challenges based on lots of details of tank combat that, in fact, excludes pretty much everything else about life and war and the planet earth. There is no way to simulate all of reality at the table -- and that is not Panzer Leader's point. It is a unique experience of problem solving with the elements at hand designed to make a manageable, intriguing puzzle solving/challenging experience. <br/><br/>I consider my reference to the Appendixes of Dune in much the same train of thought -- but for use in the elasticity required for an RPG's "enveloping fiction." Frank Herbert lays out the details of religion, politics, history, economics, <i>et al</i> and says essentially, "These were the pieces on the board, the rules of world, that produced the situation that arose on Arrakis." He is defining the pieces that <i>matter</i> to the tale: religion, ecology, and so on. But he is also excluding a bucketload of material. How the fuck does Spice actually work? It doesn't! Not <i>really</i>. But it is one of the "situational factors" of the sort Eero refers to above. Again, is it real? No. Does it matter? Yes. Are there a bazillion other factors Herbert could have introduced in creating a fictional setting in the future involving a star spanning empire? Yes. Did he introduce a bazillion factors? No.<br/><br/>Bringing it all down to the focused level of a conflict/situation in an RPG per Eero's comments: <br/><br/>It sounds like Eero's group is doing exactly this kind of work. Picking the "reality" of whatever has been established and is at hand -- the biology of creatures, the powers of dark cultists, the kinds of weapons vs. the kinds of armor, how the duke is predisposed to one thing or another -- whatever is most interesting to focus on to build a series of moving pieces that will offer the Players an interesting set of <i>options</i> and <i>challenges</i> to manipulate and build on.<br/><br/>There can be no simulation or reality because -- well, <i>life</i> is reality and that's that. But there can be fascinating selection of fictional material which draws on both reality as it is known (a set of facts <i>useful</i> to building a challenge) and the fantasy as it is know for the same effect. This selection of material works at the macro level (setting building), to mid-level (situations and encounters, whether they be with creatures, magical metaphysics of potions, or whatever), to the micro-level to a specific set of "rules" for the use of a skill to determine success and effect (Eero's "rule of three" above).<br/><br/>Eero, yes?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425058/#Comment_425058" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-02T09:33:53+00:00" title="December  2, 2013  9:33AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a quite nice way of putting it, yes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425063/#Comment_425063" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-02T11:38:26+00:00" title="December  2, 2013 11:38AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very well said, Christopher.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425103/#Comment_425103" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-03T09:52:04+00:00" title="December  3, 2013  9:52AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2013 9:55AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, <br/><br/>I just want to thank everyone who participated in this thread. You made a bunch of things clear and I'm really grateful. <br/><br/>The thing is, there are ways of using techniques for any particular game well, and ways of using techniques for any particular game badly. Back in high school I did a lot of things really well as a GM. But there were a couple of times that I tried to use challenge techniques that ended up with frustration for a couple of players. In the same way, we had some really successful sessions with narrative based play. From that time, a <i>Bushido</i> game my little brother ran where we <i>chose</i> to stay and face the dragon about to attack the village even though we'd probably die was my first inkling of how stories work, let alone who story driven play should work.<br/><br/>But, with this thread I think I've got a solid handle on how to not only get Traveller to work right, but more help in challenge based play in general.
