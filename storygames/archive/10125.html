The dungeon in my OD&amp;D game (started, I think, around 1975-76) was called the Shattered Towers.  It was a valley that had once contained seven wizards towers belonging to a guild, and they had been on the losing end of a magical war.  The towers were half-melted stubs, and the valley was mostly vitrified rock.  But under each tower was a mostly-intact underground complex, and connecting the complexes were miles-long tunnels.  The place had its own ecosystem, rival adventurers, and guardians left by the wizards (mostly blue-glowing animated suits of plate armor).<br/><br/>(2) (4) My players basically cleaned it out a complex at a time, giving it a sort of natural pace.  Once it was cleared out, I created other places to adventure.<br/><br/>(3) They did find remains of a real scary magical weapons project, which they turned over the proper authorities for political points.<br/><br/>(5) I had a high-level map, but I didn't map the complexes in advance, but made them up on the fly as the players got to them.  I did, however, have sheets of prepared monsters and various notes about things they could run into.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224767/#Comment_224767" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-14T16:00:02+00:00" title="August 14, 2009  4:00PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My take on this:<br/><br/>1) It depends much on your own tastes (and how important is the fiction's coherence for the players). Me? I'm a "has to make sense" guy. Always have. Yet there is people who actually <b>prefer</b> it when they do not have to worry much about that.<br/><br/>2) In this regard, what had worked ok for me in the past is a sort of "light illusionist" pace. That is, I prepare scenes, fights, puzzles and stuff, but (this is the key) I do not match them to my map. So I throw them at my players at any time it sort of makes sense to me. They seem bored? Throw that fight at them. We might need some story? Give them some plot relevant stuff. And so on.<br/><br/>3) The simplest answer is "let them find that out by themselves". Cool architecture, items left by the defeated enemies, in-play maps, straight "let me tell you something" spoken by a NPC... My advise would be to not make this too streamlined. It's better to have exceeding clues and leads, and allow the players to pick their own paths. Else, go the Trail of Cthulhu way and feed the stuff directly to the players (and then their job is making sense of stuff, and not finding it).<br/><br/>4) I usually link this one to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>. I prefer to prepare "ecologies". Why is stuff there? How do they interact with each other? What are their movements? Who makes what and when? So I have the goblin scouts. Nice! What do they do? What's their duty? What (plot relevant) stuff would it make for them to carry? How would they feel about that Umber Hulk who lives at the caves? How loyal are they to the old warlock? And so on. That way you have a good start about what would happen should the players interfere (or not) with the already dynamic situation.<br/><br/>5) Once again, I relate this one to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>. If I know why is stuff there, I can tell how would the map look like. If you have needs (such as "hunting", "training", "experimenting" and stuff), you need locales to fulfill them. If you have history, you know what sort of "mods" there might be. For <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> I like doing relationship maps, but you can get over with it by just spending a few minutes thinking about this in your head. Sometimes stuff is pretty obvious. (And, yes. Go for the obvious.) Then, to make my <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> work, I prefer to assign monsters, traps, puzzles and NPCs not "locations", but zones. That is "this area is where you'll most likely find the warlock". And you do not need to have each and every room and encounter prepared before-hands. You just tailor it to your players' pace and tastes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224772/#Comment_224772" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-14T16:20:17+00:00" title="August 14, 2009  4:20PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Relevant to your interests:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Frank and K</cite><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>The Constructanomicon:</b></span><br/><br/>"How does that even stay up?"<br/><br/>Perhaps the most important question surrounding Dungeons and Dragons is the question why there are Dungeons and Dragons. When you think about it, that's pretty weird.<br/><br/><b>Dungeons: By the gods, why?</b><br/><br/>Alright, we know that you love dungeons. We love them too, despite the fact that we\u2019re pretty sure there is no good reason for the silly things. The average D&amp;D game world is frankly incapable of the technology or manpower needed to build vast underground complexes. I mean, look at our own world history: aside from a single underground city in Turkey and a couple of pyramids and tombs, the ancient world took a pass on underground life. Even the old excuse of \u201cWizards can magic it up and they do it because its defensible\u201d is a bit lame considering that we are talking about a world with teleport and burrowing and ethereal travel; being underground is actually a liability since its harder to escape and people can drop the roof onto you, not to mention the incredible costs involved in doing it even if magic is available.<br/><br/>So here is what we suggest: dungeons have an actual magical purpose. By putting anything behind at least 40\u2019 of solid, continuous material (like solid walls of dirt, stone, ice, or whatever, but not a forest of trees or rooms of furniture) the area is immune to unlimited-range or \u201clonger than Long Range\u201d spells like Scrying and transportation magic like teleport, greater teleport, the travel version of gate, and other effects. You can use these magics inside a dungeon, but you also stopped by a 40\u2019 solid, continuous material in a Line of Effect; this means you can use these effects inside a dungeon to bypass doors and walls, but entering and leaving the dungeon is a problem, and parts of the dungeon that have more than 30\u2019 of material in the way between your position and the target of your effect will be effectively isolated from your position.</blockquote>\nFind more at <a href="http://www.tgdmb.com/viewtopic.php?t=28547" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.tgdmb.com/viewtopic.php?t=28547</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224787/#Comment_224787" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-14T18:19:02+00:00" title="August 14, 2009  6:19PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1) Does a dungeon need a purpose other then just being there?<br/><br/>Effectively No, As long as you are willing to remove the creator from sympathetic consideration. If a bunch of Xenophobic dwarves made a retarded dungeon to stow their treasure in and filled it with the undead and elementals, there is 0 reason to have stuff like Loo's and lunch rooms (maybe it was a burial tomb and the people only expected to come back after they were dead to gather their things and take it to the next life, in real life ornate and useless tombs like this had a twofold purpose both spuring the economy and sinking massive amounts of gold so the constant dwarvish gold rushes/adventuring treasure didn't lead to retarded inflation. If it is just some dwarfs who happened to like living under ground, you better start plotting loo's<br/><br/>2) How do you maintain the pace in exploration vs. kicking down the door to steal stuff vs. quest to get X in the dungeon?<br/><br/>I would personally say that Quests to get X should be fueling exploration not some kind of 0 sum game. You adventure to get stuff that outlines the dungeon that shows more stuff to get so you adventure more. <br/><br/>3) If the dungeon has a mystery or mysteries associated with it how does that information get into the hands of the players?<br/><br/>Considering this stuff should just be colour 9/10, how do you normally get colour into your players hands/minds. Describe Describe Describe. Fuck kobolds and goblins, its mutant leatherworkers and cancerous servants of the mad god come to get maddness for the mad god (been reading too much mad gods stuff here)<br/><br/>Alternatively you can make the colour important (Which I think ultimately makes it not colour, some body who knows their terms help me out here). Have your puzzles, fights, and skill challenges (if applicible )reference the colour. Remember the lesson from Portal. People like to learn, the best way to learn is repitition and rewarding success. (honestly its pretty good game design  advice that everyone here should play threw with the commentary...)<br/><br/><br/>4) I don't like static dungeons. Tips, tricks, advice on maintaining a living dungeon and allowing the players to see the impact of their character's actions in the fiction?<br/><br/>I don't like boring dungeons. Rotating Patrols, Loo's and oxygen deprived rooms? Boring. I tend to roll with the mystic dungeon, also known as Underworld, Wounderland / Freud/Jungian Dungeon. (more like Undermountain, Pan's Labryinth, Thinnies from steven king less like moria/sewers/mines). In fact when someone says Epic or Mega Dungeon I down right expect this kind of dunegon. Worrying about static dungeons comes really seems like a meta critique most of the time. <br/>(which is too say, that 5 platinum dragons in a 10' by 10' room is okay once in a while, but if the party wins or loses, that encounter is done. You need something new like 8 Gold dragons or something. <br/><br/>As for 'impacting on the fiction" I think that 'impacting on the fiction' is the new illussionism, because honestly that's something you the gm makes happen, If your gonna make every choice in to the loving equivalent of a fork in the corridor, aint nothing gonna stop you. I would suggest if you want your players characters to have an influence on the fiction to do it before they get there (more like silent hill and less like idiot players ruining your finely crafted story ;D) At least that way you dont have to rely on your magic skills at determining 'meaningful choices and actions' as apposed to the stupid stuff your probably going to see. Your players are still impacting on the fiction (like say if you have a fire sorc, lets make a fire sork level, thats a pretty big impact actually) its just not story now per say. <br/> <br/>5) Maps - Does it need to be mapped out and room descriptions (do you really need 500 pages of room descriptions)?<br/><br/>Depends if your kicking it oldschool. If you want your players to map the whole way, you damn well better have one yourself (even if it is only a flowchart) and room descriptions are important because it keeps that dribble that you keep for when you can't think of anything inside your mouth instead of in my game.  A description per wing or something will probably keep the room description chore reasonable. <br/><br/>This is what I would do for the mega epic dungeon and its not for everyone so season to taste. i hope this was helpful. (and yes I know that none of the words I used meant what you think the words mean and I shouldn't use them that way because its confusing but you somehow still got here and know what I'm writting about so there (if not just go back to sleep)<br/><br/>L                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224814/#Comment_224814" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-15T01:48:07+00:00" title="August 15, 2009  1:48AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this depends on the players. I used to love Undermountain, it's falling apart, so it got a lot of reading and a lot of play. However, I tried revisiting it after a number of years and found it got boring after a while. The biggest problem was getting lost and not knowing the way out - it was almost designed with the BD&amp;D mentality of mapping things out as you go, but that got confounded by random teleports. You'll probably want to consider whether the dungeon is designed in a fairly linear fashion, or isn't terribly confusing, so you can work your way around without needing to draw a map, or if you're going to expect the players to be mapping as they go (and have this represented by one of the characters drawing a map). Perhaps also have some maps available for sale that have been drawn by previous adventurers that went in, with varying degrees of detail and accuracy. <br/><br/>I think having some sort of purpose to it would make things interesting. Is it a maze where people get trapped, with undead monsters wandering around? Is it an ancient burial tomb with lots of treasure, and traps to protect the treasure? You can do a lot of interesting stuff with that. Perhaps it's a pyramid for a burial tomb in the desert, sunken mostly so just the top is visible, it's sunk more on one side than another, so the whole thing is slanted with some sections submerged in water. Various monsters have taken up residence in it, and there is of course the undead monster that's unhappy to be disturbed. Then underneath there's an abandoned mine which dwarves were working on that ended up destabilising the pyramid above and having it collapse a number of caverns. The same could be done with a swamp or jungle, having the pyramid mostly overgrown, and have the undergrowth really thick and hard to get through, with lots of local threats, poisonous plants, etc so they're already weak by the time they get to the pyramid. Then they have to make their way through the pyramid, deal with the undead monster, and then finally work their way into the mine complex that has various monsters who have taken over it and a dragon who has settled in and got a hoard with all the gold the dwarves are working on. Then have some local people who watch over the pyramid who don't want it desecrated, and will attack the PCs as they come out - 'cause stuff like that always makes things interesting.<br/><br/>If you have something interesting like that, and have various clues of the history scattered around it'll be pretty interesting. I'd go with a number of encounters that could happen in a bunch of different places - having the entire place with encounters mapped out will be disappointing since they'll never explore every room unless they're incredibly meticulous. This will also let you control the pace, but if it's interesting they'll probably keep moving just by themselves. <br/><br/>A couple books I've read that would help with making it living are Dragon Mountain and Reverse Dungeon. Reverse Dungeon would probably be particularly good to look at since you'd see how the monsters would want to act in response to an incursion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/threegee" title="threegee"><img alt="threegee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/threegee">threegee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224816/#Comment_224816" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-15T02:25:07+00:00" title="August 15, 2009  2:25AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The most important thing to remember about dungeons is that they are the very last bastions for those of us who love exploration. A good dungeon is so big that no adventuring party could hope to map every room and corridor. Unfortunately, it is hard to deliberately sit down and design in one go anything this size. General themes and a stock of traps and puzzles can be stretched out to fill in details as required. Think of a dungeon as a city: what kind of lunatic would go door to door, block by block, examining each minute detail and mapping it all out? An excursion has a purpose, which leads to contact with certain types of people/creatures. A different excursion into the same city/dungeon could very well result in a completely different experience. Still, there is a sense of wonder at the great diversity of it all. Linear dungeons that don't need to be mapped at all, and only feature one or two creature types, leave me cold. Give me ridiculous puzzles, obscure riddles, and perverse obstacles, and I will be happy.<br/><br/>I always liked the dungeons in the original Forgotten Realms boxed set. Undermountain was also great. The earlier stuff was a bit too random, but honestly, I didn't notice at the time. If you really want a lovefest for dungeons, though, you need to look at early CRPGs like Wizardry and Might &amp; Magic. NetHack is also great for its sheer diversity of experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/QHudspeth" title="QHudspeth"><img alt="QHudspeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://quentinhudspeth.com/journal/wp-content/themes/atahualpa/images/H%20Logo%20super%20extra%20small.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/QHudspeth">QHudspeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224859/#Comment_224859" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-15T12:08:57+00:00" title="August 15, 2009 12:08PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So my answer to all of the questions, in general, is you've got to play to your audience, but also keep it interesting for yourself. This might seem like just a restatement of your questions (and it well may be), but let me try to be more clear.\n<blockquote>1) Does a dungeon need a purpose other then just being there?<br/>5) Maps - Does it need to be mapped out and room descriptions (do you really need 500 pages of room descriptions)?</blockquote>\nThe answer to 1) really depends on what the mood of your game is. If your group is looking for a munckined slug-fest, then no. You don't <em>really</em> need anything more than a few rooms per session stocked with some random CR appropriate monsters. But not too many gamers can handle that mindless churn for more than a session or three. So, I'd say the dungeon needs a purpose, even if it is as simple as "this is a series of underground caverns that local monsters have taken to calling home". If nothing else, having a backstory for the dungeon will give you fodder for your descriptions, your rationale for choosing certain monsters to stock it, and a scrap of reason for having the players in there in the first place. As for 5), that depends on how good you are at extemporizing. If you aren't going to map the dungeon out in detail before, then you will need some notes on the kinds of terrain and monsters that are common, roughly how it is laid out, roughly how much area it covers. You should familiarize yourself with the lifestyles of the monsters that inhabit the dungeon, so you have an idea what treasure they may have, where it would be stored, and what mundane trappings they would have in their abodes.\n<blockquote>3) If the dungeon has a mystery or mysteries associated with it how does that information get into the hands of the players?</blockquote>\nI like the idea of having multiple sources for information, so you can cover your ass. Rumors in the local town, scribblings in the library, visions of doom, and mysterious strangers are some ways to disseminate information before the players enter the dungeon. You don't have to have pre-generated pamphlets for each of those eventualities, but have an idea of what information you want available as hearsay or through research outside the dungeon, and let the players surprise you with what resources you use. Inside the dungeon, NPCs rescued or captured and interrogated, journal entries and ancient prophesies carved in stone, and plain old eavesdropping are good ways to convey a sense of the dungeon's story whilst inside. Again, you may want to extemporize on the precise sources, but have a general sense of what information you want to give out.<br/><br/>I'm afraid I don't know about 2 &amp; 4, which are probably the important ones here. Perhaps if there is a race-the-clock aspect that they can discover through play, that would give them incentive to keep moving. One nice thing about not having the place mapped out precisely is they don't inadvertantly skip the room with the important plot hook or useful item. Just put it in front of them until they notice it. If you use a race-the-clock theme and they <em>don't</em> get it, there should be consequences. NPCs are found dead rather than alive. Certain rooms are flooded. The Big Bad isn't home or surprises them in an unexpected room. It doesn't have to be anything pregenerated.
