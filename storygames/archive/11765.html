As a definite non-expert in both Potterism and 4th edition it seems to me that you'd get pretty far by simply limiting player characters to the arcane power source. The common wisdom seems to be that as long as you have something to cover all four team roles, it should work fine even with drastically cut character options. Wouldn't even need that much reskinning, most of that fluff seems entirely feasible as something I'd expect in a Potter-style wizard world. I might also allow some martial classes for non-spellcasting badasses, unless I misremember the Potter tone. Perhaps accept one such deviation as a mascot, requiring the rest of the characters to be wizards.<br/><br/>The much more difficult question, of course, would be the issue of forcing the Potter world into conforming with the violent team-based skirmish action that's so fundamental to 4th edition D&amp;D. Perhaps one could reimagine the central conflict between the good and evil wizards on a grander scale? Postulate something... I don't know, an evil dimension that the bad wizards are using as a staging area and HQ for their deprevations, some place where the PCs can travel to adventure and slaughter magical monsters, slowly mapping the place and penetrating deeper, finally finding and conquering the evil HQ and putting an end to the conflict. In fact, import Shadowfell and call it a day, I say. If you want, decide that the portal to Shadowfell is situated below the wizard school and only students and some trusted adults know about it to explain why teenagers are saving the world here.<br/><br/>The way I'd do it would be to break the ridiculous magician masquerade and have some evil wizards nuke Moscow to start the campaign. That sort of apocalyptical vision would nicely segue into a desperate fight for survival over real stakes <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> Would have to decide how to deal with mundane weaponry and such, of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262828/#Comment_262828" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T14:09:39+00:00" title="March 18, 2010  2:09PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the way you characterize Dnd 4th edition as only combat and harry potter having none. <br/><br/>I seem to recall quite a few dashing adventurous fights, combats, nastines and tactical combat assualts in the harry potter and quite a few touching moments, learning of things, important patrons to the main characters and character development in 4th edition. <br/><br/>I mean really AURORS MAN AURORS                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262832/#Comment_262832" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T14:19:28+00:00" title="March 18, 2010  2:19PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the magic model is pretty spot on, but I don't think Harry Potter (or anyone in that fictional setting) has hit points.

It was more like children's adventure novels, with protagonists hiding and avoiding scary enemies until a deus ex machina or some such could save the day. The later books could involve more D&amp;D-style action, of course.<br/><br/>As Jared notes, though, 4th edition D&amp;D is pretty combat-focused. Seems like a lot of unnecessary details work if you're not going to apply the skirmish combat system in a central role in actual play. Old basic D&amp;D I could see easier, it being less focused on combat options. With 4th edition you're going to have this massive character sheet entirely devoted to combat options in front of you, so it sort of seems misleading if the actual gameplay is going to be mostly non-combatty, you know.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm no expert on either side of the equation, just musing on the options.

For one thing, they involve a lot of bookkeeping, especially if you possess them in the quantities seen in higher level D&amp;D characters. I also don't like the way they make a game feel... well, computer-gamey. Purely a subjective response I know, but still a factor. And OK there aren't many systems that don't have some level of bookkeeping to their health mechanics, but there are a few.

A potentially fruitful way of thinking could be to consider that limitation a retroactive metagame feature: in fact this spell here can only be effectively used in combat in very specific circumstances, it just so happens that we allow the player of the character to decide when the combateers and environment are in a position to use the spell - and the fact that this condition, whatever it may be, is never fulfilled another time through the day is just a coincidence. Heck, the simplest fictional explanation is that Voldemort surely casts Death Curse all the time, it's just that every other time the opposing countermagic/dodging/whatever succeeds automatically <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Hit points can be thought around in similar ways (just think of them as drama points that tell you when you can describe a cool move that actually lands), although I do agree that it's not immediately obvious that Harry Potter combats are self-enclosed arcs of attrition like D&amp;D shows us; a more natural way of looking at that sort of drama seems to be to think of the entire combat as one, unified conflict resolution procedure where tactical choices are not that important. But if you want a tactical game flavoured with HP sauce and don't mind minor inconsistencies, the difficulties don't seem that insurmountable to me. Just one character class seems like a recipe for trouble, though, considering how the 4th edition rules are constructed; probably better to use the entire arcane set of mages, swordmages, bards and whatever else they've published - nothing says that you can't call them all "wizards" even if the characters are mechanically of different classes, after all. Maybe call the arcane defender (can't remember if there is one) a "defence against dark arts wizard", eh?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262845/#Comment_262845" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T14:51:05+00:00" title="March 18, 2010  2:51PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2010 2:53PM by sage.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ashok - I think you're right, if we were trying to model the way the characters see the world, spells would have to be castable at any time.

These are somewhat D&amp;D-like, but I'm not sure how important positioning is, and things like area control don't come up too much. Usually, when the narration focuses on the combat it tends to talk about individuals "dueling" with each other, and I don't recall many examples of effective teamwork, though, so 4E might not be the perfect model.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Destriarch</cite>Sorry, I'm not seeing it.

That magic thing, for instance - it might be the case that Jonathan is wrong and HP spells actually matter a great deal from the viewpoint of the author, but that's not what I got out of the novels; rather, it seems pretty obvious that you first choose what the character wants to accomplish, then decide whether he should succeed, then choose a nice visual, and <i>only then</i> name the spell actually used to accomplish whatever it was. I'd be pretty surprised if the author worked from a pre-detailed magical system, frankly.<br/><br/>Of course it's entirely feasible to complain that even if the author doesn't use a magical system, a given roleplayer might want one because he wants to immerse in the HP setting and the experience of being a HP wizard. That's a pretty typical approach in mainstream licence games, after all. Jonathan is, however, also entirely correct in pointing out that if you want to create HP-like fiction, then the most straightforward way is definitely to follow the procedures an author uses, not those used by the characters in the fiction.<br/><br/>That's all a bit secondary in that Logos was looking for advice specifically with D&amp;D, I understand. It's easy to recommend Primetime Adventures or FATE or Solar System for something like this (all systems that would be trivial to fit for HP), but where's the challenge in that?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262863/#Comment_262863" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T15:23:08+00:00" title="March 18, 2010  3:23PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have dirty shameful boners for HP and 4E, so I clicked on this thread even knowing full well that it would immediately slew into "no man what you really want is a Pool hack."<br/><br/>Here's how I'd do Harry Potter with D&amp;D:<br/><br/>Combine Str and Con into Guts.<br/>Combine Dex and Cha into Talent.<br/>Combine Wis and Int into Cleverness.<br/><br/>The corresponding defenses are Withstand, Dodge and Outfox.<br/><br/>Keep HP.

A lot of them make repeat appearances, while a few naturally show just once, but the repeat appearances suggest to me that in the actual world there are specific spells. There's also the fact that Snape and Ginny are specifically highlighted as having the capacity to invent spells on the spot - given it's a rather unique ability I'd suggest you're not having free-form casting as a base system for everyone.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brendan</cite>I have dirty shameful boners for HP and 4E, so I clicked on this thread even knowing full well that it would immediately slew into "no man what you really want is a Pool hack."<br/><br/>Here's how I'd do Harry Potter with D&amp;D:<br/><br/>Combine Str and Con into Guts.<br/>Combine Dex and Cha into Talent.<br/>Combine Wis and Int into Cleverness.<br/><br/>The corresponding defenses are Withstand, Dodge and Outfox.<br/><br/>Keep HP.

Roles are a quick and dirty short hand for making sure there are varied abilities in the party and thats about it, and pc creation purposes. You can get that variety in a party of all wizards, presuming you have enough spell selection (and spell variety) to choose from. even if you wanted to get rid of the Enounter/Daily bits (ie making them all at-will), it wouldn't be that horrible, especially if you kept in the heoric tier.

It was pretty much encounter ending. I also don't recall Bellatrix going and firing off a few more Avadakedavras after icing Sirius.<br/>Ah yes, Patronus is the one example of a one-cast spell, and there's no reason why it couldn't be cast again but there's no point if your patronus is already about and as you rightly say, it's a scene-ender. Furthermore its usefulness is limited because it only really seems to be useful against Dementors. Incidentally, I believe Bellatrix didn't fire off another Avada Kedavra because she was having a good gloat <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> I think it more likely that certain spells aren't used regularly because they require more focus and intent. For example we know from the canon that for Avada Kadavra to work you really need to want to kill someone. Even in the most twisted individuals that kind of willpower must be hard to muster. Simpler to use Stupefy, then have a gloat, then kill them when you can concentrate.<br/><br/>I get what people are saying about the spells-per-X limit being a meta-rule; they attempt to cast it as often as they like, but it only works so many times and the rest is just set-dressing. The simple fact of the matter is though, *they still try and cast the spell*. If they know it's not going to work again for a set amount of time, why would they bother to attempt to cast it again? And then you're into the problem of persuading the players to do something they know won't work just because it's in-theme.<br/><br/>More simply, it just doesn't evoke the feeling of Potter to me. Sadly there is never likely to ever be a Harry Potter RPG, because it really deserves its own custom-made system.

Similarly, with the intent to kill someone, if you really have to focus, once you've killed you've got your release, and if you'll pardon the analogy, it would be like trying to ejaculate twice in a row. Given that nature of it, you'd figure most people wouldn't be able to do it multiple times. Perhaps special NPCs (like Voldemort) could throw off multiple ones, but he was the baddest of the bad, it rather makes sense he'd be able to do that. A thing to remember is a lot of the spells are pretty much scene enders. Expelliarmus ends a battle - no wand, pretty hard time casting spells. That's sort of a thing where a wizard battle really comes down to who has the higher initiative, and if you're outnumbered you're screwed.

Hit points represent more than physical endurance. They represent your character's skill, luck, and resolve -- all the factors that combine to help you stay alive in a combat situation."<br/><br/>Some people think it's goofy that hp are defined in this abstract way, but losing hit points does <i>not</i> always represent physical injury in D&amp;D 4E. Therefore, there's no reason that Avada Kedavra couldn't be a big-damage spell instead of an insta-kill even though it's called the killing curse in the fiction. If you've run out of luck (i.e. hit points) and someone hits you with it, you die. If someone throws it at you but you're still high in hp, you narrowly dodge it. For similar reasons, there's no requirement that the "non-violent" spells that the good guys use to take people out should be "non-damaging".\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brendan</cite>All their hexes are basically ways of inflicting conditions: ... stupefy</blockquote>\nI think Stupefy is clearly an HP-dealing spell. It takes out wimpy bad guys, important bad guys get knocked down but not taken out by it, Hagrid is able to shrug off multiple hits...<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>Expelliarmus ends a battle - no wand, pretty hard time casting spells.

As I recall, most of the adult wizards in the Order of the Phoenix think that Harry is foolish for overusing Expelliarmus.<br/><br/>If you really want to model Harry Potter in 4E, it would probably be worthwhile to break down the combat scenes in the 5th, 6th, and 7th books and see who uses which spells to what effect. It would probably be more instructive than trying to emulate the "magical physics" of the wizarding world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263018/#Comment_263018" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-19T14:47:23+00:00" title="March 19, 2010  2:47PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dan Maruschak</cite>Some people think it's goofy that hp are defined in this abstract way, but losing hit points does<i>not</i>always represent physical injury in D&amp;D 4E.

If it was personal they wouldn't need wands (and the 'personal' power that harry exhibits in the book is not magic its love or something like it) Maybe I just have a really dry and plebian reading of harry potter.<br/><br/>Just saying that all these things people bring to table trying to model harry potter doesn't seem any worst than hps to me, and hps have the benefit of being prooven and true (and 3d8+2 psychic damage has the benefit of being popular ) to make them stand out of the pack. <br/><br/>As for actually modelling stuff, Your gonna need someone to go threw the actually cast harry potter spells and see about modeling them. (in whatever system you use) and you also need to decide if your going to play fair and square (ie give everyone equal importance) or not (which is pretty established in the book , but not the book's universe if you know what i mean) and a bunch of other decisions and all that. Either way, I dont see a way to do it, using the already available material in 4th edition (too many signature moves dont translate to what we have atm both ways) so yeah I think your in hack territory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263348/#Comment_263348" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-22T07:49:11+00:00" title="March 22, 2010  7:49AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would argue the final battle between the students of Hogwarts and the Death Eaters was very 4E and tactical.

They're about "this personal issue suddenly got bigger than me, and I need to master this spell along with my fears".<br/>It's a lens to view those situations by... perhaps not the right one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263374/#Comment_263374" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-22T09:54:47+00:00" title="March 22, 2010  9:54AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>Hermoine learning to multiply time when her academic ambition and anxiety grew</blockquote>\nYou've got that backwards. In the third book, Hermione is given a time turner in order to take more classes but she deals poorly with the stress of the added workload.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>Neville learning how to cast something or other while "Harry's private army" practiced in secret.</blockquote>\nI don't recall this being a problem with a particular spell, but Neville having problems doing anything under pressure.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>I'm sure I could name others.</blockquote>\nCould you? I'm still not seeing this pattern. Harry and his friends do indeed grow up and master fears, etc., through the books, but I don't see this process reflected as trouble learning spells. Expecto Patronum is the special case, not the common case, and the characters explain that the emotional aspect of that spell make it unusual.                        </div>\n<div

The Broomstix game has some good starting points and is worth reading just for them. Skills being linked to the classes is a prime example. I think a Burning Wheel style lifepath system where players choose their strengths through birth, house and role might be a good starting point. Hps is a solid example to follow but they probably need to be renamed and re-examined to better represent loosing oomph in a fight rather than loosing blood or life force or whatever. 4e really might work though spell casting would need to be tweeked. Using skill challenges to complete school work sounds like it would fit perfectly in the HP universe. Perhaps players would learn spells at a once per day level though class work and the expend XP to raise them to once per encounter level and at-will level or do so through out of class skill challenges or perhaps both.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263510/#Comment_263510" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-22T16:00:31+00:00" title="March 22, 2010  4:00PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm thinking with a school setting that it would likely be in, a relationship and clique system.

In the second book getting it is a significant subplot. In the seventh book they're chugging the stuff left and right.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>I don't see spell use as being tied to academic rigor, except in the case of Hermoine*.<br/>I see spell use as reflective of personal trials, tribulations, strengths and goals.<br/>Spell use as proof of character.<br/><br/>And that's perhaps a strained reading of the Harry Potter franchise.<br/>I'm cool with that, as I like the ideas I'm playing with.<br/></blockquote>\nI agree that JK Rowling frequently uses magic as a way of showcasing the themes she's trying to hit and demonstrate character growth. It's a significant chracter moment in book one when Hermione hits Neville with the Petrificus Totalus, but if your formula applied we would have needed to see her struggling with learning that spell through the whole book. Similarly, it's an interesting character moment when Harry uses Expelliarmus on Voldemort in book four, but he's been proficient with that spell since the dueling club scene in book two. I would probably agree with your perspective if you weren't tying it so directly to "learning spells" but broadened it out a bit to "using magic" (which could come from spells they're learning, spells they know, or the various enchanted objects, etc., that feature prominently).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tristan</cite>For "leveling spells" I have been thinking about The Shadow of Yesterday.
