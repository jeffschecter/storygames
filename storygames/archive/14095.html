Crudely stated, this means that in fantasy the characters meet themselves - or parts of themselves, their own needs/problems/exigencies - as actors on the stage of the story, and so the internal struggle to deal with those needs/problems/exigencies is played out as an external struggle in the action of the story."</i> --Stephen R. Donaldson<br/><br/>Imagine if when creating a character in a game, you not only created their emotional attributes (as TRoS calls them, or BITs in Burning Wheel, or Intimacies in Exalted), but created something in the physical world that embodied that particular conflict for your character. It could happen in a few different ways; your character's need to reconcile with an old friend could become a band of brigands that kidnap him, or a cave system that is your only way back to him, or a vampire that's hunting him.<br/><br/>The key would be to have something that you can feed the GM to say, "Here, bring my traits into the story with this thing," and you as player would get the cue that you're dealing with that plotline and maybe even be able to emotionally tie some sort of resolution from the external thing to the character's internal self.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG" title="Albi_SG"><img alt="Albi_SG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG">Albi_SG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319026/#Comment_319026" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-06T06:48:30+00:00" title="April  6, 2011  6:48AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...well, that's actually what some were proposing for the (ideal) Scott Pilgrim RPG.

So your own problems have a direct echo in the form of paranormal stuff happening to you.<br/><br/>You have some issues with your father? Great! Your Guardian and his are at odds (maybe yours is a Fire Cat and his is a Water Dog).<br/>You just can't manage to be on time to your appointments? Well, there is a mischievous spirit inhabiting the bus stop by your house.<br/>Your computer crashes constantly and you loose your temper at that with ease? Your PC happens to have a whimsy and temperamental spirit attached to it.<br/><br/>The point is to blur the border between "internal" and "external" by surrealism and esoteric stuff.<br/><br/>In fact, my goal is to have the external conflicts be a direct consequence to the internal and personal conflicts of the characters.

Or he can be trapped under a ton of rubble, think of Aunt May and add that to his attempt to escape.<br/><br/>We had a character with Code of Honor as a Quality. It was both a burden and an assett.

Freud. <br/><br/>I think this Jungian/sub-conscious-mind approach to fantasy is really important in that it puts fantasy in the same category as a lot of children's literature - the world surrounding the protagonist is an expression of his/her perception of that world, rather than genuinely being a representation of an actual place. <br/><br/>This tension between really-real and metaphor-only fantasy writing has shown up, imo, most clearly in the work of Terry Pratchett - he's gotten a lot of mileage out of lampooning and straight-up slamming a lot of fantasy tropes, but part of his approach seems to be a desire to develop the reader's critical thinking skills (as well as make good jokes); if I'm supposed to be incredulous and skeptical while reading a fantasy novel, I may be reading the wrong genre, at least to some extent.<br/><br/>It's interesting to look at somewhat more Jungian-style fantasy (LotR, imo) and consider how Tolkien brings the "real world" into the text, perhaps without meaning to. I don't have a link to the exact article I'm thinking of (in which a South Asian American man relates what it was like be a child and see dark-skinned evil barbarians in LotR books) but the following excerpt from <a href="http://www.suite101.com/content/racism-and-the-lord-of-the-rings-a30282" rel="nofollow">this site I found</a>.<blockquote><b>No Racist Agenda</b><br/><br/>It would be completely unreasonable to suggest that J.R.R. Tolkien wrote these books with a racist agenda, or that Peter Jackson filmed them with any prejudiced intent. However, works of art do not exist in cultural vacuums, and part of the films could be seen as subconsciously bolstering a discourse in which Western civilization is under threat from subhuman hordes from the East. It\u2019s an astonishing example of how general cultural discourse can overtake and even co-opt works of art as apparently distanced from political reality as a fantasy novel and an epic movie.</blockquote>\nI think it's important not to make mountains out of molehills, but at the very least, when the symbolic-unconscious monsters in a text resemble real people in a too-uncomfortable way, we start to get into territory where the audience is at least going to <i>think</i> the author was "really saying" something about real people. I guess the trick, a trick used countless times by any number of allegorical writers, is to remind the audience of the real world only from a very long angle, as trying too hard to inject one's particular ideas into a) a novel and b) a fantasy novel at that, can cause the "message" to come across as ham-handed (Ferngully) or nonsensical (Avatar). <br/>I think it's important for authors to be at least conscious of their intentions - are they trying to express an opinion, or merely relate an enjoyable narrative? From there, I think that's the stage at which the author can contemplate how to go about carrying out their intentions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319926/#Comment_319926" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-10T15:28:29+00:00" title="April 10, 2011  3:28PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought this might have been a thread about how to generate a SuckerPunch RPG...it's certainly giving me ideas for how one could be constructed for various settings and internal dilemmas while staying true to the thematic oeuvre of the movie.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319927/#Comment_319927" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-10T15:46:02+00:00" title="April 10, 2011  3:46PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: George Cotronis</cite>Aren't those basically flags?<br/><br/>Aspects could work like that pretty easily, I think.
