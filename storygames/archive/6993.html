Perhaps there has been so many years of interbreeding that extremely pale skin like those of Northern European or Irish descent might have, or the very dark skin often found in people from south of the Sahara has pretty much been lost to a more medium skin tone.  The same would go for bone structure, facial features, etc.,.<br/><br/>Another example might be that an event occurred witch destroyed huge segments of the population.  Say for example, in 2030, the Earth is destroyed by a cosmic event (alien attack, something wierd with the sun, whatever) and for whatever reason, the only people to escape were from a single locale.  In the future to follow such an event, people would be all likely be pretty homogeneous in appearance, would they not?<br/><br/>Could natural selection, mating choices, etc., once again produce a diversity of skin colours, facial features etc., out of either such population?  Or would it be pretty much set at that point?  What about from the result of the first example, massive, long term interbreeding?<br/><br/>What are the implications for an author or game designer making such choices?  Is any skin tone, features, etc., fair game?  Are any not?<br/><br/>Say the author spins the globe and sticks his finger down and after a few goes, gets Accra (Ghana), Jakarta (Indonesia), Saint Petersburg (Russia), Mexico City (Mexico), Reykjav\xedk (Iceland), Shanghai (China), Tel Aviv (Israel) and New Dehli (India) as possible launch points for the one rocket that escapes Earth's destruction.  The author/designer also assumes that the catastrophe caught the Earth mostly unaware and the population on the escape craft pretty much represents the local population of those cities today (give or take a small amount) and no other people escaped.<br/><br/>Are any of the choices specifically more or less legitimate than others?  If so, why?  Which would you choose?  Why?  Which would you specifically avoid?  Why?<br/><br/>Hopefully wish fulfillment is not a motive for anyone in picking.  It would be quite gross if someone misconstrued my question as being about a fantasy trip about choosing which people get to survive and which die.  Someone making the choice on that level would quite frankly, sicken me.  What I'm trying to get at is the issues behind representing race in fiction and what is okay and what is not in our modern climate.<br/><br/>Along those lines, would your decision change based on where the work containing this concept was published?  Or would it change based on the nationality of the author?  Does changing these factors influence what choices are acceptable or not acceptable?<br/><br/>My answer:<br/>I grew up in the middle of nowhere in rural Canada.  The only people groups I knew growing up where a couple diferent First Nations tribes, some of mixed European descent, a handful of Jewish families, a lot of people from the Ukraine, some Hutterites.  I moved to a nearby city to go to college, but that city pretty much had the same groups as where I grew up with the exception of a large Filipino population.  Since then, I've spent most of my time either in Eastern Europe, coastal Asia and on the West Coast of Canada.  <br/><br/>So I'd likely pick either St. Petersburg or Jakarta, just because I have less difficulty imagining people from those places.  I have never lived anywhere with a large population of those of African or Indian descent and quite frankly, if a person said to me "then a guy came around the corner", I would be the least likely to initially picture that person being dark skinned.  So I guess I might pick Ghana or New Dehli just as an exercise in improving my imagination to make up for my lack of experience.  Tel Aviv would also be a good pick for me as I love the history of the Near East and see massive potential for exploring the religious ideas related to covenants in a sci-fi setting.<br/><br/>As for how it would be received, which are inappropriate, etc., I'd probably intentionally avoid those issues in my decision making process and be willing to weather the storm of any negative reaction one way or another, even if it severely limited the commercial viability of the product by either not appealing to a particular target demographic nor appeasing people's sense of what is politically correct (after all, who knows if I'd even be making a for sale product).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155576/#Comment_155576" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-09T04:27:48+00:00" title="July  9, 2008  4:27AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think, for me, the answer would depend mostly on these factors:<br/>- Who am I writing for?

Creationism? <br/><br/>If I were writing just for myself, and not looking to address any specific issues, I'd pick a group/nationality I knew little about and wanted to explore.

You see, in that sort of time--particular with expansionism and, thus, environmental pressures from both space and near-Terran planets--you'd have some significant diversification. It wouldn't even take evolution: transhumans could do just about anything to the base-human form to accommodate a different wavelength of sunlight, higher or lower gravity, pressure and radiation resistance, etc. Sure, for a few hundred years (max), you'd have whatever baseline folk got off-planet. But WAY downstream... no way. I can see Jovian "humans" that are vast, mostly-gaseous forms; deep-space humans immune to vacuum and micrometeroite impacts (chitinous skin?); stumpy, barrel-chested humans with blue skin living on a very high-gravity planet close to a blue dwarf sun... I think you get the idea.<br/><br/>Now, in terms of approaching theme via race... well, you got a WHOLE lot of latitude and potential directions, as seen in other fictional forms and media. Though that could be fruitful to investigate, that approach is of no real interest to me; and so I'll wait to see what your game play goals are before rambling further.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155607/#Comment_155607" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-09T07:48:14+00:00" title="July  9, 2008  7:48AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran into a similar issue with <i>Legends of Alyria</i>, which posits a similar disaster in the backstory of the setting.

Details are <a href="http://firmamentproject.wordpress.com/2008/04/24/character-creation-notes/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  Making it geographic, tied to where people are from, gets away from focusing specifically on ethnicity and skin color in a way I like.  You don't have to be, like, I'm from X ethnic group living in Indonesia.  Instead, after about 15 minutes scouring the internet for details, you can be like: <br/><br/><i>I'm from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidore" rel="nofollow">the island of Tidore</a>, from a family of nutmeg farmers, and grew up playing in the old colonial forts.  The closest major settlement to our farm, Ome Village, where a lot of foreign scuba divers come, was badly damaged in the tsunami, as was our entire crop that year, but we received some aid money and are just getting by. The roof of our local mosque also caved in, from the wind and rain, but members of various families pitched in to help rebuild it and it should be reopening soon.</i><br/><br/>Boom.

Whatever people first left Africa were probably just a tiny sample of the existing genetic diversity, so it might have been pretty close to the single-spaceship-of-survivors scenario.  So we know that all the diversity of human appearance in the present-day world was generated in 60,000 years by gene-shuffling, mutation, adaptation, etc.  In other words, it happened before, it could happen again.<br/><br/>But yeah, as others have said, it's all about what you want to do.  Realism is a chimera.  You pick what you want to write and then make up a plausible-sounding chain of events to lead to that situation.  If an author or game desginer postulated a mono-racial future humanity, I would think they were trying to Say Something.  (And not a scientific point about rates of genetic drift, either.)

I've read a lot of American mid-century SF in which, apparently, the future was peopled only by white, protestant Americans (and mostly males).  And I don't think there's any excuse to perpetuate that.  So I would probably judge an all-white or all-american future by an American author more harshly than I would judge, say, an all-Indian future by an author from India.  They're logically equivalent but the latter is something I haven't already seen a million times, so I'd roll my eyes but I'd keep reading.<br/><br/>Also, there's a big difference between reading "My Own People Are The Sole Inheritors of Humanity" vs. "Oops, My Own People All Died Out, These Other Guys Are The Sole Inheritors of Humanity".  The former sounds like all kinds of bigotry and nationalism, the latter is like: hmmm, interesting, I wonder what the author's really trying to say here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
