                    Interesting blog post here:  <a href="http://jayloomis.livejournal.com/2562.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://jayloomis.livejournal.com/2562.html</a><br/><br/>The point is that boardgames are being revitalised but facing less hostility in the process than rpgs get, plus that boardgames are easy to pick up and play in a way rpgs still generally aren't.<br/><br/>Similar stuff can be said for skirmish wargames, not the revitalising bit (though it's a healthy hobby) but that people can pick up the rules and get playing quickly and that quite complex and highly simulationist game experiences can be generated using generally very light (by rpg standards) rulesets.<br/><br/>Which suggests that we (in the wider sense) may be missing a trick.  Particularly sim gamers like me, who historically have gone for levels of crunch that equally if not more simmy people in the skirmish wargames hobby have felt no real need for.                </div>

                            Good link, thanks. <br/><br/>I agree with the point being made there that the historical complexity of RPG rules is something which should be re-examined. I think this may be something to do with the fact that it's hard to charge money for two pages of rules which aren't accompanied by a board, some cards and a couple of dice, all inside a box. If all you're selling is the rules, you feel the pressure to write at least 64 pages if not more.                        </div>

                            Yeah, I just posted a wad there which amounts to all the discussion we've been doing on the subject right here for the past half a year:
<blockquote>Interesting stuff, Jay! Crazy enough, there's been a lot of talk of basically applying board-game development and elements over at Story Games (so much so, in fact, I've been thinking about making a new topic for it).<br/><br/>Here's the topic that started it all:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=31" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=31</a> &lt;-- A fully playable RPG in two hours<br/>And from there,<br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=813" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=813</a> &lt;--<br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=862" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=862</a> &lt;-- Elements of an boardgame-RPG gateway game<br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=874" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=874</a> &lt;-- More thought on the same thing<br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=873" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=873</a> &lt;-- People's ideas about combining board-game elements with RPGs.<br/>(IIRC, some of the above discussions will only be able to be seen if you're logged in, but you can see some)<br/><br/>Now, in the above some come out and try to make hybrids of RPGs and boardgames, which is a little off from what yu're talking about. But the first discussion, and the gateway game discussions, are about putting some serious thought into making the RPG readily accessible and playable.<br/><br/>Mind you, all this thought is at the fringe corners of the hobby. The mainstream would rather of course buy a license, slap in some generic game rules, make it slightly easier than Rolemaster and wildly proclaim "It will bring new people into the hobby!"&lt;/p&gt;</blockquote>
There's a lot of cool thought on the matter here, and a lot of people with ideas simmering.  In fact, that first thread was the one that got me into thinking about Time as this year's game chef ingredient, and getting people to experiment with ways to get RPGs to be easier to pick up and play.                        </div>

                            Perhaps one way of getting round the 64-pages-of-rules thing would be to use, say, <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/" rel="nofollow">CafePress</a> posters instead of books. It takes a bit of clicking round to get their dimensions but they are: <br/><br/>Mini poster: 11" x 17"<br/>Small poster: 16" x 20"<br/>Large poster: 23" x 35"<br/><br/><a href="http://www.zazzle.com/link.asp?associate_id=238875486410802510&amp;redirect=home" rel="nofollow">Zazzle</a> have a wider range: 11" x 16.5" up to 52" x 78" (all in either orientation), and it looks like you can do custom sizes, too. DISCLOSURE: That link contains my associate ID. (Might as well, eh?)<br/><br/>Something like those <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=944&amp;page=1#Item_15" rel="nofollow">two-pagers that we were discussing</a> might work like this, for example.<br/><br/>The main drawback is that they're expensive (because they're designed for art prints). If you had really rocking good colour artwork in a great layout, of course, people might not mind that.<br/><br/>A quick Google on "print cheap poster" and "print cheap poster one-color" suggests you could get them cheaper if you shopped around, though you'd probably have to do your own order fulfillment in most cases.                        </div>

                            Wow, a game on a poster. Why do I feel this ideas rocks on toast? *shrugs*<br/>
<br/>
I could so picture Karbon as a game on poster!<br/>
<br/>
Just shopping around, I could easily do a 11x17 print poster (gloss coat, everything) and make a bit of money at $5 a pop. A larger 12.75 x 17.25 would require a substainal initial investment and 250 copies, but I would make a killing at $4 a pop. Interesting things come to mind.                        </div>

                            I've considered using 11x17 for a four-page game, with a single fold and the interior layout covering the entire two pages.  It'd be dirt cheap and look sorta cool.                        </div>

                            I'm a hybrid Boardgame-RPG designer, and have spent a lot of time thinking about the relative strengths of both boardgames and RPGs.<br>
<br>
I read a great comment someplace that said D&amp;D (the generic RPG) is 20 minutes of fun wrapped in 4 hours of game.<br>
<br>
I think a lot of (older) RPGs invest effort in making the game more detailed, realistic, or modular -- often at the expense of making it fun.  RPGs can learn from boardgames to think about what the players are actually doing at the table.  Are they spending a lot of time doing math?  Looking up rules in books?  Waiting while someone else does math or looks up rules?  Listening to other people roleplaying (sometimes badly)?  How often do they get to take their "turn" and how often do they have to watch other people taking their turns?  How often do they get to make interesting decisions, roll dice, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I found listening to these podcasts of a group in the UK playing D&amp;D to be verly enlightening:<br/>
http://www.podcast.net/show/29233<br/>
<br/>
Whenever one of the players seems confused about the rules, whenever the roleplaying seems very awkward (or boring) and generally whenever you feel the urge to hit the fast-forward button -- that's something to make note of.<br/>
<br/>
(If anyone else has podcasts of actual gameplay, I'd love to hear it!)                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Boardgames teach me a ton, particularly in the realm of creating "ratcheting" effects which handle the job of creating entertaining tension in the play experience for the player.  Shadows Over Camelot had a direct (though perhaps not obvious) impact on my design for Don't Rest Your Head.  Plus, the entry I made for the Compact RPG Challenge over on the Forge is sufficiently influenced by boardgames that it nearly *is* a boardgame.                        </div>
