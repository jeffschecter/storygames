                    I'm writing this with mixed emotions. I really wanted to like this game, and had high expectations; however, play was okay at best, and a horror of meta-communication, rules interpretation &amp; debate, and competitive deprotagonization at worst. This is partly due to the rules, and partly due to the players.<br/>
<br/>
The players had all scanned the rules quickly before we gathered. I then explained the rules, we tested out a few threats &amp; blessings, and then started play. During play, it became apparent that we really had no idea what sort of play was expected. What sort of core story is the game supposed to support? What kind of characters, situations and relations work best? We also weren't sure exactly who says what when, and came up with two possible structures: 1) "pass-the-totem"-play where anyone who gets narration (through blessings &amp; threats) keeps narration until someone else takes over (through blessings &amp; threats), and 2) PTA-like round-robin one-conflict-per-scene.<br/>
<br/>
Somehow or other, we ended up playing in a different genres than the rules imply. This was probably because none of us really know much about Indian mythology, history or fairy tales, and we needed a common understanding of the setting in order to know where we were going. We first tried a pulp-era "adventuring party" thing, with the "pass-the-totem" structure, which broke down into pure silliness as we started telling asinine stories about each others' characters. We'd somehow missed the (important) rule of only speaking in your character's voice (or narrating thoughts). There was little character ownership, and less and less investment in the story. Much of this can be blamed on the players. After about fifteen-twenty minutes of actual play I called timeout (fist + open hand) and said I didn't want to play like this anymore; the others agreed, and we restarted.<br/>
<br/>
We now tried to define characters, genre and central conflicts more strongly before play. We aimed for a story of interweaving plots. "Pass-the-totem" didn't seem to work, so we went for option 2: PTA-like play. For a while, it went pretty well. However, the threat system quickly lost its significance, as players started narrating strong threats: "Shut up, okay? This is a RAIL GUN I'm holding to your head." On the one hand, we were coming up with stuff like this on our turns; on the other, we were using the limited threats allowed by the system, which paled in comparison. There are, as far as I can see, no mechanical restrictions on using threats this way. The game worked pretty well for a while; there was dramatic tension, there were exciting plot twists, and the story escalated - though it was a bit bumpy at points, and there was a lot of "what the hell happens now???" after someone had thrown the plot in an unexpected direction. After we'd triggered the two divas &amp; the shiva lingam, it was time to leave the temple map. Two of the players were close to the exit, and just stepped out; after doing so, they narrated an epilogue, which made follow-up hard - I and the last player still had a few scenes to go before we were out, and able to finish the game. Things started getting silly very quickly after the two players on the outside lost interest, and we ended the game prematurely.<br/>
<br/>
In all, I feel we didn't play the game under optimal conditions - but I've played a <i>lot</i> of games with these players under similar conditions, and know it can work well with strong, clear rules. (Bacchanal, PTA, Dogs, local designs). The central problem was a lack of understanding how the game is supposed to be played, which led to floundering and lack of structure.<br/>
<br/>
I had the feeling I was doing a blindtest of a half-finished idea. I'm left with a feeling of frustration both at the group and at the rules. I know this feeling very well - it's one I've had many, many times when playing with rules that don't support play properly. I go into the session believing that I've understood the game's vision, try to convey it, find it just doesn't appear in play, and watch the game disintegrate as people lose interest. I hate when that happens.                </div>

<p>Hi Matthijs! Thanks for trying to play my game with your group; I'm sorry that y'all didn't enjoy it.</p>
<p>You've pointed out some important (deliberate) gaps in the text -- it's written in Rachana's voice, and she is writing for dancers, so it doesn't tell you anything about character/setting/situation/colour that you'd need for playing in the correct milieu.</p>
<p>I'm really curious about this:</p>
<p>bq. However, the threat system quickly lost its significance, as players started narrating strong threats: "Shut up, okay? This is a RAIL GUN I'm holding to your head."</p>
<p>So, like, was this accompanied by a threat or what? Without a threat, such a statement hasn't got any mechanical weight, but similarly accompanied by Simhamukha, it can mean, "You become suicidally fascinated by the gun, and can't pull yourself away," or whatever. "Just talking" implicitly doesn't impose threatlike conditions on anybody, acos you have to <em>agree</em> to being affected by threats.</p>
<p>Again this is something that's not really obvious in the text, and my more on-the-same-page group didn't pick it out; thanks very much for bringing it up so that I can talk about it in the little Mridangam supplement I'm working on.</p>

                            Some of the threatening statements were just made in character voice without being backed up by a threat gesture. They had an effect on play, and we took the consequences of such threats and acted on them. So they became a major feature of play, so much that mechanical threats sort of paled in comparison.<br/>
<br/>
We found we never negotiated threats - all threats were accepted, and the person who started the threat nearly always got narration.<br/>
<br/>
What do you mean by "Without a threat, such a statement hasn't got any mechanical weight"? What mechanical effect do threats have (except for being a way to gain/lose flowers)?<br/>
<br/>
A question on another level: You say these are deliberate gaps in the text. Does that mean you aimed to write a text that was incomplete as a game? (Or do you see it as a complete game...?)                        </div>

<p>Well, without a threat gesture, someone can't <em>forcibly inflict</em> an effect on you. He can point a railgun at your head and pull the trigger, but then, he has <em>no ability to specify what happens to you.</em> Threat gestures are the way that you make people react in specific ways.</p>
<p>So, basically, when someone points a gun at me and doesn't offer a threat, I read it as an invitation to disarm him, block/dodge the shot, act injured, his bullets are actually flowers that make me horny, I step onto the bullet and fly up to greet the sun, or anything else <em>I already wanted to do.</em> He's got no power over me. That's the mechanical weight; a gesture sharply restricts the ways that the victim may respond, while without one, the other player is just another dancer, and he's not actually telling me, "I want you to respond this way."</p>
<p>See what I'm sayin' here? The narration is on one level, and the pushy interactions of player authority are over on this separate level, in your <em>hands</em> and not in your <em>mouth.</em> You should never let yourself be dominated by words.</p>
<p>These are deliberate gaps in the text because the text is written in a fictional author's voice, toward a fictional audience - specifically, it is Rachana Melwani (a dancer) speaking to other dancers. Rachana doesn't need to tell the dancers about the setting and characters and so forth because they are professionals who know this stuff for a living.</p>

                            I see what you mean about the two levels of interaction. For various reasons, it didn't work out that way in our group at all; the use of words as a means of narrative control is, perhaps, something we're too used to, and that - for some - is almost second nature. Giving up this power, or consciously subordinating it to the mechanics, can be hard.<br/>
<br/>
What I mean is, some of us are used to saying: "So I bash him in the head with the candlestick! Then I do this and this to you, and so and so, and say these cool things." And, as long as there aren't <i>explicit</i> rules stopping the players, they're used to this being okay - first come, first serve. While it seems that in Mridangam, you're supposed to have an invisible line, a <i>feel</i> for exactly how far you can go before it's considered a threat (or, in some cases, deprotagonization or usurping of narrative control).<br/>
<br/>
This feel doesn't always manifest in a group; in this case, it was hardly there at all.<br/>
<br/>
Wrt the gaps in the text: I have to be frank; I assumed that the game would have complete instructions for play, for us, the real audience. I'm disappointed that it didn't; I more or less wasted an evening chasing something that didn't seem to be there. How has your actual play been? Have any other groups tried the game?                        </div>

<p>Sure! I've been there too -- the point I'm trying to make is, though, that that's <em>how the mechanics work,</em> and you're not really playing the game-as-written if you don't play that way. That's not a slur on you; if we didn't change the games we play as we play them, we wouldn't have design communities and so on. But it's hard for me to talk about how the game works and understand what went wrong and make it work better, when you didn't really play the same game, y'know?</p>

<p>Now, um, this is Just Wrong, I'm sorry to say. It's very clear when something is a threat and when it isn't; if you wiggle your fingers, it's a threat. If you don't, it's not. Lxndr said it to me this way: <em>Hands trump words.</em> This means, if someone picks up an elephant and hits you with it, you can throw up <em>Mayura</em> and see what they do, without saying anything. If they accept it, give you the narration, and hit you anyway, you have carte blanche; maybe that was Airavata, Indra's elephant, and now that guy has forever lost the favor of the gods. You don't have to say anything about how being hit in the head with an elephant affected you, because no threat required it. That's how threats work.</p>

<p>Did the text fail to dispel this assumption for you? I don't want to be the defensive designer here, I'm trying to figure out what was too sneaky and what was too obvious. It seemed to me, at least, that it was fairly clear that the document was something of an experiment in form-of-text as well as form-of-play.</p>
<p>The intention of the article is to give the reader something to think about, really, and the <em>tools</em> to make something that he can play, with awareness of the structural and communicative issues the game raises; I no more expect someone to play Mridangam out-of-the-box than I'd expect someone to play d20 system without any character classes and races, y'know?</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">

</div></blockquote>
<p>I have played the game a little bit, before the gestures and flower economy was finalised (which means, I clearly understand how-exactly-I-play the gestures, but am uncertain about the flowers), and basically I feel like it's essential to set down certain things before you play, most importantly a basis for the color and conflicts you're drawing from and a clear understanding of what the temple map represents; ask John Kim about his (uber-cool) prep work for his game to see what sort of stuff you need to do to make a playable instance.</p>
<p>Since we're talking about playung stuff from <em>PUSH 1,</em> by the way, Waiting/Tea is playable right out of the box, prep-free, and a billion times awesome.</p>

                            Glad you're still willing to discuss <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> since I'm not being very positive about the game.<br/>
<br/>
"Hands trump words" is a very good way of putting it; easy to remember &amp; understand. I think, also, that if we'd been more strict on narrating <i>intentions</i> instead of <i>results</i>, as the rules say, we would have benefitted from it.<br/>
<br/>
When reading the text, I assumed that the text around the mechanics, so to speak, was mostly flavor. I realised there wasn't much explicit instruction, but assumed that meant we could expect the essence of play to emerge from the mechanics as we used them. I didn't think of the game as a toolbox, but as a minimalist, tightly focused set of rules, with a very specific, narrow purpose.<br/>
<br/>
It's getting clear to me that I met the text with a set of assumptions, while you as a writer had other assumptions. Right now I have the feeling that I sometimes get when Sorcerer is being discussed: The text isn't the whole game - you have to meet the game with a certain set of references in order to understand it properly, and in order to make it work optimally, you need to prepare for the game in ways that aren't always fully described in the text.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I prefer being spoon-fed. I like rules to be clear about what to expect, to provide all necessary tools (or tell you what tools are lacking, and where you can find them/make your own), to communicate clearly and to emphasize and over-communicate the most important aspects of play. I like headings like "Setting up the game. The play round. Who narrates what when".                        </div>

<p>Oh yeah, absolutely. I do too; my basic goal with writing and designing games these days is to make games that help me do what I already enjoy doing, by teaching it to me and stuff. I'd much rather have a game text that gives me structures for doing the seemingly-obvious (monster creation in <em>Afraid</em>, frinstance) than one that doesn't hold my hand.</p>
<p>It's just that that wasn't how this particular text was supposed to be, is all.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for playing my game, and being so patient and articulate in our discussions! I leaned a lot, and it means a lot to me.</p>
