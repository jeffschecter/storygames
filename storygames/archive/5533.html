That seemed a little slow.  I attribute that to two things.  One, with the new edition I didn't know about a new card mechanic that put cards in the players hands so that they could gain Burdens for extra dice.  Brilliant and this would have pushed us forward significantly.  In one turn Patty only had two dice.  Adding more would have sped the process along nicely.  Secondly, I think I take my time with scenes.  I think my set up, intermediate narration and final narrations tend to be longer and more roleplay oriented.  I make certain we fit in a few sentances of dialog between characters and NPCs.  I'm okay with that but it means that I need to speed up character creation or have an extra hour (aside from using the card boost).  Alternately, maybe I should run with slightly less Star points to match my own pacing.<br/><br/>Here are some pics of the mess we lovingly created.  The players said they had a great time. <br/><a href="http://www.realityvault.net/photos/icestationnerdly/Ganakagok2-2-08.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" height="200" src="http://www.realityvault.net/photos/icestationnerdly/Ganakagok2-2-08.jpg"/></a><br/>Here is a map of our world it was sparse but effective with only three players.<br/><a href="http://www.realityvault.net/photos/icestationnerdly/Nitu2-2-08.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" height="200" src="http://www.realityvault.net/photos/icestationnerdly/Nitu2-2-08.jpg"/></a><br/>Here is the relationship map of the tribe.  A relationship at the very top was cut off noting that there was hate between Otoku and Rushik due to a rape (completely prior to the game and okayed through the lines and veils commitee - more importantly, generated by the player that it most effected).  Also at the bottom Moqoruk had a loving relationship with his grandfathers ghost.<br/><br/>This felt like a solid number of connections (Bill, Mel and I had been playing with a number of different options for how many connections would be established).  We covered most of the relationships.  I was kinda disappointed that we didn't really explore others but time and the direction of the story dictated other paths.  Rushik never did confront his killer, nor did Vanaqu and Otoku ever exercise their hatred for the mess over Rushik.  I could see where that would have been messy.  I created the hatred (although not the reason) and I wonder if that at all limited game play in that the two characters really didn't interact much.  Since players tend to only get in one anotehr scenes when supporting them they weren't exactly jumping at the prospect of a big hug fest.  On the other hand it would have been interesting to see roads in this direction and see the hate between them resolved and their ire turned toward Rushik.  I think I might develop this a little for a con scenario so we start with the characters and the general situation and just start by filling in the details.  <br/><br/><a href="http://www.realityvault.net/photos/icestationnerdly/tracking2-2-08.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" height="200" src="http://www.realityvault.net/photos/icestationnerdly/Tracking2-2-08.jpg"/></a><br/>Here is where I kept track of everything and wrote down some reference info for us to return to.  With a smaller group in a smaller space I could write it all on a one large sheet instead of the separate sheets we usually use.  This really was cool and intimate.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>- Don                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124206/#Comment_124206" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-03T17:42:25+00:00" title="February  3, 2008  5:42PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Don --\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: eruditus</cite>I didn't know about a new card mechanic that put cards in the players hands so that they could gain Burdens for extra dice.

But the enormous variability in numbers of dice to roll that was the result of basing it on a card draw was disconcerting to others. Giving people a hand of cards at the beginning of the game that they can use to "trump" the action in play by adding dice (as well as by narrating in a new situational element or exchanging the current situation or consequence card) struck me as a nice way of finessing that tension.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: eruditus</cite>I think I take my time with scenes.

Stylistically, as a GM, you are much less liable than I am to "go meta" and either "just narrate"/allow a player to "just narrate" or negotiate OOC about the point of the scene. Immersion, schimmersion, as long as we get to roleplay. My brother has pointed this out as a kind of weakness on my part: "Geez, Bill, you want to role the dice already? But nobody's <i>said</i> anything yet." I think the game is actually fairly forgiving of that difference, as long as the <i>players</i> don't feel deprived of spotlight time. And of course there are little bite-size roleplaying opportunities during the reaction phase, when players have to narrate in their character's Gifts to shift the dice.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: eruditus</cite>Alternately, maybe I should run with slightly less Star points to match my own pacing.</blockquote>.<br/>Fewer Stars is a good solution; I'm planning on reducing the "official" calculation anyway based on what I saw at Dreamation. The game runs better (I think) when the clock is more obviously ticking down with each turn. It seems to me that time is on Ganakagok's side: with enough turns, players can build up their Good Medicine totals and guarantee a happy ending for the island, the People, and themselves. With time pressing in, the choices are starker: who will be the one who sacrifices their own chance at happiness for the sake of the world?<br/>In any event, even if you don't get all the way to Dawn, it's pretty satisfying to just "call the game" when time is close to up and do the Morning turn, giving players a chance to narrate their own Final Fates as well as that of Ganakagok and the Nitu.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: eruditus</cite>I think I might develop this a little for a con scenario so we start with the characters and the general situation and just start by filling in the details.</blockquote>\nNow that's a nice idea.<br/><br/>Thanks for running it again, Don. I'm looking forward to hearing the AP clips.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/somelady" title="somelady"><img alt="somelady" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/somelady">somelady</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124209/#Comment_124209" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-03T18:06:07+00:00" title="February  3, 2008  6:06PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think the timing thing that I largely noticed was the roleplay vs "go meta" thing, since even when the countdown doesn't reach zero, when I've played before we've been able to wrap up the story pretty satisfactorily which we didn't get to do in this case.  I would've really like to get into it with Otoku.  Still really fun either way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
