There's no science to this, as you probably already figured out. <br/><br/>1) The stage you want to be at, from my perspective, is that the game is playtested some, and as a text is in a state where it's playable, but perhaps not precisely as "done" as you'd like the game to be. Slightly undercooked, you might say.<br/><br/>2) I'm not sure I'm following this question very well. Are you asking how much you might expect to pay to publish a product with low expense?<br/><br/>3) Other considerations are that you should keep an open mind and an open eye to whom bubbles up as interested in your game. They can self-identify as a target audience, and you start to build a better means to understand who the game is well-suited for. And that helps you figure out where to go, if anywhere, when you (later) finish and publish the game. Ashcan's are not strictly design or even publication design strictly. They are also a new marketing effort that help you gain a better footing on how to pitch, sell, and position your game product                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73808/#Comment_73808" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-05T11:33:51+00:00" title="June  5, 2007 11:33AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Matt. Answers!<br/><br/>1) No one has ever seen text. At this point the game is just in bullet-point form. I'm going to start working on the text soon. However, everything but the long-term play and one set of rules changes has been playtested (a half dozen playtests so far), with a major overhaul (size of which gets smaller at each iteration) after each one. I'm pretty confident about my writing ability and that I can have people read it and do blind playtests before mid July.<br/><br/>2) What I'm wondering is how produced does it have to be? How much art? How much work by smart layout folks? I can't really afford to pay for editors, layout people, and artists right now. If those kinds of things are probably necessary to have a good ashcan, I should wait. I'm really wondering about a dollar figure range, but maybe that's too big a question on too little data.<br/><br/>3) Dig. Thank you. I actually have a few boosters after the past two weeks of intensive missionary work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73812/#Comment_73812" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-05T11:40:50+00:00" title="June  5, 2007 11:40AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The bottom line is an ashcan is a means of getting people to pay you for something that you normally would be paying them for - playtesting your game.

That may be his preference, and the preferece of many potential customers. However, I don't think that's universal. I think people -- particulary the people you want to play the game -- are willing to pay for many formats of games. There are dozens of examples.<br/><br/>For example, Jared Sorensen put on an edition of InSpectres in 2002 or so that was basically a Word document and one of those office-supply binders with the pinching edge and acrylic covers. It was MEANT to look like a corporate document, which ties in with the game. <br/><br/>Jared also sold The Farm as a brown-paper-wrapped edition bound with rivets he punched himself. I believe that sold for $20. <br/><br/>My own upcoming ashcan for my game, 44, will have very little art. I will do the layout myself (although I've done layout for many, many books, and I've got a knack for it). It won't look shoddy! But, then, neither will it look like it came from an offset press with proper binding either. I'll likely use a local copy shop for the cover (the only art, which I'm cobbling together myself so far) and my own laser printer for the interiors. The copy shop will, hopefully, saddle-stitch the thing together for me.<br/><br/>In short -- nope, I see no <i>requirement</i> to have professionally edited, graphically designed, perfect bound editions loaded with art as viable, for-sale ashcans (or whatever economic model you wish to take).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73846/#Comment_73846" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-05T13:10:15+00:00" title="June  5, 2007  1:10PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can substitute close-to-done for flashy-looking.

Assuming that it isn't, do you have a feeling for what the game doesn't do? For the ashcan to help you fix the hole in your game, you need to know where the hole is. <br/><br/>3. Can you explain the rules well enough that someone can play/run the same game you are playing? A lot of us myself included know how to play our games but transfering the knowlege is tough. Have you tried watching someone else run your game?<br/><br/>4. Do you love this game enough to wait another year to publish it? after you get the word out and sell the game at gencon. people are going to go home and play it then they are going to write up play reports and you are going to be looking for the solutions and revising the text and then trying again. This will take lots of time. <br/><br/>I hope this helps to make your decision.

Because you don't pay playtesters. It may be true that they get some small amount of money in the video game industry. But I don't think that even the biggest RPG companies ever paid their playtesters.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could be very wrong about this, but I'd be very surprised. I've never <i>heard</i> of it happening, certainly. I've playtested many games, and have never even thought of asking for remuneration. I was pleased just to get in early.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy can people get away with getting "free" playtesting? Because it's "play" testing. It's fun. Or at least it can be.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that's the criteria. The game has to be fun to play. It can be damaged, even a small bit broken in places, quite imperfect. But if it's got some fun parts to it, and you can play the game enjoyably, then it's probably worthwhile for somebody to pay to pick up the game and try it out. This isn't work that we're asking for, it's asking for people to entertain themselves with our toys, and tell us how it went.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe're probably all agreed on this, and this might just be a matter of presentation of the same idea.
