Anyway, I liked it a lot. So much so, that I formalized the rules and added a bunch of stuff to them, in order to flesh them out a bit. cuz i r gaim ziner soz i ritez a gaymz.<br/><br/>It's called <a href="http://johnstone.wikispaces.com/file/view/Enter_the_Dungeon_20100322.pdf/129305057/Enter_the_Dungeon_20100322.pdf" rel="nofollow">Enter the Dungeon.</a><br/><br/>Check it out, I hope you like it.<br/><br/><br/>(PS: Feel free to comment here, of course, but if you'd like to give me feedback on the rules or just discuss them in-depth, we should maybe do that over on <a href="http://www.story-games.com/praxis/" rel="nofollow">Praxis</a>.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263355/#Comment_263355" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-22T08:36:15+00:00" title="March 22, 2010  8:36AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 22, 2010 8:39AM by DWeird.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks good! We'll definitelly playtest this at earliest convenience.<br/>\n<br/>\nI especially like the GM section of the rules and having to roll different-sized dies. It's a great innovation from the original and eliminates a lot of the, well, <i>bungling</i> that characterises this game's GMing...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm still going to call the system Roll for Shoes, though, as I find that name nifty, more memorable, and more in tune with my preffered theme of zaniness, which I believe this system supports much easier than regular dungeoncrawl. But I know for sure that people have used it for non-zany ends, so perhaps I'm wrong here?

I love simple, creative systems. For me, I read them and think "Why would I ever want something more toothy than this?" I know that's just my simplistic corner of the universe and I do like playing Savage Worlds, so I'm not trying to slam more complicated systems. It's just that Enter the Dungeon looks like a ton of fun and would certainly scratch the itch I have to play awesome fantasy exploration and mission-based games. I dig the addition of the roles (seeker, guide, and changeling). That's some strong mojo to add as a kickstart for the storyline.<br><br>Have you started a thread on Praxis?
