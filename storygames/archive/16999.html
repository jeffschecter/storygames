And I want to implement a slightly similar thing, but with a more focussed goal and set of rules -- hopefully you'll play along!<br/><br/>I think that the custom moves that exist in a world say a lot about the world.  The nature of the space, the apocalypse, the maelstrom, etc.  Whatever the moves are about is fundamentally shaped by the way mechanics and fictional elements are bound by the move.  So, I'd like us to collaboratively make an Apocalypse World setting in this thread.  Each of us gets only a single post ever (please!) in which we craft a single custom move that will exist in the same world with all the other moves in the thread.  So read the moves that have already been posted.  Think about what they mean -- what you see when you imagine that world.  And then post a move that is consonant with that vision.<br/><br/>I'll start:<br/><br/>When you <b>drink a double-handful</b> of the milky water that pools in the crater under the wrecked spaceship, take 1 harm (don't forget the harm move) and hold 1.  You can spend that hold at any time to grant someone (yourself or another player) +1 to open their brain to the psychic maelstrom.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386444/#Comment_386444" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-06T06:18:58+00:00" title="August  6, 2012  6:18AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When you open your Brain to ask about the Spaceship roll+hard instead. <br/>On a 10+ you get a neboulus awnser about it<br/>On a 7-9 it asks you to do something for it, if you do it, mark experience<br/>On a miss you wake up later, not knowing what you did but with a tatoo of a scarab that will go away after a few minutes.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist" title="Antisinecurist"><img alt="Antisinecurist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist">Antisinecurist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386445/#Comment_386445" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-06T06:29:13+00:00" title="August  6, 2012  6:29AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When you spend too much time (the MC'll give you a rough idea, but at least a day) in the caverns under the crater under the wrecked spaceship, roll+weird.
