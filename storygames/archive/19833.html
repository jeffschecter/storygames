I am having trouble figuring out where to start, and I have no one to talk to about this sort of thing.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord" title="SquidLord"><img alt="SquidLord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/690/n6I44LRPBAB7W.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord">SquidLord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439735/#Comment_439735" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-28T02:16:12+00:00" title="October 28, 2014  2:16AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>In the rough outline of the setting as described, what you\u2019re talking about really reminds me of X-Crawl, which was originally released for D&amp;D 3.5 but apparently has scene rerelease as Maximum Xcrawl with an intentional compatibility with Pathfinder.</p>\n<p>From the website:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In <strong>Xcrawl</strong>, the players are superstar athletes taking their chances in a  <br/><br/>   live-on-pay-per-view death sport. It\u2019s a modern-day world with a <br/><br/>  fantasy twist, and the game is simple: the Dungeon Judge, or DJ, <br/><br/>  creates an artificial dungeon under controlled \u2013 but lethal \u2013 <br/><br/>  conditions. He designs the maze, and stocks it with monsters, secret <br/><br/>  doors, magical traps, treasure and prizes. The players must go through <br/><br/>  the dungeon and fulfill whatever conditions the DJ puts forth in order <br/><br/>  to win.*</p>\n<br/> <strong>Xcrawl</strong> is a sport and the challenges are created, but the danger is no less real. <br/><br/>   If you die, you die. There are no second chances. <br/><br/>  Citizens of the North American Empire tune in every week to watch <br/><br/>  their favorite celebrities get eaten, paralyzed, turned to stone, and <br/><br/>  ripped apart. The nation\u2019s hunger for blood and mayhem grows with <br/><br/>  every contest. How will you fare?*<br/></blockquote>\n<p>Mechanically, I\u2019m not sure that introducing a new system is going to get you enough traction in the marketplace to attract attention. I could be completely wrong, but building off of someone else\u2019s successes is generally a pretty solid strategy.</p>\n<p>My own suspicion is that building off of one of the games that was released during the short burst of \u201cspy drama\u201d RPGs \u2013 <strong><a href="http://www.vsca.ca/Hollowpoint/" rel="nofollow">Hollowpoint</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://theunstore.com/index.php/unstore/game/88" rel="nofollow">Blowback</a></strong>, or <strong><a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/103822/Killshot-The-Directors-Cut" rel="nofollow">Killshot</a></strong> \u2013 would get you the vast bulk of the way to where you want to be in terms of system positioning. That all of the above have a sort of \u201cmission oriented\u201d design plays into what you\u2019re looking to achieve; even the dungeon crawling events are effectively just missions with specific parameters, which should work fairly neatly.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439744/#Comment_439744" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-28T15:20:42+00:00" title="October 28, 2014  3:20PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I know the first thing that came to mind when I was pouring this idea out of my head, was Xcrawl.
