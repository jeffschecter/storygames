The Rules Compendium is not needed, although it does have all the rules, the DM's Kit contains info from DMG1 and DMG2, some streamlined rules (which are actually preferable to start with, IMO), DM's Screen (what I've always figured is one of the most useful things back in the AD&amp;D days, rather than the DMG), monsters, treasure and play aids.<br/>-The Heroes of the Fallen Lands/Forgotten Kingdoms books aren't even necessary, they're handy to have as a hard copy, but $9.95 gets you a 1 month D&amp;D Insider Subscription with the Character Builder that's entirely up to date, and you can save it on your computer.<br/>-Related to that, the DM could just do that and have Adventure Tools with Monster Builder, and not need to get anything new for monsters, building anything new according to what they find on Deviant Art, cheap minis or what they can make with Lego.<br/><br/>So cost of entry is realistically under $40 (DM's Kit from Amazon + 1 month DDI subscription). <br/><br/>Realising that that's pretty much the complete D&amp;D game since 4th Edition launched, all up to date (if a bit streamlined) for roughly the cost of the average small scale RPG core rulebook, it's pretty exciting. The rest of the pricing for the line is equally encouraging as far as supplements go.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290238/#Comment_290238" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T22:21:38+00:00" title="August 30, 2010 10:21PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Robin, do you know how Essentials and the character builder interact?

PHB1 classes had a certain design that was widely disliked and wasn't continued with in PHB2, PHB3 or the Heroes of books, so while technically Heroes of the Fallen Lands isn't compatible with PHB1, neither is anything else in the D&amp;D4e line. It's highly likely that the classes in PHB1 will be redone in Essentials fashion, but with a different build selection, and they will become the official PHB1 classes from then on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290517/#Comment_290517" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T13:22:06+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  1:22PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Finally, <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/2010/8/23/" rel="nofollow">something substantive from Penny Arcade</a>.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Gabe</cite>Once we had characters it was time to play and honestly I don\u2019t think there is much difference between 4e and Essentials. I\u2019d say the biggest change is an overall simplification of the character classes. In my regular game the players are level 20 now and each of them has pages of power cards, items and feats. Even the fighter has a hundred different ways to hit someone with a sword. For the most part Essentials gets rid of a lot of this stuff. Sure the wizard had half a dozen powers but the fighter just hit things with his sword all night.<br/><br/>I guess the idea is to help get new players into the game without confusing them with a binder full of powers as well as get older players to come back. From what I\u2019ve been told this is a return to the roots of D&amp;D where fighters hit stuff and wizards were the ones with all the cool spells. Essentials attempts to solve two problems that I don\u2019t actually have, so it\u2019s hard for me to really comment on it. It does a great job of doing something I\u2019m not interested in doing.<br/><br/>My players all come from video games and almost all of them have played World of Warcraft for years. My wife felt very comfortable stepping into 4e because it felt like building a character in WOW. Even if she is a warrior she expects to see a ton of different powers down there in her action bar. The idea of only being able to do basic attacks from a couple different stances just doesn\u2019t cut it for most of the players I know. They certainly had fun with Essentials but I don\u2019t think any of them would build an essentials character to play in a regular game vs. a 4e character.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290601/#Comment_290601" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T16:12:22+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  4:12PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The podcast WotC released just after GenCON, with the recording of their panel/presentation regarding the next year of publications had a lot of info on the Essentials, I assumed it was all widely known stuff by now (I'm not even actively seeking them and I know).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, they said very clearly that the Essentials classes are just alternate builds of the base classes. The only problem I see is that they're introducing confusion using the same names for the classes... now people will have to specify if they mean PHB1 Fighter or Essentials Fighter.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut anyway, the E classes seem very clearly to be a step back from the "let's give everyone options and different things to do each round" philosophy that was at the base of the transition to 4E.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe new Fighter, apparently, has some new power/feats, a sword and hits stuff. Pretty much they seem to have ported the old (and mind numbingly boring, to me) classic DnD fighter to 4E, keeping it compatible with all the existing rules and balanced (hopefully) with more "complex" "full classes" from the PHBs. Same goes for the other Essentials classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure if the appeal here is to new players intimidated by 4E's complexity (could be, but I don't think I like their method (1)) or to the grognards that might consider trying the new edition now that they can play their old comfortable class again (plus, the nostalgia hook of the new Red Box, a product that's <i>explicitly</i> aimed <i>only</i> at nostalgic fans. New players should get the essentials(2))<br/>\n<br/>\n(1) And I should know. I started playing 4E last year knowing zilch of DnD (apart from the old elmore redbox in junior high) and I know I would NOT have played if the rest of my group was not composed by experienced players that guided me step-by-step to create my character and pointed me to some strategy/build guides, and so on. I say that I don't like their method because instead of writing BETTER FRICKING PROCEDURES (that are basically absent in PHB1) to help build characters step by step, including <i>copious amounts of examples</i> (practically completely absent from the PHBs, again), they went for the "dumbed down" versions of the classes... that might just prove to be boring!<br/>\n<br/>\nI just said I would not have got in the game because of its initial complexity... but I would not STAY in it without its powerful and vast world of powers, feats and combos... I mostly check the charop guides 'cause I don't have the time to read all that stuff in detail, but heck I would NOT play a Defender if all it did was stand there with high AC or HP and take hits (my storm warden dwarf is much more metal than that, thank you <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> ).<br/>\n<br/>\n(2) Their words, albeit paraphrased, from the podcast<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://media.wizards.com/podcasts/DNDPodcast_GenConDnD.mp3" rel="nofollow">Oh, and here is the podcast, give it a listen</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290929/#Comment_290929" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-01T13:57:51+00:00" title="September  1, 2010  1:57PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Each time of game appeals to a different play group. I used to be hugely against Burning Wheel charging you 1cp for a disadvantage, but then I thought about the overconfident/obnoxious personality/daredevil combination in GURPS - it basically gives license to one player to ruin any opportunity for tactful negotiation or well thought out strategy and forces the game into action, action, action - and the character gets points for it, not only being optimised for what's guaranteed to happen but completely nerfing a number of other characters. Burning Empires having scene quotas takes it even further - it's necessary with a certain group of players, but a problem for others. What about the player who doesn't want to be involved because he's shy, but likes being a part of the group by contributing to combat? D&amp;D 4e is great for that - everyone gets something to do, and the people who like to steal the spotlight do so in between combat, and for that group that's perfect. But there's also a problem, what about the player who doesn't like combat? There, the AD&amp;D mage is perfect, he gets to be involved a couple times, and helps out when it's really needed, so he's an important part of the group, but for the most part he doesn't fight and will be involved in roleplaying aspects more. Each system has a different set of balances (and also importantly, imbalances to cater to a diverse crowd). <br><br>Some people want to be able to just spam one thing, and would also enjoy pressing A/X in final fantasy 13, while others want complex and interesting options each time around. Robin's Laws would split them up as the butt kicker and the tactician, and D&amp;D Essentials offers that.<br><br>There's also something else, D&amp;D 4e as a system offers some great opportunities to play 2nd Ed style if you want to, but not everything matches up, it works much better for me to use D&amp;D Essentials builds for a Forgotten Realms campaign using all the 2nd Ed material I have than with the core D&amp;D 4e builds, which fit much better for Eberron (in my opinion anyway).<br><br>There are certainly people for whom it won't appeal, but for them, there's the Rules Compendium and all the books they already have, and for people who really like the Essentials options there's that, and they can both play together in the same game.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291003/#Comment_291003" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-01T21:01:35+00:00" title="September  1, 2010  9:01PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something that may present a problem that I discovered reading some live blogs on the red box is that at least one of the D&amp;D Essentials Fighter builds is a striker, which could create something of a problem if someone brings a fighter to the table and everyone says "Great, we need a defender."

I think 4e was initially for people who stayed on for 3.5 and wanted improvements, while Essentials is for people who bowed out around 3e. 4e has a number of qualities that make think it's more like 2e, but it also has a number that make it look quite foreign, and rather like Earthdawn instead. Essentials closes the gap there.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291348/#Comment_291348" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-03T08:06:17+00:00" title="September  3, 2010  8:06AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniel - I'm always most likely to cobble together my own game rather than use a commercial one but if I was going to do D+D again I'd want something simple rather than something complicated. I fell away from 3e because I just couldn't bring myself to learn all the little niggly stuff again. I ran some 3e at a local store and soon realized what I'd have to learn if I was to keep up with the kids. <br><br>Migo - I think what interests me about this is the advertising. They are waiving a game in front of me. My interest is peaked. I may spend money on it at Christmas. When they first released 4e it was like a whiff. 3e came out with fanfaire and I bought the players handbook at Gen Con. 4e came out with a deafening silence. It was weird. I didn't hear anything about the game for months after that. I've since come to realize they were speaking to an on-line community of WOW players. I thi8nk they made the right decision financially but it wasn't as much a show. <br/><br/>Chris                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291359/#Comment_291359" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-03T08:45:25+00:00" title="September  3, 2010  8:45AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're right, I discovered 4e by accident when I was in a bookstore, I was quite impressed with what they'd done, but I didn't even see much in game stores.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291444/#Comment_291444" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-03T13:20:51+00:00" title="September  3, 2010  1:20PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's weird: I "discovered" 4E because it was the buzz of the season on Story Games months before the release (almost all the previews seemed to show interesting choices and I was seeing many signs of lessons learned from Agon and other modern games), and my interest was piqued by the enthusiasm here *after* the release.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as I said elsewhere, I'm kind of a strange specimen here: I came to 4E with zero investment in previous iterations of DnD: I played with the Italian basic red box in junior high school, and that's it. All I've read and heard on the subsequent editions (ADnD1 and 2, 3.x) I pretty strongly disliked, actually (ADnD's rules madness) or I found very dull and boring (3.x pseudo-gurps "this rules can do anything").<br/>\n<br/>\nSo obviously all the "hear, hear, we're giving you back some of the oldschool" marketing WotC is doing these days does not have much traction with me <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n(I mean, check out their homepage today! <a href="http://www.wizards.com/DnD/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.wizards.com/DnD/</a> they even brought back Elmore)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
