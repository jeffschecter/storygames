They paint a painting, which is used to convey a message. Should the artist make a cultivation check to create a piece of tech (the painting) which is then used to support the ephemera check? Or should they just make an ephemera check? Can they gift the painting, or is that gifting ephemera and bad form?<br/><br/>2) Data is treated as a undifferentiated commodity, which can be gifted, or used to make memories using flood/bleed. Can specific pieces of data be used as tech? Can I use specific data, such as 'schematic of the flying monkey genome' to help me print a flying monkey? How do I convert "data", that undifferentiated mass, into something specific, like 'flying monkey genome'?<br/><br/>3) Imagine that my Freemer is a "memory artist", a person who converts their own memories into films as a form of self expression. How do I do this? Is this a flood/bleeding check or an ephemera check? Is making the film something I do with cultivation which creates a piece of tech I can use to support my ephemera check? What if instead of using my memories to create art I'm using them as evidence in some sort of arbitration. Can I turn them into tech then?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

Data can be traded, broken, gifted or thin-sliced. Data is not tech and cannot be used in challenges.<br/><br/>3) Ephemera would make her a movie director spreading short-term memories via her art.

There's a Flow cost. Each person in the challenge must pay it. The total Flow paid is then used at the end to compute efficiency rebates, so 25% not of the Flow cost, but of the total Flow paid. Then everyone gets that much Flow back. So if you've got 4 users paying 50 Flow apiece, that's 200 Flow, and 75% of it is 150, and they can each end up with 100 more Flow than they started with.

If I heard that my favorite style maven had been deathed by her husband, I would throw a frownie his way.  If I later learned it was all a switching set-up, I would forgive him and frownie the actual perp, as well as the switcher.  So I can easily imagine how certain actions or reactions might lead to PC's flow shifting up and down.  But just how likely is it in the freewheeling space future, whose mores and customs are strange to me?  I mean, how much does person P1 have to care about person P2 before my doing action A to P2 makes P1 give me a flow consequence?  How bad/good does action A have to be before they care?  These are all standards with which I'm not familiar, but if they were that semi-clear in my head, I could mock up a table cross referencing popularity with action, with an expected range of flow impacts.

How much flow did it gain or lose this session?  How do characters impact the flow (for good or ill) of multiple people at once?

Perhaps the "Free Lunch" doc, too.</blockquote>\nWell, re-reading that section was indeed what prompted me to ask the question.  But I think I see the source of my misunderstanding now: when it says "piece of data," it might really mean "point(s) of data," as in the game concept, not just anything expressible as information (like a speech or a report or a design or something).  But of course, the design of a piece of technology is probably what you get when you extract data from it.<br/><br/>Which leads, I think, to an amusing case where you can make a piece of tech, extract data from it, gift the tech to someone for flow, who can then extract data from it and gift that data to you for flow.  System-wise, all points of data are equally interchangeable, though you would expect them, fiction-wise, to be different.<br/><br/>...But then that leads to a case where you can build a circle of at least two people in different MRCZs with at least one point of data each who gift-cycle it once a session to gain flow.  Which obviously I wouldn't permit, but I don't yet see the clear line between it and the previous case.  <br/><br/>Anyway, thanks for explaining that, but it opens up two other questions for me:\n<ul>\n<li>When you gift data, is each point a separate gift, just as each item of tech might be?  Or is a gift of 3 data equal to a gift of 1, just like how the gift of a level 3 interface is equal, in the eyes of the Aggregate, to the gift of a level 1?</li>\n<li>In the section on thin-slicing conflicts Eppy comments "A canny thin-slicer can earn flow just by reviewing other people's tech. It's a total scam."  So what does he mean?  Before, I interpreted it to mean that you use thin-slicing to read the tags on some piece of tech, and then post on the station message boards about the tags you saw (especially if they include things like "prone to exploding"), and then get flow for gifting the review.  But that's not right.  Although, if each point of data is a separate gift, then a thin-slicer can "breed" data for flow, which also seems like a scam...</li>\n</ul>\nAlso, I don't recall seeing <a href="http://projectdonut.com/wordpress/?page_id=76" rel="nofollow">Free Lunch</a> before.  It's great!  It establishes reasonable limits and makes the rationale behind several of the system limitations much clearer.  I hope it'll be incorporated into the main text/box?\n<blockquote>Moderate: I don't know about you, but those sound like excellent questions to be answered in play.</blockquote>\nHmm!  It seemed like the text was making it an important point, but if that's only my personal view, then I'll let you know how it goes. \n<blockquote>Harder: Have you read the Making Trouble section? Otherwise, I'm not quite clear on what you're asking.</blockquote>\nIn general, I'm a big fan of reading the whole book before asking questions.  But I'm sorry that I was unclear.  Actually, re-reading my post, I'm sorry that I was nearly incoherent.  Jeez!  Don't worry, I've had some lunch now, I think I found the root of my concern.<br/><br/>It starts with this: when I'm the Superuser, as the users' MRCZ increases in size to be composed of mostly NPCS (especially NPCs who don't have complete stat profiles), how do I know how much flow it earns/loses in a given session?<br/><br/>If left to my own devices, I'd just use a table.  The better or worse the MRCZ as a whole is doing, the more flow it will gain or lose as a percentage of its current membership.<br/><br/>Really bad (almost 9 in ten members lost flow): lose 75%<br/>Pretty darn bad (3/4 of members lost flow): lose 50%<br/>not good (almost 2/3 of members lost flow): lose 25%<br/>just breaking even: no loss or gain<br/>net profit: gain 25%<br/>business is booming: gain 50%<br/>let the good time roll: gain 75%<br/><br/>All my other questions are really variations on: what do Freemers do to get MRCZs (their own and those of others) to move up or down on this table?  What form does their competition with one another take?  Is it all based on fads and thin-slicing?  What are the ways you can help increase or decrease the flow of a bunch of people at once?  <br/><br/>I guess the nuclear option is to social-engineer each founder to leave, so the MRCZ disbands, but that seems a bit grieftastic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242600/#Comment_242600" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-18T12:52:41+00:00" title="November 18, 2009 12:52PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 18, 2009 1:01PM by Daniel H..">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: NickNovitski</cite>In the section on thin-slicing conflicts Eppy comments "A canny thin-slicer can earn flow just by reviewing other people's tech.

As far as I know, a thin slicer doesn\u2019t gift anything.  Winning a thin-slicing challenge is enough to determine whether or not something is cool or popular (see the third part of each effect level for thin slicing on pages 44 and 45).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: NickNovitski</cite>The better or worse the MRCZ as a whole is doing, the more flow it will gain or lose as a percentage of its current membership.</blockquote>\nEnd of Session Flow for MRCZ Mates, page 110.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242602/#Comment_242602" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-18T13:07:34+00:00" title="November 18, 2009  1:07PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, regarding gifting circle jerks, page 50: "And you can only receive the flow boost from a gift once, no matter how many times you give it away."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickNovitski" title="NickNovitski"><img alt="NickNovitski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/192/nO35O3RI2BE32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickNovitski">NickNovitski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242603/#Comment_242603" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-18T13:11:06+00:00" title="November 18, 2009  1:11PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 18, 2009 1:19PM by NickNovitski.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>End of Session Flow for MRCZ Mates, page 110.</blockquote>\nI did forget that page, but now I remember why: that rule is completely random, beyond the user's ability to affect.

Sorensen</cite>In a world where genetic enhancement, perfect health, cybernetics, implanted software and super hi-tech rules the day, maybe sports aren't about winning and losing as much as providing an experience to the audience?</blockquote>\nI'll go you one better and argue the ephemeral nature of sports contests in the here-and-now.  But then how would you adjudicate a player making the agreement:\n<blockquote><cite>Freemarket Ephermera, 2nd Gen fiction</cite>\u201cIf the Marketeers <span style="text-decoration: underline;">can beat us</span>, we\u2019ll give them our best player...And if Moon Patrol <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wins</span>, we get the Doctorow Park public space.\u201d</blockquote>\nSeems difficult to see who gets what if there's no winning or losing.\n<blockquote> Besides, if you win the challenge with an effect of 3 you can (gasp) tell the Superuser that the audience has a memory of your team winning.</blockquote>\nYeah, that's why I assumed that indirectly competitive games (anything where victory is determined by a judge or judges) would be easily covered by ephemera.  Your gymnastic routine gives people the memory "The human spirit triumphs over all endeavors" and mine gives "Nature cycles endlessly through five elements," and then the Superuser can decide which one appeals more to the judge(s) in question.  But for directly competitive events, if both participants were invested enough, wouldn't they both create the memory "My team clearly demonstrated their superiority to the other team"?<br/><br/>...I ask that, but I just found a kind of answer!\n<blockquote><cite>Freemarket, page 53</cite>For self-targeted challenges, the user always initiates and the superuser always plays the target.</blockquote>\nSo <b>NPCs can't ever initiate Ephemera or Thin-Slicing challenges</b>!  Well that both makes sense and simplifies things immensely.  Cases where two users want to have an direct ephemera-off seem specific enough that we'd lose nothing by excluding them.\n<blockquote>If not, use Ghosting (to be swift and sneaky to get what you want) or Wetworks (to maim other players).</blockquote>\nOf course, then it's still up to the Superuser to decide whether either of those constitute sufficient conditions for victory.  It's fine to leave it in their hands, but it seems like it'd make it scary for the users, not knowing whether their efforts would be enough, or whether the Superuser "had a more interesting idea."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242701/#Comment_242701" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-19T09:02:24+00:00" title="November 19, 2009  9:02AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 19, 2009 9:02AM by Luke_Wheel.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, there's no judgement call going on here by some patriarchal authority.

What I'm questioning is my ability to determine which experience, if any, corresponds with a user's goals, and what guidance can be offered if the answer is "none."  <br/><br/>Again, the part that seems to matter the most is the jockeying between MRCZs.  As in:<br/><br/><i>My goal is to ruin that stupid baking MRCZ that make those stupid pies with the fortune inside!</i><br/><br/><b>You have to be more specific.</b><br/><br/><i>Okay, my Goal is to thin-slice a fad where everyone thinks the pies are stupid.</i><br/><br/><b>Okay, let's do that challenge...You succeed.</b><br/><br/><i>Awesome!  Are they ruined yet?</i><br/><br/><b>...Uh, their flow is lessened by an arbitrary amount, but I have decided that they're still kicking.</b><br/><br/><i>I kick them back!  What's something I can do besides thin-slicing, and how many times do I have to do it?</i><br/><br/>Feel free to imagine a calmer case where the user is trying to boost his own MRCZs flow.<br/><br/>In Certain Other Games, when someone tells me "I want to kill the Dragon," then I know to say "First, you must fight smaller monsters and gain resources.  Then we can start a conflict which, if you win, will mean the Dragon has been killed."  What is the corresponding explication here?<br/><br/>Is the answer none?  That's fine too, but if so, can you appreciate my confusion when reading a game that appears to be about competition which doesn't let you compete?

The role of the superuser is only to challenge the users by twisting their memories and presenting fucked up situations. <br/><br/>So when you thin-slice yourself to success, the superuser tosses the next hand grenade into the mix using the memory mash up system.

Wouldn't you make an absurd amount of flow that way?<br/><br/>Also, presumably there is some utility MRCZs that provide fresh water, electricity, garbage service, ect. How do they receive flow?

This is bad, because I cannot, as a Superuser, tell users how it is that they are being threatened, or competed against, or how they might threaten or compete right back.  (I do understand, from the paragraph before this one, that simply describing a MRCZ that is doing better than the users' without any hostility or interaction between them might also provoke user action, but that seems weak tea compared to "gunning" and "squashing".)<br/><br/>In the real world, I know that if company A launches an effective marketing campaign, that leads to increased sales for them, and decreased sales of companies offering similar products.  Or A might figure out a way to deliver a better service, or do it more cheaply, all of which actions would increase their bottom line, making them more successful as a company, and their competitors less successful.\n<ul>\n<li><i>How do MRCZs do this?</i> (ie, in the fiction)</li>\n<li><i>How do users do this?</i> (ie, in the system)</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickNovitski" title="NickNovitski"><img alt="NickNovitski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/192/nO35O3RI2BE32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickNovitski">NickNovitski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242856/#Comment_242856" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-20T08:27:29+00:00" title="November 20, 2009  8:27AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: KingstonC</cite>Also, presumably there is some utility MRCZs that provide fresh water, electricity, garbage service, ect.</blockquote>\nI thought that was all the aggregate's job?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242870/#Comment_242870" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-20T09:10:22+00:00" title="November 20, 2009  9:10AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2009 9:10AM by Luke_Wheel.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: NickNovitski</cite><br/>Great!

Impacting their ability to do that would presumably impact their individual flow, and therefore their group flow.\n<blockquote>And, it wasn't their thin slicing goal to knock them down a tier. It was their goal to trash their pies.

But what it doesn't say is that <b>when you win a challenge you get both your Goal <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> the purchased Effect</b>.<br/><br/>At least, that's what I understand you to be saying, since a MRCZ dropping a tier doesn't seem to be either data increasing in value, tags being read, or a fad being adopted; the three things thin-slicing effects can do.<br/><br/>So that's what I was missing.  The language of the text and thread convinced me that nothing was achievable except for the direct and delimited effects listed for the different experiences.  <br/><br/>So in the example in the Challenges chapter, could Tera's challenge have had the goal of making the party a success by making a pumpkin, rather than (apparently) just making a pumpkin?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[Freemarket] rules questions - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10915/freemarket-rules-questions/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="[Freemarket] rules questions - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10915/freemarket-rules-questions/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="No. You cultivate pumpkins, not parties.

It's faster than trying to make them drop tiers."<br/><br/><br/>*I'd say just have them come up for review at some point - happens to everyone at times. If it's important, though, then:<br/>Superuser: "to come up for review, the MRCZ's flow needs to drop below minimum. For that, either it needs to lose a tier challenge or all its members need to on average be losing Flow**. So go Social Engineer them to attempt to raise their tier, then (see previous) to make them fail, then (see previous) to make them fail the review."<br/><br/>**Thin Slicing others into not accepting their pies, frownieing them, etc. Wetwork each of 'em continually.

At the end of a session, to determine whether your MRCZ increases, stays the same, or decreases in flow due to NPCs, the superuser draws a single card from her challenge deck. If it is a geneline or experience card, nothing happens. If it is a freemarket card, their flow "has increased". If it is a hazard card, their flow "has dropped".<br/><br/>What precisely does that mean? It sounds to me like we're taking all the X other members and saying "freemarket: MRCZ gets +X flow, hazard: MRCZ gets -X flow". But it could be anything from +1 to +X, and from -1 to -X. I'm not sure the intent. If the - and + are the same, then it seems at first glance NPCs are on average harmful to your MRCZ's flow, since there are more hazard cards than freemarket cards.<br/><br/>But! What would I do as a user, if it were +X and -X? Seems I would pay attention to how well the superuser's been drawing this time through the shuffle, and try to force a reshuffle before the end of the session if there are lots of hazards left in her deck, or avoid a reshuffle if lots of hazards have already come up. I'm not precisely sure how much this increases my MRCZ's expected Flow change, but if the session routinely ends either just after reshuffle or with some very small number of cards left, I'd say a good bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242977/#Comment_242977" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-20T23:13:59+00:00" title="November 20, 2009 11:13PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's very astute, Guy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ignotus" title="Ignotus"><img alt="Ignotus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ignotus">Ignotus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243025/#Comment_243025" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-21T11:49:05+00:00" title="November 21, 2009 11:49AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Guy Srinivasan</cite>But!

And those are kinda incompatible, right? In contemporary social media games, you often have random folks you don't know affecting your quantified social capital (+1s, Likes, etc.) in ways that are hard to replicate in Freemarket. On the internet, sometimes you just wake up and a bunch of folks in Lithuania have discovered something you did and you get microfamous for a week. In Freemarket, if the SuperUser just hands somebody 100 flow for no reason, it feels weird, partially because the game is kinda driven by poverty (in the way old school D&amp;D is, never enough flow to do everything you want) and there are a limited number of specific ways to get flow.  I was never able to figure out a functional way to satisfy both impulses. Maybe random "How did my flow change since the last conflict?" tables would work, I don't know. My sense is that freemers are constantly aware of their flow, though, which makes it still weird. So I guess my advice is to say "Abandon the idea that the Freemarket economy works like Facebook" and embrace it for what it is, a mixture of Facebook and Dickens. You gotta pay the cost to be the boss!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374398/#Comment_374398" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-25T18:32:46+00:00" title="April 25, 2012  6:32PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hans c-o</cite><br/>Anyone have a judgement on this one?<br/> <br/><i>A Switching Challenge is always at Aggregate-class Flow.

I know the culture of Freemarket is that things are given away for free all the time. So: When the users constantly burn tech &amp; interface, do they just go to a mobbing MRCZ and get that shit back for free? All the time? The first time they did it, I let them get it for free. The second time, the mobbing MRCZ wanted some favors from them.<br/><br/>Last session, a character wanted to get some tech printed. So I had the printers make a contract and give it to them if he could convince this other guy to join up with their MRCZ. Is that kosher, or should I be just giving them all the shit they ask for, no strings attached? I'm worried that that will make the game boring and/or there will be no consequences for burning. On the flip side, when strings are attached, the users have said it feels like they have to do a bunch of meaningless errands to get what they want, and they can't actually go for their goals (personally, that critique sounds weak to me: If you want to get this printed stuff, or mob all your burned interface back, then that's what you're doing instead of going after your goals). Anyway, clarification on just how free to be with things would be helpful! I realize I'm hedging my bets a little with my "good" GM instincts, so take that for what it's worth.<br/><br/>2. <b>Do they have to do a Flood/Bleeding challenge when they want to give a memory to someone?</b><br/><br/>Our MRCZ, Re/!/Mem, deals in memories. So a situation came about last session where one MRCZ member (QRA) wanted to bleed memories out of another member (Urlo) and then do something else with those memories. Urlo was totally cool with this, and willing to give him the memories. Do we do a Challenge for this? Or can he just bleed those memories right quick? My instincts were that it's a challenge, but the users thought it probably shouldn't have been. Also, then QRA wanted to Flood this memory into a brain-tank (piece of tech), and I made him do a Challenge for it. The users seemed to agree that this definitely was a challenge. So, should it have been?<br/><br/>3. <b>NPC MRCZ-mates in Challenges</b><br/><br/>Can't for the life of me find this in the rulebook, but I seem to remember something about NPC MRCZ-mates being able to help you in a Challenge. Page numbers will suffice.<br/><br/><br/>Thanks folks! I love this game, and you are helping to make me a better Superuser for when I roll around to your town and run it for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

Does the person/thing the character is going against have a lot invested in this Challenge? Do they really not want, or want, something to happen? Those kinds of things tend to get more flow than if the target doesn't care that much. Of course, if the target doesn't care at all, it's not a challenge.<br/><br/>It's become very interesting to me how there are two very different things going on in a Challenge. Setting the Flow Investment is about asking the User, "Is it worth this much to you?". Setting the Difficulty is about asking the User, "Can you do this? Will you get what you want?" My thinking on this hasn't developed very far, but there's a lot going on there.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382516/#Comment_382516" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-16T06:35:05+00:00" title="June 16, 2012  6:35AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Last question (probably): for the Burn action, is it appropriate to Burn anything in any Challenge?

It certainly went out with a bang. One session of Character/MRCZ creation, six of play. A brief summary to give context to my question (I also posted this in bite-sized AP June 2012):<br/><br/><b>NOTE: The following story contains violence toward a pregnant woman.</b><br/><br/><i>The MRCZ, Re/!/Mem, is all about "finding the perfect experience". They've danced around this goal for six sessions. Through an artistic performance they've made 6.3 Jen (a sometime girlfriend of one of PCs) want to get pregnant, on her own, and experience the bonds of motherhood. Forty days later, they bring her into Re/!/Mem HQ to ask if they can take her gestating baby's first memory. She's hesitant. They Socially Engineer her. "This will be a breakthrough in science. Knowing the first memory of a human infant will be an historic moment." She gradually sheds her hesitation and agrees to it.<br/><br/>The baby's memory is "the shocking bliss of being brought into existence and being one with another being." A couple of the PCs pass the memory around, experiencing it. Jen leaves. After quick discussion, Re/!/Mem decides to death Jen, as she could be a threat to them using this memory for mercenary purposes (have people line up, sign a contract, experience the memory, and give it back*). It's a Perfect Death, 6.3 Jen being garroted, gassed, and bashed in front of Re/!/Mem HQ. When her body is re-printed, there's no baby.<br/><br/>The session spiraled from there, with the two responsible for the deathing being frownied into oblivion after Jen's MRCZ--the Pie Shoppe--Thin Sliced the video feed of Jen's death all over the station. One tanked PC Switched at the last minute to avoid being booted off the station, one gave up in disgust and voluntarily left. The other two PC members of Re/!/Mem were left to pick up the pieces, one of them still holding the memory.</i><br/><br/>So, I feel very conflicted about the consequences of deathing Jen.<br/><br/>(1) On the one hand, the users were very aware of how deathing fit into life on the station. They knew it was hazardous, and that doing things that made people unhappy had the potential for mass-NPC-frownie (one user in a previous session had ridden along with a Breaking MRCZ, watched them get caught, tank, and booted off the station). I felt like the users were being anti-social according to station standards. They had this friend who had given them something very unique and beautiful. They wanted to figure out how to use that to get more Flow. Ok, a bit mercenary maybe, but that's fine; there are mercenaries on the station. But then they went and killed 6.3 Jen in cold blood because she <i>might</i> be a threat.<br/><br/>As we were clear this was going to be the last session, I felt I had a bit of a freer hand and realized what the consequences would be: this horrible act, that didn't fit the social mores of station life (it wasn't a contracted death or a wetworker just doing his job), would be Thin Sliced by Jen's MRCZ (who knew she was heading to Re/!/Mem HQ when they last saw her), people on the station wouldn't find anything redeeming in it, and the users responsible would be mass-Frownied and tank.<br/><br/>(2) On the other hand: Pretty harsh move. One user responded by Switching desperately and barely managing to save his ass. It was a tense scene; very exciting. The other user had felt the session had broken down after Jen's memory was taken (he felt that should have been the end of the session and game, but communication wasn't clear between us all on that issue), and somewhat in frustration he had his PC just give up and leave the station.<br/><br/>(3) So: was I, as a Superuser, within my bounds on that call? It felt kind of like GM fiat, but it also felt like I was following the rules of the game and the rules of the setting and previously established fiction** in deciding that. What do you think?<br/><br/><br/>*If you've read <i>Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom</i>, then you are thinking this is Freemarket's version of flash-baking. I was so excited when the group discussed this possibility (I believe none of them have read the book).<br/><br/>**for full context, there was a time previous when a user had been deathed after stealing someone's memory, but he and the Wetworker who killed him became fast friends afterward, so perhaps that may have colored the group's view of Wetwork.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383811/#Comment_383811" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-28T18:29:09+00:00" title="June 28, 2012  6:29PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2012 6:29PM by Hans_c-o.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting: I was reading back through some FM threads, including this one, and upthread I asked this question: Can the SU "arbitrarily" (based on the fiction) distribute Flow? And Luke said No. Which made, and makes, sense to me.<br/><br/>And then I basically asked, in the post right above this one, "Can the SU 'arbitrarily' (based on the fiction) distribute Frownies?" No one answered, but Luke gave me a cryptic whisper, and, thinking about it more, I feel like the SU is totally within-bounds to distribute a bunch of Frownies for pre-established anti-social behavior.<br/><br/>There's no mechanism, fictionally or in the real world, for characters or users to give each other huge Flow boosts (3 Flow from Attaboys is the limit--in our game we forgot that users can only <i>receive</i> one Attaboy per session), though there is a mechanism, fictionally and in the real world, for the Superuser to give users huge Flow <i>drops</i>. You can receive one Attaboy per session, but you can get Frownied approximately 80,000 times.<br/><br/>You have to work to get the Flow you need, and it's easy as shit to lose it--depending <i>entirely</i>, of course, on how you play. By all accounts, the Users in our game rocketed up in Flow without <i>too</i> much difficulty: most of them were in triple-digits by the third session of play. And then, in the sixth session, issues that had kind of been festering in the fiction for a while exploded, and two characters fucking <i>tanked</i>--because of a truly soulless decision they made.<br/><br/>Are you a member of the station? Does it change you? Do you try to change it? How? Do you rebel and break shit? Have fun on Mars, sucker. Do you tilt your group in the direction you want to go? Do you win friends and influence people?<br/><br/>I don't know if I'm effectively communicating this, but I feel like I'm understanding something about this game (that I thought I understood) on another level. It's not coming out the way I want it to. Freemarket will not leave my brain.<br/><br/>I'm running it this weekend for a round of fresh-faced newbies.

At the end of a session, to determine whether your MRCZ increases, stays the same, or decreases in flow due to NPCs, the superuser draws a single card from her challenge deck. If it is a geneline or experience card, nothing happens. If it is a freemarket card, their flow "has increased". If it is a hazard card, their flow "has dropped".<br/><br/>What precisely does that mean? It sounds to me like we're taking all the X other members and saying "freemarket: MRCZ gets +X flow, hazard: MRCZ gets -X flow". But it could be anything from +1 to +X, and from -1 to -X.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Four player members, each can earn one flow for the MRCZ per session.<br/>The rest of the MRCZ is represented by a card draw that can potentially add another point of flow.</blockquote>\nSo, I have 18 people in my MRCZ, and the 3 of us are users. The other 15 are npc on the station we've recruited. When it comes to the end of session, the superuser draws a Freemarket card. Does the MRCZ get +15 flow or +1 flow?
