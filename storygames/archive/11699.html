They range greatly in terms of complexity.  Two clever ones I've heard of:<br/><br/>Repairing a spaceship.  There was a lego model representing the completed engine.  To complete the goal, the players had to create a copy of the model, using legos they collected or purchased or traded for throughout the game.<br/><br/>Defusing a bomb.  This consisted of a simple electronic device (I've seen them used for other purposes - maybe you can buy these as toys?).  You pass a loop of wire along the length of a much longer wire which twists and turns; if the two wires touch, a circuit is completed and the device beeps - BOOM!<br/><br/>Other stuff is simple - some kind of solitaire card game to represent hacking, for instance.<br/><br/>If this is the sort of stuff you're looking for, I might be able to put you in touch with a friend of mine who's active in the MIT larps (these examples come from his anecdotes).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260937/#Comment_260937" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T09:29:42+00:00" title="March  9, 2010  9:29AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yikes!<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to hearing what people have to say: this one is hard for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260938/#Comment_260938" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T09:34:50+00:00" title="March  9, 2010  9:34AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude, I was just watching someone defuse a bomb on Burn Notice a while back and I was like, man, how great would it be to emulate timed constraints with minigames!

Then, the player assembles a meaning out of the finished text.

Not sure how to make that into a minigame, but one of the upshots is that it foregrounds language as a communication tool, rather than a code (it punctures the "language of thought" hypothesis).<br/><br/>But a lot of interesting deciphering problems seem to be ones of interpretation rather than substitution.  I own a French-English dictionary, and so could brute force my way through, say, _No Exit_.  But I'm unlikely to really understand it.  If you want an interesting puzzle that's not a code of some sort, maybe give the players something like a (partial?) very literal translation - then they have to use their own ingenuity and exploration of the ancient tablet's history and context to make *sense* of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RichD" title="RichD"><img alt="RichD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RichD">RichD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260970/#Comment_260970" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T10:48:45+00:00" title="March  9, 2010 10:48AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>How do I encrypt the secret message? </i><br/>\n<br/>\nMake a Scytale? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scytale" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scytale</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260975/#Comment_260975" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T11:01:10+00:00" title="March  9, 2010 11:01AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>How do I hunt food to feed the village?</blockquote>\nfill a bag with 100 beads/objects/coins.  place x number of similar shaped/textured/weight/size objects to represent food.  vary difficulty and complexity via how similar the target is to the control item.  have Player blindly draw over specified time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260976/#Comment_260976" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T11:11:58+00:00" title="March  9, 2010 11:11AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2010 11:36AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://web.mit.edu/foley/Public/Mech/index.html" rel="nofollow">MIT's resources of awesomeness</a><br><br>EDIT: This is unbelievably cool.

A big chunk of the preparation for a game can be finding interesting, unique and fun mechanics to fill in for various real-world activities that are part of the game. Then there's the additional challenge of handicapping for character skill. There's a very long tradition to be mined here, and unfortunately I don't have the time to do more than wave vaguely in that direction. If it's helpful, I can put you in touch with some of the LARP designers around the Washington DC area who are very experienced in this sort of thing.

Perhaps players have a set time limit (determined by character skill level?) to get X number of pieces out of the bomb in order to defuse it.

When a hunter kills a beast (Using darts? Bocce?), they get a number of tokens, depending on the animal.  So bears might be tough to kill, but give a lot of food tokens.  Rabbits might be tough to catch but give very little.  Dodo birds are easy to kill but give very little.  <br/><br/>When the hunters return to the village, the tokens are cooked in a pot and thereby transformed into action tokens (perhaps they also need tokens from the gatherers in the village?).  Action tokens are the basic currency of the game for other tasks, so everyone wants them.  But there's only so much food to go around, so everyone has to hash out how to subdivide the action tokens when they get them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260989/#Comment_260989" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T11:42:12+00:00" title="March  9, 2010 11:42AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, hey, <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/" rel="nofollow">geocaching</a>.

Have the GM go around the LARP area ahead of time with a GPS device, hiding small packets of stuff around.  Then during the game, the player gets the GPS unit and can acquire directions to the hidden thingies.  Perhaps other players have the directions, but no GPS unit.  Perhaps the player gets the instructions via completing other tasks or minigames.  Perhaps he starts with a list of ten locations, but only one or two have what he's looking for.  Perhaps the GPS unit has a limited number of uses or battery life.<br/><br/><br/><a href="http://www.amasci.com/amateur/irgoggl.html" rel="nofollow">This page</a> describes how to build a set of Infrared goggles for under $10.

What if you just get (or fabricate similar) a set of <a href="http://www.fatbraintoys.com/toy_companies/think_of_it/frigits_deluxe.cfm" rel="nofollow">Frigits</a> and make them get marbles from one point to another on a magnetic surface using too few elements to make it trivial?  (Oh, and also, these are just fun to have around -- we bought ours 12-13 years ago before they went to plastic and the kids (of all ages) love them.)<br/><br/><b>How do I navigate through dangerous shoals?</b>  Model underwater hazards with objects fixed to the bottom of a shoe-box. Obscure the interior with some blue fabric stretched across the top with a grid of squares marked out.  The navigator has a thin metal rod that can be poked through the cloth to feel the depth of the bottom at a given grid coordinate.  There should be some in-game pressure to go fast so that the player(s) must decide how many soundings they get before being forced to the next row.  Their soundings will inform their steering decisions.<br/><br/><b>How do I synthesize a chemical in a lab?</b>  Provide the player(s) with a few test tubes, a normal set of food colors, some water and a paint chip (from the paint section of the hardware store -- you can have several and choose one at random each time this challenge is invoked).  The players must closely match the color of the paint chip given the resources provided.  This is something that most anyone will succeed at, so they need to be racing the clock.<br/><br/><b>How do I decipher an ancient tablet without using a tired substitution cipher?</b>  Maybe you could do something with syntactic/semantic ambiguity.  Perhaps provide a few sentences that can be interpreted with multiple meanings and have the player interpret them.  See examples <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_ambiguity#Examples" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_path_sentence" rel="nofollow">here</a> and the analysis of "time flies like an arrow" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing#Concrete_problems" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  <br/><br/><b>How do I hunt food to feed the village?</b>  For hunting, put silhouettes of birds on the wall and have the player shoot some limited number of spit balls at them with a straw or pen-case.  For gathering, play a concentration/memory card or number game.<br/><br/><b>How do I compose a symphony?</b>  Provide the player with twelve small noise-making items (bells, electronics, finger cymbals, taught strings, whatever) that the player must place on a 3x4 grid such that every adjacent pair shares some attribute that the player lists.  You award a point for each pairing that you buy, an extra point or two for anything the coolness of which surprises you and maybe bonus points for speed.<br/><br/><b>How do I bug the embassy?</b>  Give a map of the office suite to be bugged to the players.  Then provide them with some plastic templates of where the bugs are good for listening made to scale with the map.  There could be directional and non-directional.  Larger bugs might provide clearer tranmissions.  Each piece of hardware they have available has a risk and quality as well as a coverage template.  Something like Quality * Coverage / Risk  is their score?  Or maybe have them dress in utility coveralls and crawl silently through ductwork.<br/><br/><b>How do I encrypt the secret message?</b>  Provide a one-time pad and a strict time limit.  Count down while they work to keep them sweating.  Take it away as they're still writing when the time is up.  Make them obliterate the pad when done.  Have another player decrypt it with their copy of the one-time pad.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261254/#Comment_261254" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T11:41:05+00:00" title="March 10, 2010 11:41AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2010 11:44AM by Tulpa.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>How do I decipher an ancient tablet without using a tired substitution cipher?</p>\n<p>A double acrostic made from Lorem Ipsum.</p>\n<p>How do I encrypt the secret message?</p>\n<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybius_square" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybius_square</a> is nice and accessible.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261257/#Comment_261257" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T11:44:42+00:00" title="March 10, 2010 11:44AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><br/>How do I bug the embassy?</blockquote>\nIn a LARP?  Two words: baby monitor.  <br/><br/>The spy team tries to hide the mic/transmitter part of the monitor in the room well enough that it won't be found.  But they need to place it centrally and openly enough that it can pick up sound and transmit without interference.  If the other team discovers that the room is bugged and/or finds the monitor, the bug is destroyed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Actually, a baby monitor surreptitiously hidden in your gaming room could work for tabletop purposes, too.  When Group of PCs A is spying on Group B, the GM sends Group A out of the room "so that they don't know what Group B is doing".  But Group A goes in the room with the other half of the baby monitor, and can hear some (but maybe not all) of what happens to Group B.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261259/#Comment_261259" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T11:48:54+00:00" title="March 10, 2010 11:48AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2010 11:52AM by Tulpa.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>How do I synthesize a chemical in a lab?</p>\n<p>Make ice cream by hand.</p>\n<p>Alternate: make tofu out of soy milk by hand.

Attach bells to the line. Send in the PCs--if a bell rings, Bad Things.<br/>* Agility Check - A balance beam about 6" off the ground (or just a 4x4 on the ground). Cross it without falling off (while being barraged by Evil Magicks\xae). Fall off, Bad Things.<br/>* Wooden Keys - A simple piece of wood, with a unique shape cut out of it to make a "key." Then, several similar (but non-fitting) keys are also made. Find and fit the right key under time pressures, or Bad Things. (This is how any sort of lock and key is made in the local LARPs that I've attended.)<br/>* Hacking A System - Pick your favorite number puzzle (e.g. Sodoku) and require it to be completed (accurately) to bypass it and open... whatever: a computer file, a safe, a magically-locked chest. You can even include "skill levle" (i.e. soft skills) by allowing a PC with a high "hacking" or "cryptology" to do an easier puzzle (attach a Hard, Medium, and Easy one as assign skill ranges to attempt the easier ones).<br/>* Minigames - I've seen pics of a French Star Wars LARP actually using <i>X-Wing v Tie Fighter</i> to determine how a ship-to-ship battle went--the pilot PC was the only one would could sit down to play the game (and they did some cool shit with the set hiding the computer running the game). Other games use minis rules to resolve large set battles (i.e. army v army, not just a large field battle for present players) that crop up over the course of the live game, sometimes even during the game's uptime. Generalizing this method is an exercise for the reader.<br/>* Blindfolds - All sorts of things can be simulated by just blindfolding someone and giving them a simple manual task, like stacking blocks or sorting coins into piles by denomination.<br/>* Encryption - There's whole sites devoted to this, but a simple way to encrypt in-game messages is to use a common book, and let the receiver know what page you're using to encode. Then, find the word you want on the page, and use its number (i.e. the count of the word on the page). That's basically substitution, but it involves a 'real' method and the PCs could have a field day deciding which book(s) they will use in-game to encode (e.g. the monastic order might use a specific King James Bible; the thieves guild might use a specific edition of The Anarchist Cookbook, etc).<br/><br/>I'll dig a bit at RPG.net--there's an old thread which is basically asking the same thing that you are: how can hard skills be employed in a game for things other than boffer/Airsoft combat?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RivoClavis" title="RivoClavis"><img alt="RivoClavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RivoClavis">RivoClavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261492/#Comment_261492" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-11T14:43:21+00:00" title="March 11, 2010  2:43PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For chemical synthesis or analysis play like real chemists using <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_model" rel="nofollow">molecular models</a> The trick would be how many clues to give the players before hand, either based off pure skill or a check and then let them loose on the model materials to build a molecule that fulfills the requirements of the target (number of different atoms or just plain molecular weight, active groups or connections).<br/>\n<br/>\nIts fun no matter how much chemistry you know, everyone loves coloured spheres.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
