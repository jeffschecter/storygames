We were tree players, and what I loved most about the game except for our ([Fiasco]-like) epilogues and our astonishing success, was that it was really easy to help each others with building a character-within-a-crew. I played the consumate veteran .Coil, maybe 120 years old (the aging effects of our ghost worlds made it difficult to tell, drank a lot of rejuv-juice). Player One played .Grip, our tough and robust and resolute .crew-leader. It was a real pleasure to back him in everything, before shaking my head and speaking up against the stealing of a government pumping-station, a job referred to as a ".station-lol". Player 2 played our young, skilled, though overly ambitious tech'er .Hull, who had an addiction to buying techs and upgrades, I've surmised. I was found to admire his bravado, as I really couldn't consider anything other than .Ghostrunning. <br/>\n<br/>\nI loved how the game let us players just define our skills and props as we went. After firing (killing) our 'jumper' because he blocked .Grip when he was hit with a sniffer-trace, we decided to get my old wife .Wight, who was also .Grip's ex-lover, to help us make the transition to the Ghostworld. In a break, I just got Player 4 to play the .crystal-junkie .Wight, The addition of a fourth player worked like a charm, and the GM instructed brilliantly and the player responded with a similar performance. We all got the .station-lol operation going as a team, as .whight was a "jumper" that followed into the Ghostworld. <br/>\n<br/>\nSwitch was found as the one who sold us out, after gauding his wife in a stripping joint, and some great .net-tracing from .Grip., while .Hull set up the .Station-lol (job). After a great success, we all retired, though we had some tough spells. .Coil barely made it and one ghostworld-manipulation error more would make him a ghost.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe retired in New Hong-Cong (or was it New Holm-Con?)<br/>\n<br/>\nEpilogues:<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter taking care of some business, .Coil had to start his own crew to get his fix.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe channel .Hull opened after our success (.Station-hull) was always grey, to the fresh ghostrunners' chagrin.<br/>\n<br/>\n.Wight went back to .Switch after betraying us (for .Crystal I presume).<br/>\n<br/>\n.Grip would do just one more run...   <br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------<br/>\nThanks to John Harper for making the game!<br/>\n<br/>\nOur GM had played a few times before, I'm sure that the great group had something to say with the experience. I look forward to trying the game at an other time.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365373/#Comment_365373" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-05T16:31:52+00:00" title="March  5, 2012  4:31PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fantastic!
