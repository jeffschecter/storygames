We determined to start the game in a "The Prisoner" style prison on Gehenna in the LeGuin system.  We've seen some nice hints at the nature of each of the PCs but they're a bit constrained by the unusual situation they find themselves in.<br/><br/>We're hoping to bust out next time and also to become more familiar with some of the Diaspora-specific Fate mechanics beginning with Social Combat.  We're planning to try to elevate Emmanuel's position as a "favorite" of "Father" in the prison and see if that gets us access of some kind, either to him or to the Brindi Sultan's daughter, Naina, who's being held somewhere beneath the prison "town" of Resignation.<br/><br/><a href="http://diasporadical.wikidot.com/" rel="nofollow">Here's</a> our game's wiki.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244981/#Comment_244981" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T19:04:17+00:00" title="December  3, 2009  7:04PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2009 7:28PM by nemomeme.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's my character.  I might change some of his Aspects.  I really adore/hate him so far.  I realized a few weeks ago when we were making our cluster that I'd played mostly pacifistic and mostly pretty admirable characters in my three previous longer-running games: Sorcerer, PTA, and Burning Wheel (ongoing).  Tylos is <i>deeply</i> flawed.  I imagine he'd be played better by Remi, but I'm doing my best and having fun with him, chewing the scenery a bit.<br/><br/><b>Tylos Fell</b><br/><br/><b>Aspects</b><br/><br/>    * This Is What You Get!<br/>    * Scavenger Of Necessity<br/>    * Pyrrhic Strategist Supreme<br/>    * Everyone Else Is A Pawn<br/>    * Veteran Of A Thousand Psychic Wars<br/>    * Starke Choices<br/>    * Hail Naina, Full Of Grace<br/>    * No Good Deed Goes Unpunished<br/>    * Out Of Command, Out Of Control<br/>    * Desperate For Something Else<br/><br/><b>Skills</b><br/><br/>5 Tactics<br/>4 Brawling; 4 Intimidation<br/>3 Agility; 3 Navigation; 3 Slug Throwers<br/>2 Alertness; 2 Profession (Soldier); 2 Resolve; 2 Vehicle<br/>1 EVA; 1 Culture/Tech (Clarke, Haldeman); 1 MicroG; 1 Stamina; 1 Stealth<br/><br/><b>Stunts</b><br/><br/>    * MG Brawling (+2 penetration to Brawling attacks &amp; +1 to Brawling rolls in defense)<br/>    * MG EVA<br/>    * MG Slug Throwers<br/><br/>4 Health<br/>4 Composure<br/>3 Wealth<br/><br/><b>History</b><br/><br/>    * Tylos Fell grew up in the war-torn Cuscatl\xe1n province of Moraz\xe1n, one of the members of the Veblen Compact on Az\xe9, the only inhabited planet in the Clarke system. Tylos was a child soldier in the Salt\xe1-Moraz\xe1n War, a resource conflict propagated mostly by outsiders from either the Wells or Haldeman system over the resource Boralene. On a world rich with resources, Tylos and his Cuscatl\xe1n brothers knew only want and violence, alternately and in good supply. For them it was about territory and pride; they were only too happy to accept the far superior weapons and training given them by "advisors" from Wells. As a youth Tylos proved himself again and again as a forward observer during war and during the rare times of ceasefire, as a scavenger for needed material in preparation for the next conflict.<br/><br/>    * In spite of worrying "rough edges" Tylos was marked for officer training by Dreiser leadership within the Compact. He advanced quickly and led a series of successful campaigns for his home region almost always against superior forces. One improbable victory came after another, often at great cost, but always effective. These won victories and territorial advance proved profitable for the off-world factors from Dreiser, the wealth siphoned out of Moraz\xe1n again and again. Over the years Tylos came to realize this but the next prize of victory was always held in higher regard, and there were bounties for him as well. It left him cynical. He couldn't take his frustrations out on those who fed him with implements of war and there were always weaker prey to distract him from any nagging doubts.<br/><br/>    * Tylos' cynicism ultimately manifested in him leaving the Moraz\xe1n military during a period of chaos. There were rumors of being being ousted for egregious misconduct, but that seems unlikely given his value as a military asset. Tylos became a mercenary and at times even fought for Salta under forces directed by the Albion Combine from Haldeman. Tylos' military victories were scarcer in this period. His mind was still brilliant but he seemed at odds with himself. It was then that he met Adam Starke. Knowing victory depended on drawing the enemy out and forcing them to fight, Tylos ordered the brutal razing of a civilian urban district in his own home territory of Cuscatl\xe1n. Starke disobeyed a direct order given by Tylos to participate in this atrocity. Tylos put a phos-carbine to Starke's head and would have pulled the trigger but something about Starke's passion for his love Thena, told to Tylos at every opportunity beforehand, stayed Tylos' hand. Starke was a puzzle to him and his calculating mind couldn't let such a puzzle go unsolved.<br/><br/>    * Sick of contract work, Tylos took several mercenaries who's capabilities he trusted and started working for himself; less\u2026 traditional work. One such job was "rescuing" Naina Kapoor from her captors with the intent of collecting the ransom money. Whatever his motives, she ultimately convinced him into letting her go free, something his associates did not appreciate. A few of them subsequently double-crossed Tylos on their next job, rendering Tylos a captive himself.<br/><br/>    * Tylos is a prisoner of Home on Gehenna in the Leguin system. He's out of his element and out of a command structure. He keeps his mind busy with plans of escape and seems to be taking some sense of satisfaction in the Starke's coarsening, even as he continues to ask about Thena. He thinks about Naina sometimes, but doesn't talk about her. He's confident he'll be leaving here soon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244983/#Comment_244983" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T19:09:31+00:00" title="December  3, 2009  7:09PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This looks like some dark, nuanced play coming.
