But I am interested in systems that give you quite a lot tools for modelling a character's motivations, passions, etc. The goal is a (I guess) quite simulationist one: Help the players to know the character better and be able to think and act like them.<br/><br/>I am familiar with D&amp;D which obviously has none (or nearly none of this). I've then been introduced to games where characters have a few keys (Lady Blackbird is the one I've run). Apocalypse World gives your characters connections to the world, and obvious preferences built-in to their abilities, but doesn't seem to give you many crutches in terms of modelling the kinds of things I'm thinking of. Although I might be missing things - I don't know the AW rules so well. These games seem to be focused on giving you just enough about a character to tell a story with them - narrativist, if you like.<br/><br/>If there aren't games like this, I guess please explain to me why not? As in, why this is a terrible idea and no one does it?<br/><br/>Sorry, I don't think I've been very clear, although I've reworked this several times. Ask me questions and I'll see if I can explain better.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419709/#Comment_419709" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-07T10:41:33+00:00" title="August  7, 2013 10:41AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Smallville, Smallville, Smallville, Smallville.

Just off the top of my head:<br/><br/>Burning Wheel has mechanics around a character's Beliefs. (I don't know much about the system, but I hear that noted frequently as a thing people dig about it.)<br/><br/>Don't Rest Your Head requires you to start your character by saying what they were doing right before the game started, and where they are headed down the line. It's very much framed as a mechanism for outlining both the player's and character's goals.<br/><br/>Wicked Heroes basically only has one kind of numerical stat for each character, representing your motivations (which players define however they want, from "protect my helpless old Aunt May" to "gather as much power as possible"). The greater your score is for a given motivation, the more likely you are to succeed in a conflict that engages that motivation. <br/><br/>Apocalypse World is actually one of my favorite approaches, but maybe I misunderstand what it is you're actually looking for. Yeah, AW has a mechanical representation for your connection to other PCs in "Hx" (History), but the main system for establishing character relationships, motivations, beliefs, and interdependencies is in the rules for the first session. Basically, the GM (a.k.a. the "MC") starts by asking players leading questions, like saying to the healer-type character, "Where do you get your supplies?" or "Who do you refuse your services to, and why?" This encourages players to improvise answers on the spot based on the kind of character they imagine themselves playing, and becomes fodder for the story that will follow. I've been thinking a lot lately, in fact, about how I want to just port this aspect of the game over to other games that don't give as good a sense in the first session of what PCs are supposed to be doing with their lives.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419731/#Comment_419731" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-07T12:45:05+00:00" title="August  7, 2013 12:45PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Rustbelt is all over this.

I'll second Burning Wheel, which gives mechanical weight (and drives advancement via...) Beliefs, Instincts, and Traits (BITs). I'll also add two older games: The Riddle of Steel, Pendragon. I don't know a ton about them, so I won't try to describe how they work.<br/><br/>Here's two newer games: Misspent Youth is a dsytopian future game where you play disaffected youths fighting The Man. You're defined almost entirely by a handful of traits that are more or less personality descriptors. You use them to avoid failure by "selling out" the trait. Doing that turns the youthful trait into its more cynical grown-up version. For example, "cool" becomes "trendy." Ouch.<br/><br/>Annalise is a moody game where you play people who are being stalked by something terrible (by default, a Vampire). You have a Secret and a Vulnerability, which are freeform traits you write (e.g., Vulnerability: my mother still controls my life). Throughout play, you expand those two traits with related subtraits, also freeform (e.g., you might expand the former Vulnerability with a subtrait, "passive-aggressive"). You use them mostly to buy Achievements and Consequences in the multisided stakes game that is conflict resolution.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419743/#Comment_419743" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-07T14:01:54+00:00" title="August  7, 2013  2:01PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fate and derived could be really great for what you're looking for... if they came with a list of Aspects fit for the setting to fuel your imagination... and if some of these Aspects described your relationship with PCs and NPCs... and if you could get most of them trough the use of some provocative questions like the ones used in DRYH and Dogs in the Vineyard.

I don't have the book, though. But this is how I understand it from the way my GM set it up for us.<br/><br/>We were given a chance to choose from a list of character types that might show up in our game (or make up our own). Our game was based on the "Over the Edge" setting. So while I chose the "Clueless German Tourist", the other initial players chose the drug-addicted ER doctor and the drug-dealer. When we added a new player, she imported her energy vampire rock star. That's color. Surface stuff. <br/><br/>Then we were asked to choose the most basic drive for our character. Something that could be put into one word. My character's drive was "Security". The drug-dealer's was "Acceptance". When in doubt, that was what we were supposed to turn to to decide our character's actions.<br/><br/>After that, we were asked to define our character's emotional poles. My character's poles were "Submissive vs Assertive". Her instinct is to be submissive, but she's trying to become an assertive person, so it's a constant push and pull between those two poles. The drug dealer's poles were something like "Brutality vs Mercy". He was driven to be a kingpin of this island community. He wanted to be seen as top dog and would punish transgressions with blood. But he also wanted to be seen as the benevolent king. So his push and pull was between those two images of himself.<br/><br/>Next we defined our relationships with each PC in the form of, "This is what my character wants from them. This is why my character can't get it." My German tourist wanted the drug-dealer to "thrill her" (in the sense of danger and excitement), but couldn't get it because in his eyes, that would taint his "virtuous anchor". For his part, he wanted her to bring out his artistic side, but he couldn't get that because she'd get bored of him. So there's a push and pull between each character as well as internally now.<br/><br/>Then there's a loose sort of stats. My character is "Strong" at sneakiness and knowledge. (I think those are the stats.) Moderate at a few other things and poor at a few others.<br/><br/>Finally, at the end, we were asked to define the character's story arc. As an example, mine was, "This is the story of a woman who is running away from herself."<br/><br/>Our game's first season was pure insanity. Whenever we might have gone a sort of middle or safe road, the GM nudged us to remember our characters' push and pull qualities or their basic need. But mostly, we rarely needed the reminders. We were pretty fueled to drive our characters nearly as hard as you drive a Fiasco character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419757/#Comment_419757" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-07T18:22:30+00:00" title="August  7, 2013  6:22PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For this, I really think there are loads of great approaches. Two that immediately come to mind are Tenra Bansho Zero and Monsterhearts. <br/><br/>TBZ is a great game that I don't consider myself quite qualified to explain having only played one game of it but it manages to make pregen characters come to life in a dramatic fashion that kind of blew me away. You get points from the audience that later can be turned into bonus dice for doing awesome amazing stunts and being a badass at whatever your character is into. But you get a better chance of those points becoming more bonus dice the higher your fates are. <br/><br/>MH blew my mind from the word go. The game really teaches you, via certain procedures such as "strings" that you have over your classmates and that they have over you and provocative and loaded questions about your fellow teens that hit the drama button hard and fast and it doesn't seem to let up. Just be faithful to the letter and spirit of the instructions and it won't let you down.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419758/#Comment_419758" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-07T19:37:09+00:00" title="August  7, 2013  7:37PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hero's Banner would be worth a look.

Although, broadly speaking, I'd say that most games that focus on "who your character is" are going to be either Sim or Narr, but the space between those two is pretty wide. <br/><br/>Basically, you have to ask yourself, are you looking for a game that's about defining the character and then celebrating who that character is, or exploring the tropes of the genre that the character is a part of? That's Sim.<br/><br/>If, OTOH, you want the game to force the character to <i>question</i> the status quo of his or her identity, that's Narr.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419777/#Comment_419777" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-08T05:42:00+00:00" title="August  8, 2013  5:42AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First of all, thank you for the flood of suggestions.

However, what I was specifically looking for here is where you start off with quite a lot defined already. Hence my saying AW didn't suit what I was looking for. (Although I guess you could call that first session character gen and then all my definitions get blurry.) Of the suggested games (which I may check out anyway) Don't Rest Your Head also seems to come under this heading.<br/><br/>From what I have heard, Burning Wheel does seem to be a good fit for my needs - an extensive, thought-provoking character gen system coupled with the ability for BITs to evolve through play. However, I can't get hold of a copy. (* Goes and checks * Ooh, they're in stock again! Now just to see if I can justify the cost of shipping it the UK...)<br/><br/>With threads like these, it's hard to know what to go for, as most people suggest new things rather than seconding previous posters. It would be helpful if people could chip in for the ones they think are best. But perhaps I haven't defined what I'm looking for enough for people to narrow the pool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419780/#Comment_419780" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-08T06:09:41+00:00" title="August  8, 2013  6:09AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Grey Ranks does this, too.

That sounds interesting. Like some the others though, it's not quite what I'm after, so I'll have a go at clarifying:<br/><br/>I'm really looking for systems that give a bit more detail. For some purposes, a single "most important thing" might make for a really interesting game. Detail isn't always what you want. But in this thread, I was wondering about systems that define more detail. You know, maybe 6 passions, and 4 fears, and so on. And I'm looking for systems that do this in a structured way, not just "think about these things", but systems that help players by giving options, suggestions, and a framework for fitting it together. I don't mind whether or not the system uses numbers.<br/><br/>So <i>Annalise</i>, say, sounds really interesting, but a bit more lightweight than what I am looking for.<br/><br/>(Obviously, rules weight in and of itself is not a good. I'm looking instead for high character clarity and detail. You might think that some of the more lightweight systems achieve this economically, in which case feel free to argue that point).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419786/#Comment_419786" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-08T07:37:16+00:00" title="August  8, 2013  7:37AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steampunk Crescendo does this.<br/>Also, FATE can do this, but it may not be what you are looking for. In FATE, you have to make an aspect for your character. So, it works great to help players remember their original concept, or it can help them brainstorm a concept, but if they don't have a solid concept in the first place, FATE can break down in terms of this requirement.<br/>Dogs in the Vineyard is similar to this where if you have a good concept, ditv drives that concept home. It is not very good at helping players discover that concept though.<br/>I have not played it, but Pendragon seems like it is ideally suited for this purpose. I have heard similar things about Smallville. Primetime Adventures does this in a very "light" fashion. In essence your character is the issue they are dealing with and 3 connections or edges.<br/>Hope that helps!<br/>Dave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419787/#Comment_419787" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-08T07:48:23+00:00" title="August  8, 2013  7:48AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, OK, Pendragon's passions might work then?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cucumberkappa" title="cucumberkappa"><img alt="cucumberkappa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/116/nSJOZL6HNH7NS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cucumberkappa">cucumberkappa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419819/#Comment_419819" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-08T19:47:38+00:00" title="August  8, 2013  7:47PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>In standard DramaSystem it's the other PC's player who says why you can't have it, e.g. "I want acknowledgement from my father."

For instance, "I want Carlo to thrill me and show me a world like the movies." "I don't want to give you that taste of my world because it would corrupt you, who I see as my virtuous anchor." That's a bit of a mouthful/largeish text block, so we just sort of shortened it to, "I want Carlo to thrill me, but if he does, he'll lose his virtuous anchor." <br/><br/><br/>On the subject of, "Me toos." - I haven't actually <i>played</i> Smallville yet, but I did do a character generation session with the group who were going to play. I'd say that you would know a good deal about your character and what makes them tick by the end of it - both good and bad. We went into the session with little or nothing, depending on the player, and came out with very tangled relationships and enough plot for an entire "first season".

Cyberpunk has more narrative-style description, while BW's narrative is more implied (by the names of the lifepaths and skills you're writing down).  In both cases, though, it's up to the player to put the "<i>why</i> the character did this" on top.<br/><br/>I seem to remember some old game with really excellent derivative attribute and skill trees, where it was really obvious where your character's ability to do stuff came from.  This included social stuff that tied them into the setting.  Can't... remember...  Maybe Stormbringer?  Warhammer FRP?  Is this ringing a bell for anyone?<br/><br/>There's another technique for figuring out who your character is, which consists of establishing a fairly specific "what's going on right now with the relevant people in this story" and then picking one of them.  A broader example is <b>Vampire</b>, where if you play a Clan Ventrue vampire, you know you're part of a group that thinks X and pursues Y and has opinions A, B, and C about the three other factions in play.  A narrower example is <b>Montsegur 1244</b>, where the game comes with 12 pre-made character and you pick one to customize and make your own.<br/><br/>Oh!  And I should also mention <b>FateStorm</b>.  (I reviewed the first game that uses this system <a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/15/15571.phtml" rel="nofollow">here</a>.)  This game defines characters by elemental affinities, tarot-style universal character archetypes, zodiac signs, and various mental, emotional, spiritual and physical stats.  I don't know if that kind of stuff helps you get into a character's skin, but it helps me.<br/><br/>I can't tell if I'm answering your request, so let me share my experience in case that helps:<br/><br/>- The most "get in character" experiences I've had have simply been with the characters I played the longest.  No detailed char-gen for a quick one-shot game has ever replaced dozens of sessions with my D&amp;D fighter.<br/><br/>- My most "get in character" experiences in short games have been with <b>Primetime Adventures</b>.  The characters I made were not varied and multi-faceted.  They were defined only by the issue that was going to be addressed in play.  So, whenever they were on screen, I felt very prepared for the action.
