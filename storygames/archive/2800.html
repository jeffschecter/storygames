That's the setup of the situation that keeps the main characters bouncing off each other. It's the reason why people don't just walk away when things get rough, why they escalate their conflicts instead of just taking a few days off.<br/><br/>Many horror movies have a clear crucible: the group needs to stick together to survive, even as their personalities clash. (I much prefer movies where the threat is a crucible to one where it's the main attraction; hence my love for Pitch Black.)<br/><br/>I just read an AP report on the Forge about the typical group of PCs: they have no real reason to stick together, but the players "don't want to be dicks," so they make the characters stick together.<br/><br/>Now, when I talk about the crucible, I'm not necessarily talking about something that keeps them all on the same side. They could be on opposite sides, but have to deal with each other a lot of the time, their stories becoming unavoidably interwoven.<br/><br/>So my questions to all of you thus are: What are well-structured crucibles, either given by the game or made up by the players? Do you address this explicitly in your games? Have you developed guidelines for making this happen? Are there crucible-creating techniques we could apply to any old game?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RoninZombie" title="RoninZombie"><img alt="RoninZombie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RoninZombie">RoninZombie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63576/#Comment_63576" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-11T21:36:59+00:00" title="April 11, 2007  9:36PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a good way to establish a strong "crucible" is to present the players with a specific party concept.

I remember a game I was running a while back where one of the major early scenes of the game was when the Queen (who had hired the party) was murdered.  I expected this would evoke some real emotion from the players, then I forgot to inform the players that they were supposed to like the Queen so I got a party of two people actively plotting to kill the Queen, one total mercenary and one of the Queen's nephews who she had kept from site because he has no social skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that giving the players a crucible of loyalty to the Queen would have let each player play the type of character they wanted and let me tell the story I wanted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63582/#Comment_63582" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-12T00:31:21+00:00" title="April 12, 2007 12:31AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I am experimenting with crucibles.</p>\n<p>In one Snow From Korea, the characters are literally contained by a mansion; they cannot leave its walls.

You can't move out of the community's eyes without provoking some response. Everything you do affects and repositions your relationships.

The characters, while they may not trust each other, while they may have totally conflicting hidden agendas that bring them into conflict, are drawn together by having to do the dirty and unrecognised job of hunting down monsters, twisted technology and dealing with the consequences of this. The unity of this shared, unpleasant experience is what brings the party together. And then they fracture into pieces as hidden agendas come to the surface. <br/><br/>There are no particular guidelines in the game for this: it's an accepted part of the fiction that the characters are all working for the RPA.

"Okay, why are you all refugees?"  All of a sudden, from the moment they conceive their characters, the players are working from a premise which puts them a) together and b) under pressure.  "So you're on a reality TV show where people want to shoot you in the head.  Why did you sign up?"  The crucible is inherent in the premise from which we are working, together, to make a game.<br/><br/>For a long-term game, I often don't know what the first crucible is going to be until the players and I create characters together.  I find out, by listening to them talk to me and to each other, what they think is important to their characters.  Then I work to build a situation where walking away means losing out on what's important to them, for whatever reason.  Once the PCs are through the first crucible or two, I find that the crucible just has to create pressure on the group, not both create pressure and create the group at the same time.  Make sense?<br/><br/>For example, in my Rome game - which just finished, and I am still kind of reeling - one PC had originally been a slave, and the concept of freedom was very important to both player and character.  I knew this from day one, and so in creating that first story I put his freedom at risk if he did nothing or walked away.  Guess what?  The PC got deeply involved in the crucible - and with the other PCs.  By the third or fourth story of the game, I could be sure that the character wouldn't walk away from the other PCs even if he was less directly under threat, because he owed them so much and vice versa.  By the end of the (four-year) game, the PCs really didn't like each other much, but they always turned to each other first because hell, no one else knew them so well or had any idea what they'd all been through together.  They became, by the end of the first year of the game, like a family.  And family's a hell of a crucible, as I'm sure we all know .....<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63627/#Comment_63627" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-12T07:54:49+00:00" title="April 12, 2007  7:54AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Crucible-first, crucible-after, and crucible-in-play.

There are basically these variations:<br/><br/>   1. The characters already know each other and are an established, current group of some kind, such as a military, police or Special Forces unit, ship\xe2\u20ac\u2122s crew, group of freelance troubleshooters, group of friends who get together regularly, relatives, co-workers, or people who live in the same small location.<br/>   2. The characters know each other from the past (perhaps having gone to school or been in the military together) but they have been out of touch for some time. They are reunited by an event such as a funeral, a planned reunion, attacks upon others of their number, their old commander calling for help against an enemy\xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/>   3. The characters are strangers to one another, but are in similar or complementary lines of work or belong to the same organization. Someone assembles them as a team to perform a project or mission or to staff something like a ship, fort, house or enterprise, either by approaching them individually or by advertising.<br/>   4. The characters are strangers to one another and meet by chance, while traveling on a ship/train/spaceship etc., in a trade caravan, in an accommodation place, at a pilgrimage site, at a conference or simply in the public square or street. A crisis (accidental or engineered) throws them together.<br/>   5. The characters are strangers to one another but are all victims of the same person, who has shanghaied, captured or imprisoned them.<br/>   6. A combination of two or more of the above (some characters join the group in one way, some in another).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently" title="DirkGently"><img alt="DirkGently" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently">DirkGently</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63733/#Comment_63733" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-12T16:20:43+00:00" title="April 12, 2007  4:20PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Vampire 2nd Edition had some great stuff about this sort of campaign/party setup.
