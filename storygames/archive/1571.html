                    A couple of months ago, I got into a discussion about making an online narrative RPG. So I got down to work and put together a proof of concept game called "The City of Forgotten Gods", set in the world of John Harper's Stranger Things. The setting is a sprawling magical medieval/steampunk city where humans and demons (i.e. everything that's not human) live in uneasy proximity.<br/><br/>The game is 99% ready to go except for one thing. I need adventures. So I thought I'd toss the idea out and see if anybody wants to contribute a peice of their brain to this project.<br/><br/>An adventure in COFG is a short textual hook to spark narration from the player. An adventure is open-ended and evocative. It can also, optionally ask a question, or pose two options (which should also be open-ended). An adventure can lead to another adventure, as can either or both options posed by an adventure. An adventure can also be tied to a specific location.<br/><br/>To make it a little clearer, here's a screenshot showing a simple adventure I conjured up:<br/><a href="http://tony.dowler.com/images/screen2.gif" rel="nofollow">COFG Screenshot</a>.<br/><br/>Here's the "About" text for the game:<br/><br/>In a Strange Land<br/><br/>No one knows who built the City, or when, or why. Or maybe itâ€™s that everyone knows, but their accounts differ. The City is a magical place, a sprawling landscape of broad boulevards and labyrinthine alleys, proud temples and prouder taverns. Masked cults serenade sleeping gods, lecherous spirits stalk the living, and pale demons parlay in moonlit courtyards while all round the restless hum of commerce, love, birth, death, and the business of survival continues day and night.<br/><br/>Humans and Demons<br/><br/>In the City, Humans live in uncomfortable proximity with an awesome variety of other creatures magical, mundane, monstrous, and subtle, collectively known as demons. Demons in the City aren't Devils, and they aren't specifically evil, but their appearance and habits set them apart from humans. Where humans and demons meet, there is always friction. Some humans hunt and kill demons indiscriminately. The opposite is also true.<br/><br/>With a Single Step<br/><br/>In this city, thousands are born, live, die, and are forgotten; but not you. For fate has decreed your journey significant. And so the Librarians of Quaam have dutifully vowed to record it for the generations. You will take the role of a human or demon inhabitant of this City of Forgotten Gods. Fate has apportioned your journey a finite number of steps. At each step you will record your actions and their consequences. When your journey is complete, it will enter the permanent record in the Library, where others may read it.<br/><br/>In the Details<br/><br/>The City of Forgotten Gods is based on an upcoming role-playing game called Stranger Things by <a href="denied:â€http://mightyatom.blogspot.com/â€" rel="nofollow">John Harper</a>. <br/><br/>I think it sould be super-cool if people had some ideas for adventures they'd like to share, either here or by Email. Don't worry too much about the setting or the structure of adventures. I'll do my best to adapt whatever cool stuff to the game. Naturally I'll also acknowledge people's contributions.                </div>

                            (Is "tinggg" in the screenshot a sound effect or a name?)
<ul><li>The goddess Imarha will awaken one day, and she will walk forth from her temple down one hundred twenty-one steps to a path of eucalyptus leaves.  Every day may be that day.  Every day the steps must be scrubbed and fresh leaves put down.  The servants of the temple have their wrists chained on their third birthday:  one wrist to a brush, the other to a pruning hook.  Now a human sculptor has come to the temple with a hammer and chisel and a light in his eyes.<br/><br/>Tell how you keep the chains intact.<br/><br/></li><li>Your half-sister went pale and sick two months ago and never rose from her bed again.  Your father had no coin for the necropolis, so they burned her body and held her urn aloft on the Wailing Tower.  Last night, packing her things to sell, you found a warm maple box:  inside it was the chrysalis of her demon heart, still bright, still beating.<br/><br/>Tell how you regather her ashes.<br/><br/></li><li>The only true books in the City are produced by the androgynous castrati of the Order of Ink, who sit in a spiral and pass by whispers the words they copy, one at a time.  The old devotees at the end of the spiral produce works that are far different from the master copy; theirs are the most beautiful, and the most prized.<br/><br/>Tell how you bring down the Order of Ink.<br/><br/></li><li>The market beggars are gleeful today, babbling and displaying their truncated limbs and missing noses.  There is a demon called Mercy, they say, who offers them gentle anesthesia and gold--gold!--for the chance to borrow a little flesh with her knife.  They are starting a little temple to her, in an empty market stall, stealing incense for her instead of cheap wine.  She will be their waking goddess.<br/><br/>Tell how you come to give up your eye.</li></ul> </div>

                            Woah! Cool! These are awesome! I might have to split them into sub adventures to get the pacing right, but you've got the tone down.<br/><br/>I also wrassled up another screenshot.

                            I thought about just posting some kiped ideas from these, but, I think that Harlan Ellison's [u]Strange Wine[/u] and [u]Deathbird Stories[/u] could keep you in hooks for years with this setting.                        </div>

                            Here are a few of the adventures I added myself. They don't quite have Brendan's flair,  I'm afraid, but they may spark some more ideas. Adventures don't have to be dripping with setting (though it helps), they just have to spark some narration.<br/><br/>"Spare a coin for a poor brother, cast out by kin and kind?" These beggars are the scourge of the city. Yet a beggar is often more than he seems. Who is this beggar?<br/><br/>A voice cries out, "Stop him! Stop the murderer!" You turn to see a skinny demon fleeing towards you, pursued by a mob of humans armed with ropes and torches. Do you stop the demon, or help him escape?<br/><br/>Somewhere, not here, they are plotting to kill you. Who are they, and why are they seeking your life?<br/><br/>A group of night demons approaches you. "Brother, do you not know? None may hunt here, but that they join our pack."', Do you join the pack?<br/>IF YES: The leader leers at you. "Then tonite you will lead the hunt." Where do you lead them?<br/>IF NO: The pack falls silent. "Then you must pay the tax." What is the tax? Do you pay?<br/><br/>A beautiful Amazon in white armor is canvassing the neighborhood with a proclamation. "The city guard is looking for special deputies to patrol the city and watch for illicit demon activity. You look like yo''ll do. What transpires as a result of your answer?<br/><br/>Without warning you are set upon by a crazed figure in tattered rags wielding a bronze scythe. How do you defeat this foe?                        </div>

                            This is a little off topic, but still somewhat a propos. You mentioned Harlan Ellison. My favorite quote of his is "To do is to kill, but to suggest is to create." That's very much my philosophy with this game. I want to leave the best stuff <i>un</i>said so that the player can't help but start filling in the blanks.                        </div>

                            This is fascinating stuff, Tony. Keep us in touch with how it goes.<br/><br/><i>At the edge of town, you see a small boy in a tree. He is covered in soot, from head to toe, and cowers behind a branch. From whom is he hiding?<br/><br/>In the desert, the sands rise around you, forming a serpent. It lashes at you with its fangs, knocking you to the ground. Knowing you cannot hit with a normal weapon, how do you destroy the serpent?<br/><br/>As you walk through the town, you realise you are accompanied by two ghosts, with blood on their hands. No-one can see them but you. Do you treat them as friends or foes?<br/>FRIENDS: Finding a fireplace, the ghosts sit down and tell you the story of how they died. What is their story?<br/>FOE: Before disappearing, the ghosts curse you. In the coming days, you will feel their curses come to reality. What is their curse?</i> </div>
