We had about 12 people on the peak of Saturday, which was pretty much perfect for the space.<br/><br/>In a Wicked Age was the star of the show. We ran and played four chapters before I left at 5pm, and every one of them was a home run:<br/><br/>In chapter 1, a mighty gladiator struggled between his desire to lay down arms, and his demon-fed bloodlust, while an eight year old prodigy, possessed by ghosts, was proclaimed prophet.<br/><br/>In chapter 2, a rich but foolish merchant paid the price for meddling with necromancers, prophets, and wizards in the matter of his son's mysterious illness.<br/><br/>In chapter 3, a canny virgin rose from the ashes of her father's empire to become voyeur-priestess in training of the warrior cult.<br/><br/>In chatper 4, a demon-binding monk taught a craven warmaster, a slave-cult leader, a millenium-old demon, and a jaded general the true meaning of "I kick your ass".<br/><br/>Apparently the game went on for quite a while after that because the next morning, the we owe list was filling the page!<br/><br/>Sunday was very quiet and laid back. Joe ran some post-apocalyptic mutant Beast Hunters, and did a demo of Perfect for Johnzo and I.<br/><br/>The lounge was a great success, IMHO. The space seemed a little tight at first, but was actually just right. The only downside was that we were located on the bottom floor past the miniature gaming. We didn't get many role-players wandering in, and I don't think we introduced any newbies to story games. What we did, though, was to make new and stronger connections among the northwest story gaming community.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127314/#Comment_127314" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-18T11:35:17+00:00" title="February 18, 2008 11:35AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 18, 2008 3:48PM by Alan.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chapter 5: The demon-binding monk returns, now travelling with the spirit-fighting Gladiator.

Every time I walked in the room, it felt very cliquish, like everyone already knew everyone else and new people weren't really welcome.  I was a little disappointed, because I really wanted to play In A Wicked Age, but every time I stopped by the same group of people were playing, and the reception I got was more "Ugh, do we have to let a new person join?" than "Hey, let us show you this cool game were excited about."  By the time a game finally started that I could join (at 6:30), I just didn't have time because of a commitment to another game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GeekGirlsRule" title="GeekGirlsRule"><img alt="GeekGirlsRule" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GeekGirlsRule">GeekGirlsRule</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127363/#Comment_127363" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-18T17:22:19+00:00" title="February 18, 2008  5:22PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, we didn't react to you that way at all.

It's true that the space was far away from other RPGs, which provided it with privacy (good) and isolation (bad).  And I too ended up unable to get into any games there because my timing was off (I still played <i>Urchin, kill puppies for satan, Monsters and Other Childish Things</i>, and <i>Puppetland</i>, and ran two games of <i>Cat</i>, so I wasn't exactly deprived of gaming).<br/><br/>Please list your comments and recommendations for a better SG Lounge next year (such as the suggestions for a bit more scheduling).  If you don't want to make them public, you can whisper them to Shosuro Kando (RPG Coordinator) and me (Program Manager), or e-mail them to gumby [AT] tlucretius. net and anemone [AT] tlucretius. net.  <br/><br/>We've already confirmed, in this afternoon's post-convention debrief, that there will be an SG Lounge at ConQuest NW in 2009, it will have multiple smaller tables, and it will be located right near the other RPGs.  I can't give exact details until contracts are signed, but I can confirm that it will be at a different, nicer hotel with better spaces for gaming.  We really want to make the next SG Lounge even better and learn from this year's experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vae_editor" title="vae_editor"><img alt="vae_editor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vae_editor">vae_editor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127522/#Comment_127522" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T06:44:22+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  6:44AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Howdy!<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm the Jordan in question!<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off let me say that I had an ABSOLUTE BLAST this past Saturday.

The result was Mutant Killers.<br/><br/>The game was set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, and the characters were people trained to hunt down mutants. The beautiful part was that they all ended up having crazy mutations themselves, so there was a lot of "those in power decide what is adaptation and what is mutation".<br/><br/>Instead of the first four character creation steps in the book, there was:<br/><br/>Step One: The Apocalypse<br/>Define how your character has been shaped by the harsh landscape of the apocalypse. Talk about the physical landscape, the mutations you've developed, your traumatic childhood, etc.<br/><br/>Step Two: Tribe<br/>Just like in Beast Hunters, except all characters are encouraged to be from different tribes.<br/><br/>Step Three: Your Enemies<br/>Just like in Beast Hunters, except all characters are encouraged to take traits that label other party-members' tribes as enemies.<br/><br/>Step Four: The Caravan<br/>At some point, you got abducted by the big, black, armored van known as the Caravan. You received state-of-the-art mutant killing training. You learned... stuff, I'm sure. At this point, you define what you learned, what you proved, and what gear they kitted you up with.<br/><br/>They all functioned exactly the same, mechanically, as the steps in the book.<br/><br/>And then, instead of beast hunts, you were sent to track and kill dangerous mutants. The one they went up against was named The Mind Eater, and he had an annoying voice.
