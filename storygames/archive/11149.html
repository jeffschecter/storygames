In North America that is. The middle east is fighting a totally different battle than we* are.<br/>There are cities and townships that have been cleansed of zombies, and the survivors have set up permanent residence there.<br/>It turns out that if there is no worthwhile prey within a few miles, a zombie will more or less stay put.<br/>Therefore, if you clear out your township and set up a two-mile wide belt of razed ground, you're pretty much safe.<br/><br/>Except for the fact that looters go into Z-zones, trying to score shit, and get bitten. And then they wander into your township, and a new outbreak occurs.<br/>But if you have city guard who dress in hazmat suits and subject visitors to routine examination to ensure that they don't have any of the QL toxin in their system, then you're safe.<br/><br/>Except for the fact that sometimes birds and rats can become hosts to the QL toxins. They aren't affected, but they can become dangerous carriers. Now, that two-mile wide belt of razed ground, coupled with an electric fence, that outta take care of the rats. And a few bait-and-zap traps set up around town will kill off most of the birds. So, more or less, in a manner of speaking, you're safe.<br/><br/>I mean, mostly. Zombies occasionally wander. QL toxins can occasionally find their way into your town through persistent animals. The early-stages antidote isn't 100% effective. But, for the sake of discussion, you're safe.<br/><br/>And you want to stay safe, which means staying on top of any future developments. Which means some limited reconnaissance. And... the news you're receiving from your field ops is bizarre. The zombies... when they don't have any nearby prey to track, it's not like they just go to sleep, or wander around. <i>They do stuff</i>.<br/><br/><b>THE GAME: What's the stuff that the zombies do? Do they do different things, or are they all working on a communal project? Do they have a leadership structure? Why are they doing those things? What do you presume their next step is? Be creative and weird and interesting. </b><br/><br/>*for the sake of the game, pretend you're from North America if you aren't.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247636/#Comment_247636" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-19T23:08:33+00:00" title="December 19, 2009 11:08PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [1] They're removing all signs of civilization, working as a team (with no apparent leadership), tearing down buildings, ripping out roads, burying waste and cars, planting trees, scattering seeds, etc.  They are motivated by ancient spirits of the earth (who are also animating them), who intend to wipe all signs of mankind from the planet.  Once they have finished healing their little districts, they will move on and reclaim another patch.  But that will take years.<br/><br/>[2] They're recreating ancient Egypt, making Egyptian-style clothing to wear, building pyramids, temples, and sphinxes.  They are led by zombies in the dress of ancient Egyptian priests and nobles.  There are rumors of a zombie Pharaoh.  This is because some zombies have become hosts for the ghosts of ancient Egyptians (only the ghosts of those who were properly mummified can possess zombies), aided by certain ancient Egyptian artifacts in various North American museums.  Once they have finished their projects, they will settle down to a <i>proper</i> afterlife.  <br/><br/>[3] They dance, sing, paint, throw pots and weave tapestries.  Not all zombies are good artists, but they all are making art, either singularly or in small groups.  This is because only the parts of the brain dealing with the artistic impulse and feeding remain active.  They will continue making art until they decay away.<br/><br/>[4] They're all playing WoW.  No behavioral differences can be detected from before, except they no longer need to have bathroom, food or sleep breaks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247637/#Comment_247637" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-19T23:19:42+00:00" title="December 19, 2009 11:19PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They're burrowing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247638/#Comment_247638" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-19T23:26:41+00:00" title="December 19, 2009 11:26PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They're laying out debris in fractal patterns.

So they allow little pockets to survive and thrive, until they've grown fat enough to be utilized again.</blockquote>\nWIN.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mike_the_pirate" title="mike_the_pirate"><img alt="mike_the_pirate" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y4/r_goulet/smalliconmike.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mike_the_pirate">mike_the_pirate</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247956/#Comment_247956" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T22:09:11+00:00" title="December 21, 2009 10:09PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Macarena?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_247998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247998/#Comment_247998" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-21T23:55:03+00:00" title="December 21, 2009 11:55PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mike_the_pirate</cite>The Macarena?</blockquote>\nLOSE.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248031/#Comment_248031" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-22T07:37:56+00:00" title="December 22, 2009  7:37AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you ever noticed how very similar zombies are to viruses? <br/><br/>They are practicing the macro-equivalent of lateral gene transfer between humans and ... something else, deep in the Z-Zones.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248412/#Comment_248412" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-24T04:20:39+00:00" title="December 24, 2009  4:20AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like most races, the zombies began with survival of the fittest. Those not fit for the hive mind were eaten, those who were fit were turned. <br/><br/>At first, the hive mind saw humanity as a threat. The victims it designated as hosts were spawned as shock troops...soldier ants to establish territories...then came the drones...then the breeders....leading to new cycles of hive mind birth.<br/><br/>After the first waves of destruction and chaos against the humans, the zombies started fighting one another...much like the wars between early hominids. As the warriors among the zombies were gradually wiped out in a war of attrition, the drones survived along with the breeders.<br/><br/>Near human settlements, the warriors are still spawned..but far from surviving human enclaves, things are strange. It looks like the zombies are trying to piece together a society, a fake society to use as a bait for recon parties. The hive minds are still trying to work out the meanings behind the artifacts left behind by the humans. Why did they cook all of the nutrients from their food before ingesting it? Why did they cook it at all?<br/><br/>What's with all the glass fronted boxes with chairs pointing towards them? The ones with the pushbuttons things with all the hieroglyphs on them are obviously connected to certain metal boxes for a reason. <br/><br/>And what's with all the blue cabling? It obviously has some kind of religious significance. The humans must have looked into the glass and seen some kind of communion with a hive mind of their own.<br/><br/>The zombies have started ripping up Cat-5 cabling and cut it into lengths to ties into bracelets and necklaces. They are trying to trace the path of the telephone and cable internet networks to a central hive mind...in the hope that they might confront the human hive mind once and for all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248572/#Comment_248572" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-25T23:09:42+00:00" title="December 25, 2009 11:09PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            SOooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo dope.<br/><br/>Thanks for the christmas present, Vulpinoid.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248574/#Comment_248574" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-26T00:02:42+00:00" title="December 26, 2009 12:02AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Have you ever noticed how very similar zombies are to viruses?</blockquote>\n<a href="http://www.mathstat.uottawa.ca/~rsmith/Zombies.pdf" rel="nofollow">People have, yeah.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
