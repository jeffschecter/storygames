I had just returned from our local game day thing where I played in a game of PTA, and we started talking about props in games.  I love the clay poker chips my group used for fan mail in PTA.  Since my first introduction to that game, my group has been using those chips for fate points, hero points, or whatever in the games we play.  There's just something about throwing down something with weight, with heft, on the table.  Back when we were playing using the current Shadowrun rules, the players would forget to spend Edge, SR's hero points, simply because there were so many other numbers on their character sheets.  We added physical counters and Edge went a'flying.<br/><br/>The brother-in-law plays a Savage Worlds game that has a humorous bent.  In that game, the GM gives everyone three Reese's Peanut Butter Cups to use as bennies.  You spend one, you get to eat it.  This, I thought, was totally cool.  Not only is there something physically present that players can use to remember they've got the points, but you add in the hungry gamer factor, and you've got players spending those points.  But then he told me how they do wounds in this combat-heavy game.<br/><br/>Prunes.<br/><br/>Take a wound, put a prune on your sheet.  Heal up, and you've got to eat the prune.  Nobody in the group likes prunes, so it's an incentive to keep the character uninjured.  (Or get your character killed off.)  That, I thought, was neat.  But here's where I really liked the idea -- the prunes stain the character sheet.  Over time, the players will have a real representation of how physically banged around their character has gotten.<br/><br/>I'm thinking of other applications of this.  I can imagine a game like Call of Cthulhu, where as the investigator lost sanity, her sheet would become darker and harder to read.  Perhaps photocopying the sheet with each point gone, so each loss of sanity results in the sheet becoming more difficult to read.  Lose four points of sanity and before the next game session, you copy the character sheet, take that copy and copy it again, take that copy and copy it again...<br/><br/>I'm just rambling here, but yeah.  The deterioration of the character sheet really sounds like a neat thing.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ShaneJackson" title="ShaneJackson"><img alt="ShaneJackson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ShaneJackson">ShaneJackson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61485/#Comment_61485" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-18T23:40:41+00:00" title="March 18, 2007 11:40PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's pretty funny.

The GM punched it and only noticed the trick as he handed it back.  He gave the player a look, took his sheet, and punched it.

When you ran out of room for hole punches, the character couldn't come back to life again.

I was in a long-term Call of Cthulhu campaign where two characters lived through horrors untold.  So did there character sheets.  By the end, they had tons of pencilled (and erased) notes, candle wax, spilled drinks, pizza sauce, and probably other things all over them.  The sheets looked as used and scarred as the characters they represented.<br/><br/>It's also something I've worked into my upcoming game.  As characters are injured, they receive scars, which are traits that have a limited usage.  Once a scar is used up, you draw a line through it, and it just sits there for the rest of the character's life.  Ugly and useless.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63207/#Comment_63207" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-07T14:20:40+00:00" title="April  7, 2007  2:20PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I STed a 7 year VtM campaign with my gf (who has since become my wife) as one of the players.

The short of it is I'm now working on a game that uses a character sheet that gets destroyed as you play the game.  The character sheet is a classified government memo that describes the character's background.  As you play, you black out sections of the memo.  Eventually you're left with a character sheet that's unreadable.
