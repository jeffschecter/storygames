                    Heya,<br/><br/>A lot of games have pantheons of multiple gods/spiritual beings.  Fantasy RPGs are notorious for this.  Yet, I don't think I've ever played a game where the gods actually <b><i>did</i></b> something!  They're usually just described in a casual way and how they directly affect the common person's life (let alone directly affect the lives of the PCs) is left up to one's imagination.  To me that seems weak.  This is like a whole realm of goodness that seems underdone and underimagined, IMHO.<br/><br/>So here's what I'd like.  How should a pantheon of multiple dieties be done?  How can a game desiner use that trope to have an impact of actual play?  Why and how should the gods be important to the common person and the player-characters?<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                </div>

                            I'd say by actually making the gods really do things. Actually, make it so that the players acting either against or with these gods gets the gods in motion. <br/><br/>I think I like how Burning Wheel does it - you have a trait  like Faith that actually works! Need a miracle - test the Faith trait. Lots of followers helps. Bingo! That's like an instant motivation for the Evil High Priest PC to really go out and get a lot of chanting minions with the final goal being to get the Evil God to act on his behalf.<br/><br/>So the point is to make it worthy while for the players to pay attention to.                        </div>

                            Oh, lordy.<br/><br/>Religion in RPGs has all sorts of problems.  To just get at some of them, most fantasy worlds base their understanding of religion on the discourse about "world religions" that appears in the nineteenth century and assumes that cultured civilizations will have one or more "world religions" in place of Christianity, which fill pretty much the same functions as Christianity and, like Christianity, operate in a sphere separate from everyday society, as in the Anglo tradition of separating church and state and having a secular realm/society.  Under this model, for example, Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Daoism, and Shinto are considered "world religions."  China gets three world religions, all of Africa gets zero.  You can see how this is problematic.<br/><br/>The truth is, before modernism, industrialization, and globalization (along with religious policies based on Western assumptions) encouraged a kind of "Christianization" of many foreign religious traditions, the various "religions" of the world looked pretty different than they do now, and that's especially true of religions outside of the Abrahamic monotheistic tradition.  Chinese Buddhism for example, didn't really become a "religion" in the modern sense until the 1910s-1920s, but that didn't mean people didn't believe in it or practice at Buddhist temples for centuries before then.  It was more of a scattering of diverse semi-related practices strongly integrated into local societies and people's everyday lives, instead of a churchlike, clearly separate institution managed by the Buddhist clergy.  Pre-modern "Buddhism" was more closely related to the popular religious traditions, including popular Buddhist religious movements but also including all the other religious and social activities that made up pre-modern Chinese society.  Likewise, the Japanese state reinvented Shinto (a popular, traditional animism) as the state religion partially to fight unruly popular Buddhist sects and the massive economic and political power of Buddhist temples in Japan.<br/><br/>In any case, I don't know that I have an easy answer to your question.  My solution to these types of things is almost always "make it more like it actually is/was in the real world."  Generally speaking, I think the real world handles things in ways that are infinitely more complicated and interesting than most fantasy worlds, because you just couldn't make this shit up.  The real world is so crazy <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  So find a polytheistic tradition that appeals to you and base your religion on the way people actually did things, not point for point, but just to make your fantasy religion as bizarre and awesome as real world religion.                        </div>

                            Heya,<br/><br/>Jonathan, your point is good, but you're looking at things from the perspective of humans towards gods.  I'm talking about the opposite direction.  How do the gods look at the mortals?  I'm talking about having a group of diverse dieties in one location.  They have power.  They have the power to give power to mortals.  How would they do that?  Why would they do that?  How would that donation of power and intervention look to the mortals?  How would it look to the gods?  Do the gods fear the mortals?  What would cause them to personally intervene?  What could stop them?  Most importantly, how could this be represented in a game's mechanics or setting?<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>

                            We started a game months back where we were gods kicked out of Krynn trying to find a new home to lord over.

I have a copy; it's one of my favorite supplements to just read.  Haven't actually played with it though.  <br/><br/>Essentially, gods have a new type of power, called primal.  Primal base is the core of their being, and primal flux is sort of the divine fuel source generated by a god's primal base in a compound interest equation.  (Primal is a quantum function -- no fractions, so you get to take advantage of rounding errors...)  The Reader's Digest version: any primal-powered spell, attack, superpower, what have you, always hits, no roll, and it always penetrates defenses.  The only thing that stops a primal-powered attack is a primal-powered defense.  Gods can also do fun stuff like "lace" a mundane spell or power with one point of primal flux, which gives it all of those funky extras, or use primal to directly create the effect.                        </div>

<p>To expound on Jonathan's comment, consider Shinto or any of a brazillion animist theologies (even some angles on Judaism): every thing has a motivating soul in there. If the river god doesn't like you guys, he doesn't flow. If the tree doesn't like the cut of your jib, she doesn't grow. If the field goddess doesn't think you've been taking proper care, your kids are stillborn. If the sun thinks you're being arrogant, he doesn't shine.</p>
<p>In this world view, there is no "gravity" or "tectonic plates". There are no natural forces except for the whims of the spirits behind phenomena. If the sun gets in a fight with the ocean, you have draughts and floods. If the underworld god needs a new den, you have a volcano.</p>
<p>These gods are needy. They operate nature the way humans would; they need sustenance of all sorts. Humans are small and fit a particular place in the cosmos. In the Sumerian tradition (at least according to the <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/ane/enuma.htm" rel="nofollow">Enuma Elish</a>, they were made to tend the world so the gods could sleep. In <a href="http://www.mythome.org/greekorigins.html" rel="nofollow">the Greek tradition</a>, they're the illegitimate children of titans or made by gods to spite each other.</p>
<p>By the time of the Trojan War (speaking mythologically), the gods are trying to one-up each other by fucking humans to beget heroes. Oracles are bagged regularly by various gods, and the products then fight the products of rival couplings. Those rivalries are obviously human; "Our river wants to fight your river" probably means, "We want to steal your gold, women, and cattle, and charge a toll on everyone coming down your river." But maybe, in this world, those are just the spoils of war, and to war without the intentions of your gods is probably to court disaster. "Hubris" is the Greek word for it.</p>
<p>Gods are local. The gods of my tribe aren't assumed to be the gods of your tribe. Maybe my tribe's patron is the sun and yours is the fields.  If we both worship the sun, which is obviously the same sun, but you call him Grottos and I call her Melzin, then we've discovered something about the sun: she's a cross-dresser! I mean, maybe I think you're <em>wrong</em> about the sun, but that's an excuse to go to war, not a legitimate reason. But if I think you're fucking up the sacrifices, and that's why we had a drought last year, I can bet you we'll be fighting (and it's likely in the form of social posturing) over who gets to do the sacrifices and how. As for the god/ess? Well, sie's probably telling oracles or priests what to do. Maybe she's just fucking with these two tribes. But I'll bet you that her <em>real</em> support determines who wins (you can look at this as "history is written by the victor" if you want, but let's ignore that pragmatic and modern perspective for now).</p>
<p>Look at the phenomena around you and imagine that they're all that way <em>intentionally</em>. That's what the gods do. From wars to shade on a hot day to the fact that boats float: it's all at the whim of the relevant gods.</p>
<p>Were I to write a system that does this, I'd have relationships to gods be my stats. I've got a good relationship with Zeus, but it's really important that my baby be born healthy? Let's hope he and Hera are in good graces. I've got to get to my friend's side and heal his wound? Let's hope I didn't honk off Hermes by murdering that messenger boy. I'm in a new place, and I need to ride on the road? I'd better find out who this road is and how to sacrifice to them; otherwise, their highwayman/priests will be given every right and power to take my goodies.</p>

<b>Neil</b>, I mostly know about the formalization of religion in China, since that's my area.  There's stuff like:<br/><br/>-- Vincent Goossaert, "1898: The Beginning of the End for Chinese Religion?" <i>Journal of Asian Studies</i> 65, no. 2 (2006).<br/>-- Prasenjit Duara, "Knowledge and Power in the Discourse of Modernity: The Campaigns Against Popular Religion in Early Twentieth-Century China,â€  <i>Journal of Asian Studies</i> 50, no. 1 (1991) [skip the theoretical stuff at the front of this one].<br/>-- Rebecca Nedostup, "Religion, Superstition, and Governing Society in Nationalist China" (PhD diss., Columbia University, 2001).<br/><br/>A general analysis of the "world religions" discourse, but one that doesn't tell you much about pre-modern religion, is:<br/><br/>-- Tomoko Masuzawa, <i>The Invention of World Religions</i> (University of Chicago, 2005).<br/><br/>Other than that, I'd just suggest researching specific traditions that interest you.  Joshua provided a nice general overview, but the details are different depending on which geographic or cultural area you're talking about, and even then can vary from community to community (village to village), since pre-modern religion was generally more local and indebted to what was actually happening among a group of people in a given area.<br/><br/>Also, it's important to note that popular forms of religion are alive and well in many parts of the world (including China), but that it's generally not talked about and often repressed by the state or society in general.<br/><br/><b>Troy</b>, I guess I'm not understanding how you can think of the gods separate from the humans that honor them.  Whether you're a theist or not, the characteristics that a spiritual being takes on are directly related to the cultural tradition they are being honored in, like when Chinese sectarian Christians think about Jesus, he is described rather differently than in the West.  How do the gods feel about the people?  Um, how do the people <i>think</i> the gods feel about them?  What do the priests, shamans, fortunetellers, and community leaders say?  If they say the gods are angry, then they're probably angry (since it's the duty of these people to know how the gods are feeling).  How do they know how the gods are feeling?  By reading the signs, whether in the natural world, in dreams, in the voices of the gods that they hear in their heart, etc.  Are you working on something where the gods are PCs or something?  Because, otherwise, I think a human-centered drama is what you want, not a god-centered one.<br/><br/>All of your other questions depend on the cultural context:<br/><br/>Are there things humans can do to upset or harm the gods?  Sure.  They can stop performing the proper rituals.  They can perform the rituals badly.  They can start worshipping new gods or worshiping in a new way.  They can desecrate sacred sites.  They can kill those chosen by the gods.  They can work against the gods' will in any number of ways.<br/><br/>What would cause them to intervene?  The gods intervene all the time.  Every day, every moment, every hour, they are active in the world, at least in the way they communicate and give power to their priests, shamans, community leaders, etc.<br/><br/>How would they give power to mortals?  By guiding them in dreams or visions.  By leading them to new lands.  By making them victorious over their enemies.  By protecting them from danger.  By sending plagues or disasters to harm their enemies.  By making sure they have food.  By sending them a strong leader.  By providing them with sacred objects and places to give them spiritual, political, and economic power.  By allowing humans to heal or curse, to cast charms and magics of all kinds.<br/><br/>Why would they do that?  Because they have a special relationship with a group of people.  Because they want their people to triumph and build great temples and make great signs of the god's work.  Because they want to destroy those who worship other gods, false gods, demons, or worship the right gods in the wrong way.<br/><br/>But all these depend on the culture you're talking about.                        </div>

                            I tend to think a really good way to make polytheism awesome is to make the gods personalities before you make them a list of interests.  Then correlate those personalities with elements of the world which 'express' those traits.  Use those elements not just to indicate the presence of the gods but also to emphasize thematic connections.  If your fire god is a mischievous sort, put fires in scenes relating to mischief-making.<br/><br/>Give the deities interests--things they like, people they like, other deities they like, activities they like, and so on.  Let those different levels interact--sure, Hermes likes messengers, but this boy just pisses him off.  Hermes cast the boy into the ditch and woe betide the poor saps who help him hoping to get Hermes favor...<br/><br/>Don't ask players to choose a god to worship.  They believe in them all and make offering to one or the other in relation to their needs.  That way you get a picture of the whole group.  Make those offerings a negotiation (which brings in the whole deities as personalities with interests and dislikes), which the deity may accept, reject, or clarify.  Make the negotiation itself a feature of a session or several session--talking to the oracles, getting the proper things to appease, etc..  Sure, they can do great things, but they need to be offered great things in turn.                        </div>

                            Heya,<br/><br/>Jonathan, now your answers are definately helping.<br/><br/>Someone mentioned earleir that the gods needed sustinance.  What form might that sustance take?  What is the consiquence of not getting it?  One might be inclined to say death or non-existance, but I don't see how "non-existance" is worse than having to tend mortals who likely under appreciate you and misrepresent your will more often than not.  So what else would motivate a diety to interact with mortals?<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>

                            For my money, religion and its institutions is always more interesting than the gods that the institutions are supposed to worship.  In game, I can be a functioning and dynamic part of a religious institution; I cannot be a functioning and dynamic part of a pantheon of gods.  I don't understand games with big emphases on gods -- I'm interested and entertained by stories of people, and I want the emphasis to be on the people, what they do, and why.  Maybe the 'what they do' are religious rites, maybe the 'why' is some fervent faith -- but the rites and faith of a believer is always more interesting than the arbitrary preferences of a deity.<br/><br/>As an example, Troy, gods don't need sustenance; temples do.  Priests need to be fed.  If the temple doesn't get enough tithes, sacrifices (common practice in the classical world was for the priests to read entrails and cook up the rest of the animal), patronage, and so on, the temple will cease to be a prime motivator of the community and the worship of its god will fade out of view.  My character supporting the local temple so that the city continues to subscribe to beliefs that I care about is way more compelling to "feed the hungry god."                        </div>

                            Troy, you're still thinking from the perspective of the gods, which I think is a less interesting approach.  I totally agree with JBR on this one.  The people are MUCH more interesting.<br/><br/>Gods, in my experience, rarely die or cease to exist.  The real risk for gods is becoming less powerful or significant in the face of new gods or new styles of worship.  If the people start worshiping god X more than god Y (perhaps because god X seems more helpful or dangerous), the cult of god Y is in trouble.<br/><br/>Why would a deity interact with mortals?  Um, generally because the god has some purpose for them, something that the god wants them to accomplish and is leading them towards that destiny.  Or, if it's a hostile god, because he or she hates your guts and wants your people to be wiped from the face of the earth.  Or if it's a trickster or changeable god, because the god gets a kick out of messing with humans.  Or because the god is just a part of the natural world, like the rain, like the seasons.  How can the god NOT interact with humans when humans will encounter the god's workings in the world on a daily basis, as with the rain and the seasons?  And there's things humans can do for gods.  They can dedicate parts of the landscape or buildings or shrines or people or babies or whatever to the god, giving it to the god.  They offer sacrifices or ritual ceremonies to the god.  Sometimes humans copulate with the gods, which presumably the gods enjoy.  Sometimes humans provide the gods with children.                        </div>

                            I'll be really helpful and note that Heroquest, or Glorantha specifically, already does a lot of this stuff. The emphasis is on the humans towards the gods, certainly, but there are times where things flow the opposite way (God learners, Orlanth is Dead, etc.) <br/><br/>Pretty much Heroquest is one answer to this exact question, and is probably worth looking over with this in mind. <br/><br/>Other than that, I generally find myself in agreement with Jonathan and both Joshuas. I could probably debate specifics, but they'd be things no one without a degree in this shit could possibly be interested in.<br/><br/>One bit I will throw in about pantheons is that they're both malleable and only local. As Joshua said its a difference between "our gods" and "your gods" -- but with the added layer that "my god" might not be from either of those groups. <br/><br/>Its also worth remembering that sometimes one persons god is anothers demon.  In old Persian mythology the gods were called Asuras, and their "demons" were Devas. In Hinduism this is exactly reversed. So if you want to take that to the level of gods down, perhaps it is a good polytheistic god's duty to harm and punish the enemies of his people? Or at least make life less pleasant for them so that their own people can feel good about being the chosen ones.                        </div>

                            Douglas Rushkoff's comic series <i>Testament</i> is worth a look on this matter.

                            One of the most creative things I've seen in this line is the Chalion series by Lois McMaster Bujold: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Curse-Chalion-Lois-McMaster-Bujold/dp/0380818604/sr=8-8/qid=1170962706/ref=pd_bbs_8/002-5367440-9141608?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">The Curse of Chalion</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Paladin-Souls-Lois-McMaster-Bujold/dp/0380818612/sr=8-4/qid=1170962706/ref=pd_bbs_4/002-5367440-9141608?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">Paladin of Souls</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hallowed-Hunt-Lois-McMaster-Bujold/dp/0060574747/sr=8-6/qid=1170962706/ref=pd_bbs_6/002-5367440-9141608?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">The Hallowed Hunt</a>. <br/><br/>There are five gods, the Father, the Mother, the Son, the Daughter, and the Bastard (who is the son of the Mother and a demon). They each have areas of responsibility as per standard pantheism (respectively: justice, healing, warriors and hunting, maidens and civil order, and oddities/freaks/accidents/things out of place). But they are entirely in a spiritual dimension which is immediately adjacent to, but totally separated from, this one. They can only work in the physical dimension through the free assent of people (and animals) who are willing to be conduits for miracles. These people are known as "saints".<br/><br/>She works it out really well. Most creative bit of fantasy theology I've seen. And the third book also introduces a parallel system of shamanism, with totem animals.                        </div>

                            Well, the conception of polytheism presented in D&amp;D (and its sundry clones, including much post-D&amp;D fantasy fiction) is based on pretty modern conceits of how pagan peoples viewed their gods. (This is one of the things, in particular, that always gets my goat about <i>Forgotten Realms</i>.) If your conception of polytheistic religions is informed primary by gaming materials, well, yeah, something will certainly seem sucky.<br/><br/>I have to agree that Glorantha already awesome-o-fied polytheism in RPGs. (All hail Brand, bearer of the cluestick.) The way the people interact with the gods there more closely resembles how real-world ancient peoples fancied their relationships with the gods than anything else I'm familiar with. The magic systems in <i>HeroQuest</i> actually put these relationships into play. And if you want the gods to become personally involved? Well, you go on a heroquest and walk in the footsteps of the gods yourself.<br/><br/>I also wanted to opine as an owner of <i>The Primal Order</i> that that book actually kind of sucks donkey balls. Perhaps it seemed innovative in the days of <i>AD&amp;D Deities &amp; Demigods</i>. It's on a shortlist of stuff I'm going to give away as white elephant prizes at some point.                        </div>

<p>I am in agreement with Brand and Jonathan here, regarding what makes <em>actual human religion</em> interesting.</p>
<p>Troy, you are starting with a premise, right, "The gods that the polytheists in this hypothetical game worship are real, discrete beings with motivations and characteristics"?</p>
<p>I think this is, at its core, not a very good assumption. Let's awesomeofy it.</p>
<p>Maybe gods are real but they are not <em>discrete.</em> That is, when god-substance takes on the appearance of Jwuutai-of-white-darkess, it is a complex of motivations and characteristics and iconography that are associated with something humans call Jwuutai-of-white-darkness, but it is highly unlikely to be the <em>same</em> complex as any other manifestation of that same name. Also, these items are also part of the sets that make up other god-images, so that perhaps Jwuutai and Ishgii-waiting-beyond-the-gate both sometimes care about the maintenance of some temple where their idols are housed.</p>
<p>You could probably systematise this, although off the top of my head I'm not sure how I'd go about it. It would probably involve, for each divine manifestation, a quick generation procedure that tells you what <em>that particular</em> manifestation is about.</p>
<p>Then, you have a situation where the inconsistency and complexity of human religion evolves naturally out of the inconsistency and complexity of divinity.</p>

                            Jonathan's post got me thinking.<br/><br/>So, in the typical fantasy RPG with polytheistic elements, you pick a deity and worship it, and get some cool features as a result.<br/>But what if you instead aligned yourself with a particular religion?<br/><br/>So you could align yourself with Judaism, and have a promised destiny and could invoke the fire and brimstone miracles of the old testament.<br/>Or you could go with Hinduism (and maybe broken down into different major divisions or distinctions, like Vedic, etc), and its gods and devas can favour you and grant you weapons and aid you in combat.<br/>Or you could go with Classical Greek, and different gods will favour you depending on your actions, and if you go to war Ares will be by your side, and if you pick up a bow Apollo will guide your shot.<br/><br/>And on the metaphysical, less human focused level.... Maybe all of the greek deities exist, and so do the Hindu ones, and so does the Christian God, and so do...<br/>Or maybe, like Shreyas was sort of suggesting, the same spiritual energies manifest themselves differently for followers of different religions.<br/><br/>The general idea is: Instead of choosing deities (directly), you choose the system of belief in which you approach deities.                        </div>

The (awesome) thing about Heroquest is that there are a bazillion different ways people worship, depending on the kind of belief, the specific religion, local customs, ...<br/><br/>So yeah, there are people who devote themselves to only one god to the exclusion to the other gods of their Pantheon (Devotees), but they are pretty much the exceptions and how people think about them varies, like, A Lot. In some regions, this kind of Worship mightbe frowned upon, while in others it's more common. Generally, though, a huge majority of people in a give religion are some sort of lay member, worshipping the pantheon as a whole, most likely with a few minor folk rites (Common Religion/Magic) and worship of/offerings to the minor guardian deities of the village, individual households or Hero Bands.<br/><br/>And that's just for a single of the 3 1/2 types of religion in HQ: Theism. Spiritists or followers of Wizardry will be different again. (For example, Spiritism has no equivalent of "Devotion"-like I-follow-only-a-single-god, IIRC. At least not in general.)<br/><br/>EDIT: Also, I find Devotees pretty neat. I mean, what else do you call it when a character, after growing up in a polytheistic religion, having worshiped and given offerings to the whole pantheon his whole life, decides to turn his back on those gods that nurtured him, to cut his connections to the other deities and rites and say "NO, these are not my gods anymore! From now on, I belong to this one god only and I will walk in his path instead!".<br/><br/>Personally, I call that awesome.                        </div>

Now this!  I like.  This would be a much, much better way to go than the flat, lifeless DnD Pantheon route or the years-and-years of builing up method like Glorantha.  I could see sitting dowin over the course of just a few months and developing five to seven religions (or denominations) for the players to choose from.  Each religion would grant you specific abilities and advantages.  You could even layer another set of abilities based on the place of your birth and the local/religious customs specific to that geographical area.  Nice.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>

                            That still sounds very much like the "world religions" thing.  I mean, religious traditions are not cleanly divided one from another.  Having different, identifiable religions is really a modern, Western invention.  Take the traditions known as Hinduism and Buddhism, or Chinese Buddhism and Daoism and Confucianism (called the "three teachings" because they are clearly interrelated in traditional China), or Japanese Buddhism and Shinto, or Protestantism and Catholicism and Mormonism, or pre-modern Persian/Middle Eastern religion and Islam.  People are uncertain about these divisions today.  Are Mormons a Christian denomination or different enough to be counted as a separate faith?  Is Guanyin, the Goddess of Mercy, really the same as the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara?  What about Hanuman and the Monkey King?  What about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanic_Verses" rel="nofollow">satanic verses</a> in which the Prophet praised pre-Islamic goddesses (later declared to be demons)?  What about the interrelatedness of the three recognized 'Abrahamic traditions' and the debt they owe Zoroastrianism?  What about the Abrahamic demonology originally referring to other Middle Eastern deities (Baal, etc.)? What about 'syncretic' religions like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santeria" rel="nofollow">Santeria</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Lightning" rel="nofollow">Chinese sectarian Christianity</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handsome_Lake" rel="nofollow">Handsome Lake's longhouse religion</a>?<br/><br/>I mean, sure, some simplification might be required to communicate things to players, but, right now, that doesn't sound all that different from what most games already do.  You're just multiclassing religion or doing the 5x5 splat things that White Wolf does.  Knowing that I'm playing a Christian from Fort Worth doesn't necessarily tell you anything about my character's personal faith or my relationship with God.                        </div>

                            This is all very cool and new-direction-y, but I'd put in a good word for another way to do things that mines a different Real World Religion phenomena. Gods are just like people. They're just a different <i>kind</i> of people. There's spirits everywhere and anywhere, and they're sentient, individual creatures. Some are like us, some are very alien and hard to understand, but everything and anything might have a sentient spirit with whom one might have a relationship. Religion, as we tend to think of it - with dogma and ritual and institutions and such - is a phenomenon of a certain kind of social order (settled, "civilized" in the sense of "city-dwelling"). In other kinds of social orders, the "priest" is just some guy who's got a talent for managing relationships with these "invisible people," and there's very little in the way of a formal dogma - what works is what gets passed on.<br/><br/>I tend to think that in a world where this <i>actually works</i>, the impetus for this kind of thing to give way to "religion" is counterbalanced by a centrifugal force of a zillion independent, heterodox practitioners who can provide the same service as the would-be Church with fewer strings attached.                        </div>

                            Troy, what if there were a lot of different mechanical subsystems on how to invoke divine assistance (ie, living according to a set of beliefs, performing blood sacrifice, ritual dance) and these were always available to anybody who wanted to try them -- they just all use different sets of abilities that the characters may or may not have on their character sheets (willpower, ritual, dance, blah-de-blah-blah)?  Additionally, there were "gods" -- in that there are things that people say about the supernatural world, none of which is given any sort of actual authority in the text.  Then characters would be free to pick up any rite or ritual and direct it at any presumed god.  Roll the dice and interpret the results.                        </div>

                            Troy, I'm not sure what you mean.  I was objecting to having to call my character a "Buddhist" from "the Zen branch" or whatever, because I feel like those concepts are not good markers of the complexity of everyday religious practice.  So that kind of systemization of religion I have issues with.<br/><br/>However, consider the way traits work in Dogs.  I pick the trait "God doesn't allow the innocent to be harmed 3d4."  That says something about my character's approach to religion.  But Fallout allows me to change traits, so if I get into a conflict or situation in which my feelings about X change, then they do.  So there's a way for describing complex, changing feelings about religion, while still giving them weight in the system.<br/><br/>Also, following up on Mark's point, it may be valuable to view the gods as equal participants in a religious tradition, as opposed to beings outside of it or the subject of the religion.  Gods have culture and religion themselves.  The angel Gabriel, for example, can be Jewish, Muslim, or Christian, but still nevertheless has a ritual role to fill in religious practices, just as priests, lay leaders, and ordinary people do.  Perhaps the angel shows a different face to different people, or perhaps the angel practices an Abrahamic faith unique to the angels, something that humans only understand bits and pieces of.  In any case, the gods are a part of the cultures they are related to, participants in the culture, but also limited by its social rules and traditions.  Gabriel cannot just strike down heretics or take other major actions unless the angel does it in the proper ritual fashion expected by religious believers, the other angels, and the Almighty.  Likewise, if the angel chooses to break with traditions, there are serious consequences for everyone.                        </div>

                            Jonathan, <br/><br/>In HQ most religions are culturally based. If you're born a Heortling you probably identify with the Storm gods in some way or another. However, you may actually be an initiate of some spirit cult, with a smattering of folk charms, and an interest in joining the sex-goddess cult some dude just brought from the east. The only people that really have the "identifiably one god or one pantheon" thing are the highest level initiates and devotees of those gods. Everyone else is much less singular and world religionish. <br/><br/>You could make some assumptions about Heroquest characters based on their religion ("He's a Heorting, when we go to tax him he'll scream "live free or die" and then try to hit us with a lightning bolt") but the degree to which that actually happens in game is determined much more by culture than religion, and is one of the big ways in which players define their own Glorantha. Many folks do play religions in HeroQuest pretty deterministically, but not all of them, and it really is a group choice rather than all that inherent in the material. (At least much of the newer material. Glorantha, like religious doctrine, changes over time.) <br/><br/>The other thing is that much as I do violently disagree with the world religion take on how things work, not all religions have been equally blended at all periods and in all places. Certainly now the religion of China is difficult to apprehend in western "what sect are you" terms -- but there have been plenty of non-Western influenced periods of Chinese history in which one sect or another was persecuted for being enemies of the state, not Chinese, or otherwise difficult in some way. So even the historical Chinese, much as they many times syncratized religions, still could occasionally make value judgments and focus specifically on one group as different than the other.  <br/><br/>Which really isn't all that different than the West. Once you get out form under the shadow of the Catholic church in Western Europe, the mixing and merging of belief the world over becomes a complicated thing. And everywhere and everytime religion is far more based in culture than we're allows for here. If you were an ancient Greek when you were in Athens you worshiped Athena because if you didn't do so, at least publically, you weren't Athenian. That in your spare time you studied Zoroastrian mysticism was your own business. Religion was public, rather than the modern ideals of religion as something that matters only to you. (And should be kept to yourself in polite company.) <br/><br/>Shreyas and Mark, <br/><br/>Now this I find fascinating. When given the option of dealing with gods its like we've gone off in exactly opposite directions. Lets make gods less human and knowable, and lets make them more human and knowable. I think the direction you chose there is going to say a lot about the types of directions decisions and themes you want to address with your game, and both have real potential for the awesome. <br/><br/>Also, in this discussion, I think one of the things we could consider is that very often in many, many religions ancient and modern, the role of gods isn't to be lovingly worshiped. Superstition rather than devotion plays a huge part in many religions, and polythestic ones are no exception. The ancient Brahmins chanting the Vedas before the time of Asoka didn't do so because they loved the gods, they did so because they had to appease the gods and because <i>if men didn't do the proper rituals to keep the gods in line the gods would fuck everything up because they were naughty</i>. <br/><br/>On that note, I offer up the following form my vast file of religious wank bookmarks: <a href="http://chronicle.com/free/v49/i39/39b00701.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://chronicle.com/free/v49/i39/39b00701.htm</a> </div>

                            Heya Josh,
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Troy, what if there were a lot of different mechanical subsystems on how to invoke divine assistance (ie, living according to a set of beliefs, performing blood sacrifice, ritual dance) and these were always available to anybody who wanted to try them -- they just all use different sets of abilities that the characters may or may not have on their character sheets (willpower, ritual, dance, blah-de-blah-blah)? Additionally, there were "gods" -- in that there are things that people say about the supernatural world, none of which is given any sort of actual authority in the text. Then characters would be free to pick up any rite or ritual and direct it at any presumed god. Roll the dice and interpret the results.</blockquote>
For the type of game I'm thinking about, yes that's exactly the kind of thing <b>I'm</b> looking for!  It's got the mechanical nature of things I want (will, dance, ritual, prayer, etc) but the individuality I feel is important to RPG design.  It has structure, yet a lot of personal choice- which is something I want to start emphasizing in my designs.  If I were going to write my style of RPG that included religion, that's the very thing I would do.  You've just solved a very big piece of the puzzle for me.  Thanks, bro! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>

                            Brand, I wasn't trying to imply that people couldn't identify with a single religious tradition or have other people identify you with one.  I was arguing against meta-level categories, not local level ones, necessarily.  Also, clearly I have to read Hero Quest.  Can I get away with reading Mythic Russia instead, because Glorantha really doesn't do much for me?<br/><br/>Also, your response to Stefan is boss, though I worry a bit about having a predetermined list of religions.  I'd rather have a list of religious threads or themes that permeate the various cults and rituals of the land, and have players determine what the local traditions and practices are like.  But maybe that has to do with my approach to setting.                        </div>

                            Jonathan, <br/><br/>I could see either way working. If I were doing a historical game I may go with some predetermined religions, because... well, because they were. If I were making up my own Sorcerer and Sword style world for game, however, I'd totally do themes and threads and then have the players make up their own religions. Hell, that kind of makes me want to play a Sorcerer game in which the PCs are all the charismatic prophets of new religions sweeping the Hyborean world. <br/><br/>As for Mythic Russia, I don't have mine yet, so can't answer as to how much it gets the different religions thing.                        </div>

                            I come into this discussion late, but I ran a seven-session <i>The Shadows of Yesterday</i> campaign for which mythology was intensely important, even though the actual "gods" never showed up at all. Instead, the major NPCs -- and, by the end of the game, at least one of the player-characters -- acted mythologically, taking on aspects of the deities to which they were devoted.<br/><br/>When I started seriously reading Indo-Euporean mythology -- besides the familiar Greek myths, I'd strongly recommend Buck's free translation of the <i>Mahabharata</i> and <i>Ramayana</i> -- I found it was much less about "just-so" stories of why X does Y or about power struggles between ideological principles, and much more about the deep, dark, dreamlike power of the unconscious. It's much less about natural forces and much more about psychological forces, much less about why the rains come and much more about loving and fearing your own father.<br/><br/>So I made my setting's deities personality archetypes that only made sense in interaction with each other, and on which the player-characters could model their own behavior. These are the ones that people had the most fun with:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Key of the Unconquerable Sun<br/>"Light of all the world, enlighten me!"<br/>   All who walk in the light of day adore golden Asorion, the Sun, husband of Mother Earth, High King of Heaven, he who dies each winter at the solstice and returns triumphantly to life. But you have gone beyond this common worship and devoted yourself to his principles of learning, rationality, hierarchy, and law. You are an upstanding member of your community: men heed your words and women listen patiently. You are probably literate and almost certainly male.<br/>   Typical backgrounds include nobleman, military officer, bureaucrat, merchant, guild member, independent farmer (not serf), or magus.<br/>   You gain 1 XP whenever you explain to others your well-reasoned plan for solving a particular problem.<br/>   You gain 2 XP if they actually follow your plan (succeed or fail).<br/>   You gain 5 XP whenever you insist on taking the time to think things through to find the logical solution you're convinced must exist while everyone else is running or fighting for their lives.<br/>   You may buy off this Key by acting in blind panic or passion.<br/><br/>Key of Our Mother Below<br/>"From your dark womb we come, O Mother,  and to it all return."<br/>   All tremble before our Dark Lady of the Earth, SvulkÃ«, bride and mother of Asorion, she who gives the harvest and receives the bodies of the dead. But you have gone beyond and learned the secret teachings that ensure the fertility of fields and marriage beds, whispered from grandmother to newlywed for generations since before the High Kings came. Young men and maidens seek your advice, women in childbirth put their lives in your hands, farmers guiltily try your potions, and even the magi of Asorion give you grudging respect. You are probably not a virgin and you are almost certainly female.<br/>   Typical backgrounds include noblewoman, farmwife, midwife, revered matriarch, feared witch, prostitute, or priestess.<br/>   You gain 1 XP whenever you console the sorrowful that new life will come, or warn the joyful that they too will die.<br/>   You gain 2 XP whenever someone does your bidding without anyone publicly acknowledging your power.<br/>   You gain 5 XP whenever you deliberately sacrifice the life of one member of your community to save another.<br/>   You may buff off this Key by refusing to accept the death or possible death of someone you care about. <br/><br/>Key of the Wounded Moon<br/>"My life is not my own."<br/>   All people know the tragic story of KthonnÃ©, the moon, favorite daughter of Asorion and SvulkÃ«, she who was seduced and violated by the First Wolf, gave birth to the Stag King of the fay, and went mad, hiding her bright face in shame and sorrow. But you were dedicated to her service by your father: perhaps because he was too poor to feed you as a girl; perhaps because he had no dowry to marry you as a maiden; perhaps because you, like the moon, were raped, and your father could not bring himself to cleanse his honor with your blood in the ancient manner. ("Raped" in this culture means sex without your father's consent; yours is legally immaterial). Now you stand apart from men and women both, empowered to heal the righteous and slay the wicked, yet never truly free.<br/>   Typical backgrounds include Sword Virgin (woman warrior-healer) or Dagger Bride (spy and traitor-hunter; always a raped woman with no honor left to lose).<br/>   Gain 1 XP every time you deny yourself something in deference to a male authority figure, such as a Magus, nobleman, or other devotee of Asorion.<br/>   Gain 2 XP every time you endure danger or suffering on behalf of another, with no benefit to yourself.<br/>   Gain 5 XP every time you do something to benefit others that would horrify them if they knew.<br/>   You may buy off this Key if you do something you really want to do, just for yourself.<br/><br/>Key of the Worldshaker<br/>"I die triumphant  if my fear dies first!"<br/>   In these troubled times, everyone offers sacrifices to appease Gauros Worldshaker, the brooding god who brings storms, eclipses, earthquakes, and war, the cosmic rebel who alone dared defy his father Asorion when the Sun-King's tyranny would have burned up the world. But you have embraced turmoil as a way of life and made the road your home. Respectable folk step out of your way, maidens and young men watch in wary fascination, small boys follow you hoping to see a fight. You have probably taken a life and are most likely male.<br/>   Typical backgrounds include soldier or sailor (but not officer), brigand, mercenary, gambler, and wanderer.<br/>   Gain 1 XP whenever you ignore good advice, credible threats, or legitimate orders.<br/>   Gain 2 XP whenever you help someone out in such a way that you receive only resentment or suspicion in return.<br/>   Gain 5 XP when you switch sides in a conflict out of pride or principle, without any material gain to yourself.<br/>   You may buy off this Key by pleading for help, <br/><br/>Key of the First Wolf<br/>"[howling]"<br/>   Everyone knows the First Wolf raped the Moon and sired the Stag King of the Fay. No one worships his totem except the outland barbarians and inbred hillfolk -- and you. You know the truth: that all kingdoms fall, all knowledge fades, and even gods come and go, but the ancient powers endure. If other people knew what you worshipped, they would probably kill you for being a werewolf and a traitor: Are you?<br/>   Typical backgrounds include backwoods primitive, bandit, deserter from the army, and secret agent for the Horde.<br/>   Gain 1 XP every time you fail to conceal your contempt for "civilized" folk.<br/>   Gain 2 XP every time you prevail when civilized folk cannot because of your strength, savagery, or cunning.<br/>   Gain 5 XP every time you lead others to reject civilized values and embrace the way of the Wolf.<br/>   You may buy off this Key by saving someone from the consequences of their own weakness.<br/><br/>Key of Old Man Chaos<br/>"Omnipotent is he, and blind, and mad."<br/>   Everyone knows Old Man Chaos created everything that is. Everyone knows he did it by accident and will one day destroy the universe just as blindly. Nobody actually worships him: That would beâ€¦crazy.<br/>   Typical backgrounds include deviant, cultist, or sorcerer.<br/>   Gain 1 XP when you embrace what others find repugnant.<br/>   Gain 2 XP when you achieve personal advantage amidst chaos and ruin.<br/>   Gain 5 XP when you risk your life or sanity, or that of another, for unnatural power.<br/>   You may buy off this Key by recoiling in horror from what you have done.                        </div>

                            And here's an excerpt from the ten page mythology I wrote up for my players halfway through the game:<br/><br/>....<br/>	In the first years of the sun, innumerable gods swarmed upon the earth like flies. They were born of SvulkÃ« in the dark, before she could see that she was beautiful, or whether those that lay with her were foul or fair. In that first long day of Asorion, they had shunned the strange new light and hidden in their mother's skirts; but at his death they had ventured forth again, and though he was reborn, they learned to hide by day and hunt at night.<br/>	Therefore Asorion summoned all the gods before him. With his right hand he held the golden ring of SvulkÃ«, his mother, wife, and queen, and with his left hand he laid his mace across his lap. By his right foot sat his son Gauros, brooding and thunderous, and by his left foot sat his daughter KthonnÃ©, bright and whole, for in those days the Moon was always full, and shone ever in the daytime sky beside her father.<br/>	"Upon my people you have preyed," Asorion told the gods, "and my laws broken. Cattle and children do you steal, and you usurp my share of the sacrifices. When a man ventures from his village, you set upon him in the woods; and when a woman wanders from the path, you take her honor by force. For love of your mother, my bride, I have stayed my hand, but no longer. Willingly must you obey my laws, or else all unwilling you must face my justice."<br/>	Then the Dragon, who was the most subtle of all the gods of old, spoke thus: "O Asorion, equally might thou submit to us, young brother, for we were born of thy mother SvulkÃ« long before thee, and are thy elders. Therefore neither we nor thou should speak of precedence, but refrain from hindering one another."<br/>	"Presumptuous serpent," Asorion replied, holding aloft the ring, "thy half-brother may I be, but thy mother is my bride. To me has she given herself entirely, and all that is hers, is mine. Thy lawful father am I, and therefore thy king."<br/>.....                        </div>

<p>Oh yeah! I am sure that we were deliberately counterpointing one another, or something. I think we were just trying to say, as Jonathan also did, the way to make gods awesome is to look at them as specific and motivated and complex beings, rather than, um, worship-miracle conversion machines.</p>

<cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite> I think we were just trying to say, as Jonathan also did, the way to make gods awesome is to look at them as specific and motivated and complex beings, rather than, um, worship-miracle conversion machines.<br/><br/>Yes! They're not mechanical, they're psychological -- as alien and as familiar as your own repressed dread and desire.                        </div>

                            The original post asked: 
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Troy_Costisick</cite>So here's what I'd like.  How should a pantheon of multiple dieties be done?  How can a game desiner use that trope to have an impact of actual play?  Why and how should the gods be important to the common person and the player-characters?<br/></blockquote>
Well, lets assume you want to put powerful gods in your game that are <blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>specific and motivated and complex beings, rather than, um, worship-miracle conversion machines.</blockquote>
In that case I think you have no choice but to make the game about the gods and the characters relationships with the gods. I think they'll break your system if they are just colour.<br/><br/>I can think of two ways that already exist in the literature. <br/><br/>1) Gods as Superheroes. What would it be like to live as a normal in a world with uber-powerful superheroes i.e. gods ? Games such as With Great Power and Capes could provide a rich seam of godly motivations and behaviours. Nobilis is a game in the same vein which casts the characters as gods of a sort. Two prominent ideas in Nobilis are that the gods are too busy politicking among themselves and working to prevent the Bad Guys (excrucians) from destroying creation to interfere too much with the world and that the godlike pc's can only bind mortals with whom they have a strong personal relationship, love or hate.  <br/><br/>2) My Life With Master. How to serve your gods and preserve your free-will ? I think the mechanics of MLWM are perfect for representing the struggle inherent in serving a divine being. Instead of ending with the death of the god (but then again, why not !) the divine attention could be diverted elsewhere and the PCs can get on with their lives. You could run a campaign stretching over generations. Even better if you serve a loving god rather than a hideous monster.<br/><br/>As a final point, for the situation described in the original post I don't think it's worth getting too hung up on modelling how religion works/has worked in the real world. In our imaginary world the gods are real and do stuff, in the real world the gods are imaginary and do nothing. This would change the whole basis of religion. It wouldn't be about taking things on faith. Thor wouldn't care if you believe in him he's still going to smite you if you piss him off.<br/><br/>Colin                        </div>

                            Colin raises an interesting point, inadvertantly (not that his other point was uninteresting, but anyway).<br/><br/>Why do the gods/spirits in roleplaying act so differently than the gods/spirits in the real world?  I would say something like "Why is there always actual proof of the gods' existence and efficacy in roleplaying?" but that assumes that we all share the same sensibilites about what does or does not prove the existence of the supernatural.  I think this is related to magic and other supernatural entities in roleplaying as well.<br/><br/>For example, say I encounter what I believe to be the workings of a god, spirit, ghost, demon, shaman, etc. in real life.  It's really freaky!  Or maybe awe-inspiring!  In any case, it tends to be a very subjective experience unless you're talking about a communal ritual or something where everyone can feel the presence of the supernatural.  But it's not like the gods are likely to come hand me a magical sword or something.  I might believe that the gods have led me to find or create a sword that is magical, but that's different.<br/><br/>Even in a lot of mythology about demigods and heroes, those who have special relationships with the gods, divinities aren't always directly there, talking face to face with people.  Take Odysseus and Athena in the Odyssey.  As far as I remember, Athena appears once to Odysseus, at the end of his voyages, and even then she's disguised as an old woman.  Odysseus basically encounters an old woman who he believes to be a goddess!  That's not the kind of direct proof most roleplaying games suggest is common.  So what's up with that?                        </div>

                            Jonathan, I think some (but by no means all) folks play with an explicit supernatural world <em>because</em> the real world doesn't supply that.  Just like magic and swordfights, walking and talking gods are an element that fantasy provides an opportunity to experience.                        </div>

<p>Hey, guys, you're coming back around to what I said up above.</p>
<p>Give the gods motivations. They're people. They're the spirits that live inside things and make them be what they are, make them do what they do. Put those things on your relatioship maps and give them voices, if indirect ones.</p>
<p>Anyone here ever heard of a game called Sorcerer? Maybe? It's about a very plausible relationship between people and the sentient things that make them powerful. Sometimes the gods need the people, sometimes the people need the gods, and they're willing to really fuck each other over to get what they need out of each other.</p>
<p>A god needs love from a follower. He's willing to hurt that follower really badly to get that love. That's a story waiting to be told.</p>
<p>I don't love Sorcerer's system on the whole, but I love the way relationships with your own power get personified. The actual sorcery stuff is great.</p>

                            And see, that's probably the part of Sorcerer that engages me the <em>least</em>.  It takes something powerful because it is numinous and otherworldly and turns it into something immediate and knowable.  The power of the supernatural -- TO ME -- is that it is able to unify people in modes of thought and behavior.  Making it this totally personal thing, couched in very immediate and personal questions, loses the focus that I care the most about.  It works great for other folks, certainly!  But my interest in the supernatural as a game/story element is in how it affects the world at large, not how it screws with one character's life.                        </div>

                            For game stuff, I was going to mention HeroQuest too. Also my own Questers of the Middle Realms, for the potential to build up precarious Favour networks. And maybe John Wick's Enemy Gods, though I don't really know anything about it.<br/><br/>BTW, I think there are several different discussions going on in this thread - eg the stuff about real world religions, while fascinating, doesn't seem to relate to the original post.                        </div>

<p>Yeah, Josh, the cosmic scale stuff is certainly interesting. I just think that stories about people are more compelling; I mean, the interesting thing about the gods in the Iliad and Odyssey is that they fuck with the characters. They're a force of chaos in the lives of the humans because they keep giving gifts to people. I think that's interesting.</p>

                            Warning, long post follows. No, even longer than I normally post.<br/>
<br/>
I've given a lot of thought to subjects that surround this one. Not the polytheism concept directly, but a more basic epistemological question. And I've come to a couple of conclusions.<br/>
<br/>
I think that the central problem of faith in RPGs has been identified here, but only indirectly. Both of the general solutions, to make the subject of the faith personable, or to make it more mysterious are an attempt to get the subjects to be more like they are for somebody in the real world. How are they not like this in the game world?<br/>
<br/>
Well, it's interesting, because in every case I can think of, the notions of how these things exist in the game world are really not disjointed from any way in which these beings are known in the real world by at least some group. Even in the stock game world of Greyhawk for D&amp;D, it's not impossible to rationalize how the Gods are set up as being a real case where faith is in action.<br/>
<br/>
Again, it comes down to the central epistemological question of doubt. Oh, sure, it seems less likely to we today who have faith based only on a notion of a god who does not seem to provide miracles much any more. We think, "Oh, in D&amp;D, the characters have objective proof of their god's existences in terms of the powers that they derive from them."<br/>
<br/>
But can any proof be actually truely objective? Descarte says "Cogito Ergo Sum," but even that's debatable. From a more practical POV, if I see a priest causing some miracle of healing, even see him perform it twice a day, does that mean that there is some god that must exist behind it? Can't I think of some other rationale for why he can do what he does? Perhaps it's the "material component" doing something natural? Or maybe it's not a god, but a demon that grants him this power. Or something else.<br/>
<br/>
And what if a god should appear to my character? Is that some proof of it's existence? Not that this really happens much even in D&amp;D, but let's say you have a high level character who travels to his diety's home to speak with him. Does that leave no room for doubt? Must seeing be believing? That can't always be the case, since, as we point out, today most people seem to believe in what they believe sight unseen.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, that's the definition of faith - belief in something despite not having proof of it.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with many RPGs is that, as players, we seem to have objective proof of the existence of the gods. The books tell us what the reality of the world in question entails. There it is in black and white, St. Cuthbert objectively gives X,Y, Z powers to people who worship him.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, D&amp;D and such tends to be "worse" about this, since it presents these things in about as "pawn stance" a manner as you can imagine. Worse, a system like D&amp;D doesn't have room for any such character flaws as doubt. That is, players are allowed to play their character with any motivation they like, and to have them free from any human foible, if they wish. Given any incentive to play tactically, then, why would you assume that your character may have doubt. If your character is a class that's supposed to be a paragon of faith, then why would the question of doubt in one's diety even come up?<br/>
<br/>
But yet questions of faith are the central problem of religion, and the source of most of it's themes.<br/>
<br/>
That's not to say that all religious characters should struggle with their faith. Some will be adamant, and interesting precisely because their faith is never shaken. But for that to be interesting, it has to be potentially possible that their faith might get shaken. In D&amp;D, the only way that's going to happen is if the player decides to "role-play" it out (at which point he's decidedly stepped away from any Gamism that the game might promote).<br/>
<br/>
Which is not to say that it can't or doesn't happen. I've personally played a D&amp;D character who had precisely these problems. To put this another way, let me be very clear. There's absolutely no inherent problem with the settings of any fantasy world in terms of being able to address any question of faith.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it may be that you'd prefer to address questions of faith from a more "real world" POV, where magic is sparse or something. So a magic-rich world may turn you off. But that doesn't make it impossible for everyone to be able to explore these themes.<br/>
<br/>
In fact it seems to me that people have a problem with magical settings precisely because they don't think that anyone in the real world has had such a magical life experience. The argument goes something like, "Well, since real people don't encounter magic much in real life, if they encountered more magic, they'd be forced to believe." But this is a circular argument. If, in fact, people were more used to magic, wouldn't their standard for proof be higher? Wouldn't they be more worried about charlatans? Wouldn't there be more charlatans?<br/>
<br/>
There certainly are from the POV of the characters in these fantasy worlds. No?<br/>
<br/>
Consider. You worship diety X... why ? Obviously you have a belief that this diety is worth worshipping for some reason. It's morally right to do so. There may even be other dieties in a polytheistic religion who you believe are also right to worship, but do not give as much attention to for some reason. But aren't there always enemy dieties, too? If a proponent of such a diety comes to your character and asks him to join, and points out why he worships this diety, the character now has a choice... do I join the new diety, or not? Probably not, but the question remains, why not?<br/>
<br/>
And the answer is because your belief system tells you that it's wrong to do so. That any power you gain from worship of the diety in question is wrong. Perhaps non-existent. Do they perform miracles, too? Well then perhaps they're illusions. Or perhaps the toll for them is too high, or otherwise wrong. Perhaps the magic is real, but comes from some a source that's being misidentified. Certainly this is not a god, but a demon.<br/>
<br/>
Because the character's religion says so.<br/>
<br/>
Does some magic exist that comes from some seemingly neutral source like "essence" or "mana?" Are there "wizards" in the setting? Well do you think that religions are going to remain silent on the use of such power? In the real world the Catholic Church in Europe went so far as to say that any magic not a miracle from god was delivered by Satan. And therefor outlawed, with the potential penalty of being burnt at the stake.<br/>
<br/>
All religions are comprehensive philosophies that include, amongst other things, how the world was created. Any "magic" that exists fits inside that world view in some way. Yes, it's possible that a particular religion just thinks that this magic is more or less a natural phenomenon left over from the creation of the world, and no more evil to employ than using water flowing downhill to power a waterwheel. But that's then a considered part of the faith, and an important statement of how the practitioners of that magic are going to be accepted by people who are otherwise part of a particular faith.<br/>

<div class="Message">
                            Continued from last entry...<br/>
<br/>
This is key. All people everywhere have a belief system. Even if it's "there is no magic, I'm just seeing things." Or, "All magic is just natural phenomena that I just don't understand yet." Atheism is a belief. Even, "The truth of these things cannot be known," or Agnosticism, is a belief. Once you consider the questions of how a character percieves the magic around them from the point of view of their faith system, all of the "problems" of faith in RPGs suddenly disappear.<br/>
<br/>
From this POV, characters in a game world are precisely the same as we in the real world. We, too, have belief systems that are subject to potential doubt constantly. Yes, the backdrop in a fantasy world is different than that of the real world - magic may seem to work with more commonality of fecundity than it seems to work with in the real world. But isn't that the definition of fantasy?<br/>
<br/>
The only way to be rid of that is to play in the real world, or some alternate earth. Not really fantasy. Which is fine, but that seems to me to be throwing out the baby because the bathwater is dirty. Pour a new tub, and keep the baby, I say.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, I think that fantasy offers a heightened opportunity to explore faith. I mean the high amount of magic means that "proof" of different belief systems is being thrust into the faces of the characters constantly. Which means all the more chances to bring up questions of faith. "Huh, their magic works... and has conquered ours! Does that mean that it's right, and we've been wrong all along?"<br/>
<br/>
I hope I don't sound like a huckster, bringing in a favored system at this late point, but this is precisely why I play Hero Quest. Not that I play in Dragon Pass, but this is the central theme of the most prevalent Glorantha material. The Lunars have conquered the Heortlings. What do you do? Fight for your "Dead" god Orlanth, who no longer is providing magic? Or join the Lunars?<br/>
<br/>
Can your faith overcome the "proof" of the magic around you?<br/>
<br/>
Setting aside, I actually get this sort of question constantly in play with other worlds than Glorantha, however, just using the HQ system. Why? It's nothing complicated, really, the game simply asks of all characters, "What do you believe in?" as part of the basic character generation. Like I say above, as long as you have this, you have what you need to have religious themes.<br/>
<br/>
Now, does "I worship Thor" in D&amp;D cover this? Well, yes, if the player is willing to do some of extrapolation as to what that all entails. But thee's no mechanical incentive to do so in D&amp;D. Let's say that the player decides that Thor wants him to strike down some worshipper of another diety... does he gain any bonus to do so, then? If the player decides that there's some activity that Thor doesn't like, is there a penalty if he does it? Well the D&amp;D rules say vague things about the god not liking it, and being potentially able to do something about it. Maybe the rules for alignment change might come into play or something. But it's all rather indirect, and, again, on the players and DM to come up with.<br/>
<br/>
In a system like Hero Quest, however, what the system does is show you the character's links to his belief. He has a statistic that represents his direct belief in his system (the "Piety Ability"). But also telling, he has relationships to people with similar faiths like his temple community, priests, or the like. The character also potentially has personality traits that are associated with the faith. Meaning that the character acts, say, "Charitable" because his faith tells him that it is right to do so.<br/>
<br/>
This gives the player lots of mechanical incentive to be involved with his character's faith when looking at any question.<br/>
<br/>
To address specifically the notion of Polytheism as HQ deals with it, this means that, yes, the character has a relationship with his diety typically. Now, does that mean that it's a close, personal relationship? Possibly, but generally the notion for polytheism is that the relationship is one of worshipper to diety, and really quite distant. None the less potent, neccessarily. Just definitely not a peer relationship.<br/>
<br/>
This is as opposed to, say, animism. It could almost be said that animism is worship of small gods on a personal level. That is, the only difference, really, is that in animism the character has a personal relationship to one of the many spirits that are said to be the motive forces of the universe (and inhabitants of the spirit world). There are other differences, as defined (ecstatic worship for animism as opposed to sacrifice for polytheism).<br/>
<br/>
Monotheism is an even more distant relationship to a single god than polytheism.<br/>
<br/>
These are the three example methods of faith that HQ covers in depth - there are more in the HQ material, and they're not meant to be all-inclusive. But they tend to cover most of the religion types that are typical in the fantasy genre. That is, it's generally possible to do a good job of coming up with a description of a religion for a character by applying one of these three models, or by creating your own model by looking at how they vary.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I personally think that people's real world experiences through most of history have been much more magical than we think. That is, what you and I tend to ascribe to nature seems like grand magic to many cultures today, still, and almost all cultures before, say 1500 AD. As such, I think that "fantasy" as a genre is an interesting one. It's actually thinking about the world as being more like what everybody actually thought it was like wayback. That is, to an ancient Greek, what we call fantasy, they'd simply call fiction. Or maybe myth. It's only fantastical because we, today, tend to think of the world in non-magical materialist rationalist terms.<br/>
<br/>
Something to think about.<br/>
<br/>
For RPGs, however, all you have to do is to make the system address faith directly in some way, and the problems of faith become grist for the play mill.<br/>

                            Mike, that's an interesting post and I'd love to talk about it in depth with you sometime.  However, I do tend to think that issues of morality (in the sense of doing something that is Right or Wrong) and faith/belief are only really central to certain religious traditions, most of which come from Abrahamic and Hellenisic backgrounds.  My experience suggests that people from many religious traditions are not particularly concerned with whether you believe in certain gods or not or how deep your faith is or whatever.  I also think you're making some pretty broad statements about polytheism, animism, and monotheism that I don't necessarily agree with, but I don't think this is quite the place to discuss that.                        </div>

                            I was using rather Eurocentric examples, yes. But they were just examples. Focused mainly on the polytheistic take on things, since, ya know, that's the subject of the thread.<br/>
<br/>
What I've said applies equally to any belief system, if you take it in general terms. The important thing about enumerating a belief system is that it has to answer:<br/>
<br/>
"What values does it give you?" (even if that value is "nothing has any more meaning than anything else")<br/>
<br/>
"Who shares your beliefs?" (because humans are generally social, and it will tend to make a difference)<br/>
<br/>
"What is the source of life and/or power to which you relate?" (even if, again, it's to say "nothing," or "everything.")<br/>
<br/>
To whit, I have players regularly make up religions or belief systems that look nothing like polytheism, monotheism, animism, mysticism, or any other ism I've ever seen, using the HQ enumeration system.<br/>
<br/>
As for me making statements about these isms, the rules of HQ do associate certain models with certain in-game notions. As models, and one's made for Glorantha, they're certainly not going to match 100% everyone's vision of how such religions work. That said, I think that they do a remarkably good job of enumerating religions that one would associate with those isms in question. Greg being a shaman and all, you think he would know something about religion and animism in particular, you know.<br/>
<br/>
But, all that said, the fact is that they're just sample models. I tried to make this clear, but, as usual, it doesn't stick. The idea is not "OK, it has two or more beings called gods, so therefore we have to use the Theism model in Glorantha as written." The fact is that even in the case of the examples given, that there's a rather broad array of religions that are fit into these models. But where one would not, then one should either use the model that fits most closely, or create a new one. It's a mistaken impression that the game somehow forces everything into these particular models, when patently given things like "Lunar Magic" which don't fit into any of them at all (to the extent that they had to write an entire book on the subject) that's not how the game system works, or is intended to be used.<br/>
<br/>
To put it more suscinctly, you use the structures in the game when and where they suit your idea of how belief systems work. Where they don't, you either make up more, or just use a very general way of defining things.<br/>
<br/>
From another perspective, as Ron would put it, all of that structure is cruft added on top anyhow that's not at all neccessary. And he's right in that the core of it, that pertains to every belief system is that the system asks the questions that I list above.<br/>
<br/>
Any better? Overall, the answer to the more general question of how you awesemofie religion or the like is that you consider it from a mechanical basis that includes the subject matter of the faith instead of simply considering what kewl powerz it gives you.<br/>

                            just a thought, which is more game than philosophy. By using a mechanic like the one driving the thematic batteries in Full Ligh, Full steam to model ones own battel with doubt. [the mechanic being that you charge your thematic battery by taking a negative modifier to your next roll (and explaining how it hinders you)].<br/>
<br/>
Now you can do this with faith. Each time your character has doubts, and these mess him up, well here you go: charge faith. And then, at the moment you decide it all smacks into place and the doubt is gone the character has this big fat bonus to use to accenutate his return to the faithful.<br/>
And a character with no doubt, well he just stands there level. No problems, no strength. Just plain "boring" faith.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.                        </div>

                            Doubt about - indeed, focus on - the doctrinal content and epistemological status of one's religion is largely associated with religions influenced by Hellenistic philosophy. It's not necessarily the only, or the most interesting, religious question one can explore; it just tends to be the one that occurs most often to westerners.<br><br>But that wasn't what I came here to say. <br><br>StoneAgeMan mentions "Gods as Superheroes" - which totally works, because if you think about it superheroes are the literary descendants of mythic characters. In fact, Hercules and Thor got included in the Avengers, and the fit was very good.<br><br>Try reading the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenian_cycle" rel="nofollow">Fiannaidheacht</a> sometime. It's the damn X-Men. Everyone has a special power - some of them even have a secret origin; they fight enemies and each other, and the whole thing ends tragically.<br><br>"Gods as Aliens" also works really well (and is what Lois McMaster Bujold does in her Chalion series, mentioned in my earlier post). Leaving aside the nuttiness of Von Daniken, the reason his theories make any sense at all to anyone is that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from miracles, and gods do alien and incomprehensible things sometimes.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>
