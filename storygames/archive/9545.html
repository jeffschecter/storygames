Like, the games we make are already fighting pretty hard for limited places at each others' tables.  So I guess I think it's fine that a fair chunk of our creative output doesn't always see a lot of play and the play that does happen tends to revolve around a small constellation of games that people keep coming back to.  I also think that many small projects, in various stakes of being finished, inform other projects that may eventually receive wider appreciation.  How many piece of music do most composers put out in their lifetimes?  How many works are regularly performed?  But sometimes you have to put out a bunch of smaller pieces before you can write something big or important. I feel like that's a cool space to live in, with an overabundance of games of varying quality and done-ness.<br/><br/>Also, there's only so much control you can have over whether other people play your games, even if they are really good. If you don't run them at conventions and meetups, nobody may ever play them, even if they've bought copies from you.  And, honestly, if creators don't like their (micro)games enough to run them for other folks, maybe there's a reason that they were cast aside, unfinished.<br/><br/>Honestly, I really, really like the culture of micro-design, where everybody is capable of putting together something that's worth looking at, passing around, and in some cases playing for a session or two OR, in rare cases, playing a bunch of.  That's empowerment.  But I don't believe that everything worth doing is worth being preserved forever (Dev and I have differing discussions about data loss sometimes).  Roleplaying itself is ephemeral and I think it makes sense that a lot of game design work is as well.  It's not as if there are a finite number of ideas and that it's a grand tragedy that some are lost forever or unfinished.  There will always be too many things to do and not enough time to do them, whether that's design or play (which are really the same thing, yeah?).<br/><br/>I think the main tragedy of current indie design culture is that sometimes people do more designing than playing -- I know this has been the case for me at various points in my life, including the past month or so (thought that's about to change) -- which leads to some degree of detachment between the two sides of the coin of roleplaying.  You sometimes forget what you are actually designing for and game design becomes a thing in and of itself, which I don't think is necessarily a great environment for design.  It's like how people buy books as if they are buying time to read them.  I think sometimes I design games as if I'm creating play experiences that I want to have had, as a substitute for play, instead of play experiences that I plan on having in the near future.  But maybe that's just my own issues, I don't know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211727/#Comment_211727" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T15:09:07+00:00" title="June 11, 2009  3:09PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>*If this were true we'd all be playing Doug Ruff's<a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/the-dinner-party" rel="nofollow">The Dinner Party</a>.</blockquote>\nI never got around to that one!

Thus encouraging new designers to step up and design games was a fantastic thing.  The more new designers we had, the more new games where being made, the more awesomeness was available, the more alternatives to commercial trad titles there were.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen IMO we hit a critical mass of designers and games.  There are now already enough awesome games out there to fuel actual play for years to come.  The natural periodic release of new titles by already established designers comes pretty close to fulfilling the New &amp; Shiny fetish gamers of all stripes seem to have.  So I, for one, am much less interested in new designers or large volumes of new games.  I'm much more interested in seeing new titles from established designers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis, I admit, is pure selfishness on my part.  While there is a certain explosive potential in a Freshman design (the design of passion they've been waiting their whole life to release...the crazy idea no one ever told them was impossible), there's also alot to be said for the maturation and development of the craft that comes from a designer's ongoing efforts to refine their talent.  So for me, at this point...I'm much more interested in seeing the next design by an author whose name is already on my shelf, designed from the ground up to be a design they really wanted to do and now have the skills to pull off...then I am interested in taking a chance on a new designer or a game force fed through contest restrictions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211737/#Comment_211737" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T15:33:26+00:00" title="June 11, 2009  3:33PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing that's not been touched here is that I for one don't really think that micro-game design and design contests are there for social capital, or that these games should really be played. At least for me this stuff is purely a part of the artistic process on the way to doing something more concrete - concrete play, concrete product.

Or, rather, it takes a lot of time to compile and provide decent feedback, in addition to the time of playing. Of course, in my case there's also a language barrier involved, but hey...<br/>Same goes for APs of released titles, of course. We can't realistically expect all or even most play to produce AP reports; it's gonna be maybe 1/100 or 1/1000 of the play of a given game which gets reported, optimistically. So, when available titles are many, compared to the size of the gaming community, the play of more and more games will tend to become "invisible", in that it does not generate any AP reports.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211754/#Comment_211754" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T16:58:06+00:00" title="June 11, 2009  4:58PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>At least for me this stuff is purely a part of the artistic process on the way to doing something more concrete - concrete play, concrete product.

Very cool. It seems to be something either in the nature of RPGs or in the nature of their niche-ness that spins us off into lonely fun centered around the play of the game but not actually a distinct part of that play. Would things be different, I wonder, if all roleplaying gamers lived in, say, the same geographic region in the U.S.? Like if everyone were quarantined to the northwest? We'd have (or make) a hell of a lot more time for play, that's for sure. <br/><br/>This is an awesome thread. I've definitely thought of making my own game before (who hasn't?), and I've also had the thought of some others here: We already have so many games, what's the point of making one more? I suppose I'd ignore that question if I were passionate enough about making a game, so the fact that I don't probably says where I am.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you're not designing a game and want some shared lonely fun, play <a href="http://www.20by20room.com/2003/11/lexicon_an_rpg.html" rel="nofollow">Lexicon</a> with me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211764/#Comment_211764" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T17:30:06+00:00" title="June 11, 2009  5:30PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>At least for me this stuff is purely a part of the artistic process on the way to doing something more concrete - concrete play, concrete product.</blockquote>\nWhat makes you think that, Eero?

I was discoursing in opposition to the notion that there's something wrong with having lots of game contests and making games that do not get played. I have nothing against productizing small games - <i>Zombie Cinema</i> was originally specifically created as a demonstration of what sort of games come out of this micro game movement, for example. But even while games can be developed for production, I see nothing wrong with a public design process wherein we share idle design thoughts with others in preparation for serious work.<br/><br/>What I meant to say, in a nutshell: when I write something like <a href="http://isabout.wordpress.com/valravnar-for-asagrimmr/" rel="nofollow">Valravnar for \xc1sagrimmr</a> or <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=25794.msg248863#msg248863" rel="nofollow">Miss\xe4 miehet ratsastaa</a> for a competition, it's pure design for the sake of ideas - productization does not enter into it, I write the game to participate in the contest, and that is all it is. The participation itself is the self-contained benefit of participating. Thus concluding that I do it for social credibility or because I was supposed to create a finished product masterpiece seems shallow to me; those are not why I write micro-games. They have a real and concrete place in my game design hobby, and I can discuss that directly - that place is as a development stage for ideas that are on the way to becoming something for me or for other designers; for any given game it is completely coincidental whether it becomes a product or not.<br/><br/>Rereading Jason's original thesis, I have to say that I do somewhat disagree in that I <i>do</i> believe that the cream rises to the top. Or rather, I believe that idle micro games are such different beasts from finished product that tying the two together and making it a mission to make one into the other seems wrong-headed to me. This development from a quick micro game into a real product will only happen if a designer (not necessarily the original one) takes the game and does the real work of productizing the ideas. When we see excellent ideas seemingly abandoned and forgotten in these competitions (and each one produces these hidden gems, doubt it not), that's just an outsider viewpoint: do you not really think that the designer weighted seriously his own motivations and chose to develop or not develop the product? How do you know he didn't take the good bits of the game and design something else from the them? How do you know he isn't reserving the material for a product at a later date, when he has the time to work on it? I see no proof of any tragic waste.<br/><br/>I can see how the proliferation of public design (which micro games are - they are the first stages of design made public) might worry a person if he believed that these games are being made simply because they provide one with social credit. That would mean that instead of focusing on the challenging and tiring work of finishing product people were just creating micro-games as a substitute activity. I don't personally see how creating an untested micro game is a source of respect, though; the difference between a smart micro game and a real product is such a large one that I suggest making the latter to anybody who wants to make their name or whatever. Heck, even just writing playtest reports will probably bring more "cred" than constantly writing rough, unfinished games. Could be that others have different valuations, of course - I'm hardly the go-to guy for what's hot and what's not.<br/><br/>There is one, unsaid think I agree about with Jason, though: looking at the rpg scene in general, we probably should invest more in productization and marketing and proportionally less in game development. That might have something to do with micro games if people are designing them instead of doing useful work with the games they already have. Not I nor Jason can order people to stop designing and start productizing, though, so...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211781/#Comment_211781" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T18:27:27+00:00" title="June 11, 2009  6:27PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2009 6:33PM by madunkieg.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>These games are often crazy departures, bold experiments, wonderful ideas.</blockquote>\nI think this is at the centre of it. They're crazy ideas, clever, good for a laugh or some little bit of insight, but don't usually hold up as experiences worth investment of more time or money. The time limit of many contests (24 hours, 10 days) really contributes to this problem, as do the design constraints/challenges. Want an example? Take my game from Game Chef 2008, <i>Terribly Beautiful</i>. I loved the challenge the concept chose, but can you really see a market for a game about playing former prostitutes facing mortality due to incurable disease? Seriously? Because I can't. It was designed to fit within the contest constraints with no thought to a larger audience.<br/><br/>There are a couple of other factors that work in:<br/><br/>1. Burnout: both in having to take care of things in life that were neglected while devoting time to the contest, and in emotional drain, or sometimes managing to use designing the game to work through the emotional issues that inspired its creation.<br/><br/>2. Remaining elements: layout, artwork, and other things people might not be good at (or don't have enough money to get someone else to do well). Me, I like a beautiful game. My budget to pay artists is....let me check the coins in my pocket. And no, I won't settle for artwork that I feel looks just "okay". As someone who works in a bookstore, I know that people buy books by their appearance, so why publish something that I wouldn't be able to proudly show off and sell there?<br/><br/>I don't consider a "proof-of-concept" game to be a failure of a design contest to produce a publishable game. I consider "proof-of-concept" entries to be the ultimate achievement of a design contest, a sign that the contest pushed entrants to try something different, even if it didn't work quite right. The next step is for people (not just the designer of that game, but anyone who looks at an entry and learns from it) to take the ideas there and use them as inspiration to create something much greater. Note I said "create something," not "create something publishable."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211798/#Comment_211798" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T19:31:56+00:00" title="June 11, 2009  7:31PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: madunkieg</cite>Take my game from Game Chef 2008,<i>Terribly Beautiful</i>.

I guess I feel like what you want and what I want aren't necessarily different things and ultimately may happen through the same process. Like, if one of my games ever has a prized place on your shelf, it will probably be because I wrote a bunch of crap games, semi-finished games, and merely okay games somewhere along the way.</blockquote>\nActually that makes total sense.

Brand, your comment about micro-games being the New Lonely Fun is awesome and probably true.  <br/><br/>I really think there's room for every approach - people making games as iterative design steps (I know bits of contest games I've made have gone on to become part of other, more viable projects, and not just my own), people making games to be cool, people making games as art, as process, as personal fulfillment, as lonely fun.  That's all happening now, it's great.  <br/><br/>Maybe the big question isn't "how can we get these games played more?" but rather "how can we identify a creator's intent and support that?"  And a big step in that direction would be for designers to actually tell us in the text why they are making the game and what they want.

Now that the theory arguments are mostly gone, I think it's great that contests are doing their job.<br/><br/>I figure on at least 18 months from design impulse to finished game (allowing exceptions, of course). That means that we should be seeing games finished now from contests in the middle of '07 and before. The contests from the past 12 months, it's too early to worry about. Anybody feel like looking up the contests in 2007?<br/><br/>I also figure that the real development work will overshadow the game's association with the contest; by the time the game's done, will we even remember that it came from a contest? I remember very clearly, 18 months after the Iron Game Chef that produced Polaris and Ganakagok, people complaining about how design contests didn't lead to real games. <b>edit:</b> And the Mountain Witch!

The Mountain Witch was actively pursued over the course of 18 months or so, but shit, it's taken me three years to get Xenon: into a shape where it's actually a game instead of abstract shapes on the inside walls of my skull or a deeply unfun implementation of those abstract shapes. It's probably going to be something like another year before it's a published <em>product</em>. If I'm lucky, it'll have its d\xe9butante party at Dreamation 2010 (the year we make contact).</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the much simpler <a href="http://glyphpress.com/UtB/" rel="nofollow">Under the Bed</a> was a game that went from concept to creation in the span of a few months. It was subject matter that I'd wanted to address for a couple of years, though, and I put concerted effort into that little 32-page booklet. It's probably something like 3000 words, and I was doing it in a deliberately simple fashion to learn how to conceive, design, and publish. I've sold a couple hundred copies of the game and <a href="http://www.tao-games.com/" rel="nofollow">Ben Lehman wrote a Monkey King supplement for it</a>, which is the cutest thing in the Universe. But its inspiration was the discovery that The Wizard of Oz is in Project Gutenberg, and I started thinking about publishing it (still might!), a year earlier.</p>\n<p>So, yeah. It takes time. It takes time, resolve, and most of all, it takes the excellence of your starting material. If you design a game that won't actually be fun to play in 18 months, you're not going to pursue it. You'll lose interest because you'll either start work on something better or you'll try to maintain faith in something that doesn't deserve it. Sturgeon's law applies doubly to incomplete work that's running around in your own head.

To develop your skill at an art, you must practice. Practice, in the case of game design, involves actually designing games (not just discussing theory, although that is often interesting and enlightening), and the more games you design, the more your skill as a designer will develop. There are, of course, notable exceptions as mentioned above of first-time prodigies and the like, but the vast majority of us still just have to plug away and do the work and put in our ten thousand hours. <br/><br/>The most important thing to keep in mind when practicing an art is: you will produce mostly garbage. This is a good thing. You don't have to publish the garbage, or play|test it, or even show it to people, but you will have to produce it to make it to the good stuff. Failure in this respect is not only inevitable, but essential. In my mind, this is where these design contests aid greatly. They provide contexts that allow people to bust out some fast, bold sketches, and although the desire is to do the best work possible (and often to gain the respect and admiration of one's peers), the result is often that the best work possible at the time is not very good. But that's okay! That is, in fact, wonderful, because it is another step towards the things that are very good indeed, and without taking that step, you'll just sit there and dream about the things that are very good indeed without ever getting closer to producing them.<br/><br/>That said, game design (like some other interactive or performative arts) are peculiar in that they require an active audience to be experienced fully, and thus is it difficult to get the full benefit of the practice without involving other people. (For example, you can rehearse your theater or practice improvisation all day, but when you face an audience with your fellow performers, that's when the real experience comes.) So, in the process of learning our craft, we will inevitably present things that are not very good to an indulgent audience who will hopefully provide honest and useful feedback, so we can go back and create more things that are not very good again and again, until we eventually strike gold. I believe that these small design contests provide an invaluable resource for this aspect of learning the art of game design, as well. I enjoy "lonely fun" as much as the next person (and I think that Brand's observation to that above is right on), but I think that there's only so far that will take you, design-wise. <br/><br/>As to Jason's original question of how to get these games played more often, I have no idea. Maybe many of these games just don't need to be played more than a couple times before we say, okay, I learned something from that, let's move on. I think the ways to get them played more are either: as a designer, push push push to get your game played, work for it until you can't push any more; or work work work, until you produce something that is so irresistible that people cannot help but play it, and thus provide you with the feedback that you desperately need. And as individuals in a community, if we are interested in promoting the creation and play of these small games, it is our responsibility to take on both of those roles ourselves: push our playmates to play the quirky little games that we love, and continue to create or start more micro-contests or do whatever we can do to let more of the games inside our heads see the light of day. And really, I think we're doing a fair job of both of those already.<br/><br/>In short, yay us, and yay contests.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212363/#Comment_212363" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-15T11:25:40+00:00" title="June 15, 2009 11:25AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's interesting, I find myself agreeing simultaneously with completely varied ideas on the subject of game design contests here.<br/><br/>In my own part (I run the "game chef" site these days, but by no means have a monopoly on game design contests or anything), I ran that event for the same reason I developed the Indie RPG Awards, picked up 24 Hour RPGs from Philip Reed's great idea, and even the development of Story Games:<br/><br/><i>I was supposed to be working on something else, but I got bored with that so focused on this instead</i>.<br/><br/>From a contest designer viewpoint, I loved doing it each year, even despite the rules-needling and some bad feedback: It's basically a fireworks of ideas. Every year I ran it save one I participated in it anonymously as well (in one case failing, twice kinda-succeeding). And it basically helped me do the following:<br/>* Write a lot, fast.<br/>* Be creative within constraints, and push myself to turn brain-bubbles into cohesive ideas in quick time.<br/>* Then throw it all together in a critical document in an organized fashion.<br/><br/>Sure, it's not "real", and none of the games were really playable, but in the end that experience helped me on my other projects where I've had to do pretty much the same thing but in a longer time period. <br/><br/><b>It's not real game design. <i>It's training wheels for real game design</i></b>. <br/><br/>I'm VERY wary of stuff that gets published from these contests, even (though some people made that leap, and for the most part it's been great). But nothing's really come along in terms of reasons or feedback to make me think, "Y'know, this is a useless exercise that causes lots of bloat and no real results". Not everything need be played.<br/>It reminds me of the Real Iron Chef, actually: The chef takes some bizarre ingredient (natto, water, lettuce, mushrooms, etc, depending on the week) and makes 3-4 signature dishes with them. Often, they are delicious. Sometimes, they are mediocre.<br/><br/>But not in any single case are these dishes meant to be "mass produced", "recreated", "perfected". The Iron Chefs go back to their restaurants and decidedly <b>do not</b> add the creations from Kitchen Stadium onto their menus. It was a one-time thing, basically an explosion of craft, experience and creativity. The only real difference between us and them is that it's food instead of games, and they're pros who do it for a living while we're hobbyists. So at the end of the day, I'm content with the fact that most of us don't return back to our home kitchens and turn that Kitchen Stadium food-explosion into a premier menu item; it was a one-time gig, a piece of craft produced for one event, and perhaps training to make something better, more permanent, on our own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212369/#Comment_212369" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-15T11:35:27+00:00" title="June 15, 2009 11:35AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2009 12:41PM by Andy.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, forgot to add:<br/><br/>Another big thing is that when I created Game Chef (edit: When I created the Game Chef website thingy; Mike Holmes was the one that originally did the contest on the Forge; and Sorensen before him over on Gaming Outpost), I was kinda bored with the games that were coming out, both mainstream and indie. That is, there was juuuust enough of interest to keep me wanting more.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I've had a few breakthroughs in the last 2-3 years with my Japanese language skills. This is unfortunate because the world of Japanese tabletop games went for me from "a pretty series of books to buy, thumb through and put on my bookshelf" to "accessible, readable and even - gasp - playable products that fill out my gaming repertoire". So aside from English mainstream and English indie games, I've got this pool of really cool games other there to experience as well (some deeply, others at a shallow level). That, plus the fact that the recent release of cool mainstream and indie games lately has been sating my RPG-hobby-palate, it's been harder to think recently about what I ultimately want to do with the contest (that is, for the last few years I've known kinda what I wanted to use as "the theme"; but this year I've got nothin').<br/><br/>Anyway, the contest will likely go down come September or so. The fall. I've got a few months to finish up my current herculean-level project, and hopefully by then inspiration will strike.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doug%20Ruff" title="Doug Ruff"><img alt="Doug Ruff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doug%20Ruff">Doug Ruff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212441/#Comment_212441" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-15T15:31:54+00:00" title="June 15, 2009  3:31PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi,<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's been a long time since I last posted here (I just haven't been playing or writing anything for quite a while so I gradually stopped talking about it as well.) Seeing this by chance inspired me to come back and say "hi". Good to see some familiar faces still here.<br/>\n<br/>\nJason: you've also inspired me to do something else which I haven't done for a very long time, which is to go back and read <i>The Dinner Party</i> again. With the benefit of 4 year's hindsight, there are certainly a lot of things that I would do differently with it now that I'm not trying to win a competition with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think that although the constraints set by a contest inspire creativity, they limit <i>vision</i> - there is a point at which the author has to say "fuck it", tear up the contest rules and just <i>create</i> - and in most cases that won't happen until after the contest, when everyone is knackered and discussion has died down. It certainly didn't happen for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn't a dig - I think the contests are great, it's totally my responsibility to get on with that creative process afterwards, and nobody else's fault if I don't do it. I just think that a fair bit of the creative energy created by the contests goes to waste because it is focused upon meeting the goals the contest itself (and especially the rules) rather than creating the best possible game (unless of course, your main goal is the contest itself, in which case, fair play to you!)<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nDoug                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212449/#Comment_212449" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-15T15:40:13+00:00" title="June 15, 2009  3:40PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had the beginnings of an outline for a game for the BPG Aeromachine challenge and had written the first page or so of text, when I realized that I myself didn't really want to play the game I was designing.

I totally agree with this.  I think you either need to just embrace that and know your little darling isn't going anywhere, or design knowing that the day after the contest you'll tear out some element shoe-horned in just to meet requirements, or allow the contest to inspire you but ignore the rules, don't enter, and go your own way.  Not enough people choose option three, I suspect.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212540/#Comment_212540" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-16T04:38:50+00:00" title="June 16, 2009  4:38AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The other thing people forget is that contests are, in my opinion, for new people.
