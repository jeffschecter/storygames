Basically how things work is you pay a set up fee for them to prepare their screens ($30 a color) then beyond the first design you pay monthly for warehousing of screens up to $50 a month. The reason I wanted to post up for you folks is that for the grand opening today they are offering the $50 monthly account level for a single lifetime payment of $50. Again I am not affiliated with the company beyond being a customer and just wanted to point out a limited time resource for people.<br/><br/>Seth Drebitko<br/><a href="http://www.koboldenterprise.com" rel="nofollow">MicroLite20</a> ~ The adventure's just begun!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
