It was spacious and nice, had a sauna, good food and areas for play and lectures.<br/>* Personally achieving a good mix between doing and listening.<br/>* All the good people!  It's fantastic to spend a weekend with so many people who share my interests from all over the world. <br/>* The organizers were very helpful and service-minded and seemed, well, organized.<br/>* Three books! Wow!<br/>* Fantasiforbundet and Martin Nielsen organizing the trip for around 40 (?) Norwegians. Nice bunch! Strengthened a few friendships, got some new. <br/>* The starting game: a good way to break the ice and become warm before the convention proper<br/>* The Tribunal: a cool, short larp with semi-political content. Lot's of good role playing going on, high intensity. <br/>* Child's play: a bit of physical warm up in the morning was good<br/>* The walkabout project: Very interesting project in the grey area between performance and larp, presented in an understandable way<br/>* The pub: socializin', getting to know people, finding good contacts for the Playground news section<br/>* Loosing the loosing game before it even started, and having time for the Playground release party instead<br/>* Morning energizer: again; nice to warm up before the day's program items started<br/>* Willfull action: nice little improvisational practice, good to exercise those muscles<br/>* Manipulating for good: only saw the first half. Many good presentations and an interesting problem to be addressed<br/>* This is your dream: zoning out and into the dream without safety nets in the form of many formalized rules and meta techniques. A highly fragile illusion which worked for me. <br/>* Jeep in the forest: very cool project of "larp embedding", and a good format with questions from the audience along the way<br/>* A Doomsday's Eve: One of the best presentations I saw, with video and insightful commentary by Christer. An apocalyptic larp where the world was brought to the brink of nuclear war.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_314138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314138/#Comment_314138" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-24T13:04:00+00:00" title="February 24, 2011  1:04PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2011 1:05PM by Emily_Care.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Congratulations, Matthijs!

Johanna MacDonald and Aarni Korpela ran it. They're doing something in between performance and larp, exploring that "grey area" (this is just from my recollection of their presentation). The projects have been based on the archetypes from the major arcana in the tarot "even though it's a bit cheesy it gives some kind of framework to the audience/participants/players". This summer they will hold their third installation/performance/whatever in Helsinki, "The Lovers' Match-Making Agency. For all kinds of encounters and relationships From jogging partners to soulmates From seconds to a lifetime From ridiculous to sublime", based on the card "The Lovers". I consider going. <a href="http://walkabout.happeningfish.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://walkabout.happeningfish.com/</a> will supposedly be up soon.<br/> <br/>The "This is your dream" game was based on the installation Hermitii, based on the Hermit card, which had to do with the tarot card of the same name and was about withdrawal and reflection. The "game" itself consisted of an introduction where we were asked to "perceive the world as if a dream", there were not many set rules and "no wrong way of playing it". There was a sort of ritual countdown/intro with closing of eyes and Johanna singing a song about The Sandman, then people started "dreaming". A lot of the players generated entire dreamlike narratives where everyday objects were viewed as something else. Personally I played it more as a deriv\xe9, something in this style: <a href="http://grant-morrison.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=195&amp;Itemid=83" rel="nofollow">http://grant-morrison.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=195&amp;Itemid=83</a> (see Exercise 1 and 2 under \u201cmagical consciousness\u201d).<br/><br/>We moved amongst the other con goers, marked with yellow bands around our arms to indicate we were playing. The illusion was very fragile, it was very easy to go \u201coff-game\u201d in your head. But I enjoyed it quite a lot, especially a few interactions with non-players and fellow players were cool. <br/><br/>Matthijs might add some more details, as he also participated. <br/><br/><b>Jeep in the forest</b><br/>A group of jeepers created two larps-within-a-larp. They had a group of fanatical Christians at a Viking larp in Denmark. They were a bit separate from the other players, and had some pretty hardcore play amongst themselves. Then they had sort of a third larp where they moved away from the main larp altogether every couple of days. In this larp they played the characters (more or less) from the Viking larp, but in a modern day setting (a traditional Swedish celebration of Midsummer\u2019s Eve). They had different rules covering how to act within the different settings, for instance \u201cevery kindness in one setting has to be repaid by unkindness in the other and vice versa\u201d. Again, Matthijs\u2019 might want to provide further details. I\u2019m unsure whether the larp(s) is documented online. Try to ask Tobias Wrigstad for further details (he was part of the group).  Maybe something will turn up on <a href="http://jeepen.org" rel="nofollow">http://jeepen.org</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_314166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314166/#Comment_314166" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-24T21:40:19+00:00" title="February 24, 2011  9:40PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was part of the Walkabout two years ago, but sadly I haven't been able to get back to KP since then.
