                    I present to you the new <b><a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/12/09/crowdfunding-collection-89/" rel="nofollow">Crowdfunding Collection no. 89, including every tabletop project started between 11/25 and 12/09.</a></b><br/><br/>Quite some interesting projects have went live within the last two weeks. For example <b>Tale</b>, a fantasty rpg with some very interesting illustration and a solid project design. Though in conversation with fans of fantasy rpgs <b>Low Fantasy Gaming</b> is well worth having a look. Well, and I consider the design the game <b>Queste</b> nice.<br/>I am not as much smitten by the looks, but by the science fiction setting and game system of <b>Termination Shock</b> by Greg Stolze. The setting should be accessible to new players and the idea to read several information from one roll, looks enticing. I am considering backing it. <b>Nibiru</b> is more to my taste in visually, yet the system isn’t exactly what I am looking for, though I do think it is working and solid. Check it for yourself.<br/>I found it difficult to categorize the two games which I sorted under „RPG-adjenct games“. On the one hand there is <b>Situations</b>, which sees players collaboratively creating a story, though without feeling like an actual rpg or even story game rpg. <b>The Noticeboard</b> is somewhat of a more traditional boardgame, yet according to its creator, with quite some options to utilize it for tabletop rpg.<br/>Next to those I got somewhat intrigued by <b>Into the Wyrd</b>, a horror setting for D&amp;D.  With <b>Nile Empire</b> you’ll find a supplement for Torg and <b>Vagabond’s Cyclopedia</b> one for Vagabond’s of Dyfed.<br/>Though there are many, many more supplements, adventures and other cool projects:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>4 Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Science Fiction Role-Playing Games<br/>2 RPG adjenct games<br/>3 Settings<br/>2 Supplements<br/>4 D&amp;D Supplements<br/>5 Adventures<br/>8 Dice Projects<br/>2 Apps &amp; Tools<br/>2 Card Projects<br/>2 Notebooks<br/>3 Maps &amp; Tiles<br/>1 Various RPG Project<br/>2 Various Games<br/><br/><b>Spanisch Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>2 Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Adventures<br/>1 Map Project<br/><br/><b>French Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>3 Role-Playing Games<br/><br/><b>Italian Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>2 Role-Playing Games<br/><br/>Blog-Article: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/12/09/crowdfunding-collection-89/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2018/12/09/crowdfunding-collection-89/</a> </div>

                            I present to you the new <a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/12/31/crowdfunding-collection-90/" rel="nofollow">Crowdfunding Collection no. 90, including every tabletop project started between 12/09 till 12/31</a>.<br/><br/>Welcome to the last Crowdfunding Collection of 2018.<br/>In regards of the projects I am enticed by <b>They Came from Beneath the Sea!</b>. The game offers a pulp SF setting along the movies and narratives of the 50s. I had the chance to play the game during GenCon and it was quite some fun, plus I do consider the author very reliable. Thus I recommend it even though I couldn’t yet squeeze it into my budget.<br/>If you would rather prefer fantasy games you might like to check out <b>Map Maker Adventures</b>. Fans of a more fantastical Rome should take a look at <b>Maelstrom Rome</b>.<br/>In regards of game books you’ll find that <b>Choose Your Way Micro Action Booklets</b> does offer some small adventures. While I personally felt tempted by the <b>Silent Titans</b> OSR adventure.<br/>If you fancy a look across the plate, maybe check out the <b>Record of Dragon Wars</b> project by the German Uhrwerk publisher. It’s their take on a Record of Lodoss Wars setting, with a OSR inspired rule set. Fitted to be suited for beginners.<br/>There are plenty more projects to take a look at, thus go forth and slide comfortably into the new year.<br/><br/><b>German Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>4 Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Gamebook<br/>3 Supplements<br/>4 Adventures<br/>4 Dice Projects<br/>2 Coin &amp; Token Projects<br/>1 Enamel Pin<br/>1 Soundscape<br/>3 Various RPG Projects<br/><br/><b>Spanish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>2 Role-Playing Games<br/><br/><b>French Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Gamebook Collection<br/><br/><b>Swedish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/><br/><b>Italian Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Setting<br/><br/>Article: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/12/31/crowdfunding-collection-90/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2018/12/31/crowdfunding-collection-90/</a> </div>
