The idea is, during character creation, you'd each get a handful of blank dice, and a sheet of multicoloured stickers.  There are four colours of sticker - Blue is "Might" Red is "Agility", Green is "Cunning" and Yellow is "Power".  You have (eight?) total stickers, of any colour, and three blank dice.  You choose how to stick the stickers to your dice.  You can choose to stick six on one die, and two on another, and leave one blank.  You can go three, three, two, or one, one, six, or whatever you like.   You've also got to decide what colours to put where, and in what ratio.<br/><br/>During play, you roll these dice to power your character's abilities.  For example, smashing things might require you to roll at least one Might dot.  Figuring out the puzzle would require a Cunning dot.  Special abilities would require combinations of different types of dot.  Especially powerful abilities would require multiple dots of a single colour.<br/><br/>You'd earn stickers through play, and get to choose where to stick them.  You could also earn more dice at various stages, which would unlock more powerful abilities.<br/><br/>The way I see it, there'd be some pretty deep character design involved in this.  Or possibly there's an optimum strategy that's really obvious, and I'm missing it.  Possibly it would work better with coins, rather than dice.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125906/#Comment_125906" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T22:02:18+00:00" title="February 11, 2008 10:02PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ron's game <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/articles/22/" rel="nofollow">Black Fire</a> does this, so maybe it's worth tracking down the AP threads on the Forge to see how the stickers + dice worked out.<br/><br/>I like the idea of earning stickers, that's nifty.<br/><br/>I had an idea to try something like this using different die-sizes, which I put into a game called <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/rats/rats.pdf" rel="nofollow">Rats</a>. The idea is each character gets six dice. They can have any mix of dice from d4 to d10. So you might take 2d4 1d6 1d8 2d10. Or 1d4 5d8.<br/><br/>Then, when you roll in a challenge, you roll all your dice. 2s, 3s, and 4s are Fighting successes; 5s, 6s, and 7s are Sneaking successes, and 8s, 9s and 10s are Cunning successes.<br/><br/>Kinda similar, but with a different kind of curve on the results. I do think that representing a character purely with a pile of dice is an idea worth puzzling out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/brettmb" title="brettmb"><img alt="brettmb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/brettmb">brettmb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125908/#Comment_125908" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T00:03:28+00:00" title="February 12, 2008 12:03AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.pigames.net/store/product_info.php?products_id=356" rel="nofollow">BONES</a> does this and I'm working on a GMless dungeon-specific version.

I'd say something akin to "at least one side must be blank or of another color" (to go along with the requisite "every die must have at least one sticker on it"). Of course, that leaves a 17.X% chance of not rolling a success on your "Might die," which could be bad--one would have to run the stat math across the system, to figure out appropriate Difficulties.<br/><br/>Still... kind of a neat idea. I wonder what might be accomplished, instead, by putting a colored Sharpie dot on the side of a numbered die! You get this weird, potentially orthogonal relationship between successes and colors. (One could put, say, a Might dot on a 1 or a 6, and count successes as the sum of those sides which come up the right color dot.) Hmmm... I suppose this might also want an "overpower" mechanic as a check--Difficult is actually a range: too low, miss; too high, miss with complication--otherwise folks will always dot from their highest to lowest values. Then, of course, one could pick and choose what to roll. Hmmm... And that would probably lead to folks "gaming" the system by distributing dots across all numeric values possible, so every die ends up sort of "tuned" to favor a given Difficulty range for a given check.<br/><br/>Anyhow... rambling. Neat idea, though. About the only thing that gets to me is that, in such a game, a character has a REAL cost: the dice you (sticker, mark, or ruin) to make it! Folks who like to hoard character designs would end up with a BIG box of dice in smaller bags, one per character.<br/><br/>Oh, God... and what about NPCs? *shudder* You thought having a mini for the Monster of the Week was an expense? Try having, say, ten new dice for it! Hmmm... gotta be with stickers, definitely. All-the-better, if the stickers are made of the "restickable" vinyl and the dice are smooth enough to accept that: then a "character sheet" (PC or NPC) could be a sheet of some kind of plastic which encodes each d6 as a row of dots, ready to be stuck to the dice on-the-fly. Nope, definitely can't use Sharpie... or maybe you could, but would have to be diligent about repeating a dice/dot combo, if you already have one made (unless you decide you need more than one in a given scene/character).<br/><br/>Lots to consider, here....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126059/#Comment_126059" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T15:32:26+00:00" title="February 12, 2008  3:32PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, that's a lot of interesting ideas.  I really love the added compexity of having numbers to go with the colours, and you're right, you'd need something more complex than "high is good".  Perhaps it would work best if they're tied to some mechanic that is totally unrelated to success.  Maybe an "Otherkind"y type of thing, where the numbers represent how many people get killed because of the activity?  So your lies can send dozens to their deaths. <br/><br/>For NPCs, I think I'd take a page from "Hero Quest" (The board game, not the rpg, for once), and have different NPC dice, with a set number of dots.  Then NPC abilities would work totally differently.  I like the idea that NPCs would be defined by a handul of abilities, like "Smash things", "Lie Convincingly", "Escape" and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126060/#Comment_126060" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T15:43:40+00:00" title="February 12, 2008  3:43PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite><cite>Posted By: Jarrod</cite>If I'm a combat monster, I assign 6 Might stickies to one die.</blockquote>\nI thought of that too (as a "problem") and figured it should be disallowed in the rules.

No reason that should be true. Say Lance has four or five dice with 5 dots of Might and, as such, has an 83% chance of a success on each die: he's a Mighty Rider. (Of course, winning a cycle race might take 1 Might, 1 Cunning, and 2 Power successes, but....)<br/><br/>And I wouldn't say "boring," <i>per se</i>... rather, I'd say... actually, yeah, boring sums it up well: where's the "tension" in--hell, what's the <i>point of</i>--a non-random randomizer? Put another way, when one makes a six-matched-dots die, one needn't even make the die or ever roll it: just put on your sheet somewhere that you always have 1 success with the relevant stat, and use one less die to make your character.<br/><br/>There's a broad distinction between "enable players to play the character they want" and "character never fails at FOO"--it's not a binary dichotomy--and I would have the system resist the latter by disallowing an "auto-success" die. Lance doesn't win every <i>stage</i> of a race, does he?<br/><br/>Mind you, I wouldn't go to the other extreme and require a failure side--a minus-one to number of successes--on every die, either. Rather, I'd allow a player to gain additional colored dots for each X (failure) dot they are willing to apply. Maybe make a sliding scale (i.e. 1 to 3 extra dots at 1 X-side per dot; 4 to 6 extra dots at 2 X-sides per dot; etc); but I'd <i>definitely</i> want failure side(s) to be a player's risk/reward choice, not intrinsic in every die. (Heh, even though a 1 always fails in my new game... but it uses different die sizes, so it's not forcing a 17% chance of failure--or, rather, one nullified success--on each die.)<br/><br/>Hmmm... and any notion of "character level" is represented by the number of dice he or she may have. So you end up with two vectors for advancement: new colored dots and new blank dice. The interplay of those two could be a pretty cool way to echo or reinforce the system's setting (level or rank increases, new or stronger affiliations, new or upgraded equipment, whatever).<br/><br/>I SURE ramble on, eh...?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126158/#Comment_126158" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-13T07:49:59+00:00" title="February 13, 2008  7:49AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>Oh, God... and what about NPCs?</blockquote>\nA couple of possibilities: only PCs roll dice (like InSPectres or Dragonlance Fifth Age), or even there are only PCs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126227/#Comment_126227" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-13T11:26:59+00:00" title="February 13, 2008 11:26AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if you make failure desirable in some way? You don't get what you want when you fail, but you do get some other kind of Neat Thing. (Character advancement maybe? You learn from your failures, not your successes?)<br/><br/>The <i>option</i> to make a character who never fails at FOO would still be there, but that ability would hamper the character in other ways. Perfect for the "Every time I sit down to work on my Great Atlantean Novel, someone pounds on my door complaining about dragons or something.

As to whether you can have multiple dots on a single side or dots get replaced... would depend on the game flavour. I like the idea of building the dice over time, by adding multiple dots.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
