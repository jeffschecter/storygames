I'm going to try to avoid it because I think while it's a step in the right direction it also looks like an incremental step rather than a big one, and I can't really play with it (design-wise) like I can play with the five shelves of OGL material I already own.  <br/><br/>I planned on taking 2008 off from d20-based design, to give me a chance to look at other games and to incorporate lessons learned in 4e into my own designs.  But reading the Red Box Hack, thinking about collectible RPGs, and the change from the OGL to the GSL has me thinking about d20 all the time.  I want a game that has a very simple substructure and lots of room for feats; a game that plays really fast but where players can still have fun with the crunchy bits.  That said, I think most people who love D&amp;D for what it is would hate my game.  This would be a game that\u2019s designed for me.<br/><br/><b>Stuff I Don\u2019t Like:</b><br/><br/>1)  D&amp;D has too many Abilities.  The original six ability scores need examining.  Intelligence and Wisdom are conflated, as are Wisdom and Charisma (now that Will is a save).  Constitution, via Fortitude, was beefed up into a proper ability in 4e but the function it serves - letting tough characters exist - could easily have been handled by feats.  <br/>2)  D&amp;D has too many different kinds of resources.  You don't need to stratify your renewable resources into 9, 10, 30 or any other combination of levels.  Say "characters have a renewable resource" and give them character specific ways of spending it.  Even hit points \u2013 when you\u2019re talking about a few dozen 6th-level mooks, for example \u2013 are a pain to keep track of.<br/>3)  D&amp;D has too many games in it.  Other games can handle fantasy supers, I\u2019m going to focus on heroic fantasy.<br/>4)  D&amp;D has too many subsystems - monster special abilities, spells, feats would all be 1 system.  <br/>5)  D&amp;D just needs 1 scale - it doesn't need 5 slightly different but related scales (ability-based actions, attacks and ACs, saves and spell DCs, skills).  Everything in d20 already works basically like d20 + Stat + Level-based benefit; let that be the scale and tune feats around that.<br/>6)  The d20 is too random.  Crits happen a bit too often and players fear-agression up to higher levels to control the fact they can't count on their own abilities. (aah!  aah! it hurts!)<br/>7)  Counting squares is ALSO boring, but tactical positioning has some merits.<br/>8)  Turns are too long; the players shouldn\u2019t be agonizing on how to combine different actions, and the GM shouldn\u2019t have to manage dozens of mooks. <br/>9)  There are meaningless rolls. I hate meaningless rolls.<br/>10) There is fudging.  I hate fudging.<br/>11) The GM has a lot of things to manage.<br/><br/><b>What I\u2019d Do About It</b><br/><br/>1) I\u2019d have 4 abilities.  Might, Agility, Insight, and Will define characters nicely.  Toughness and Charm can be defined with feats.<br/>2) 2 Resources, with easy to remember names:  Hit Points and Mana.  They\u2019ll have similar scales.  The Hit point scale will change to make it easier to track (i.e. can be tracked with ticks instead of numbers).  <br/>3) The stuff that happens between levels 1 and 10 is the interesting stuff for me, so basically I\u2019m sticking with E6\u2019s methodology here.<br/>4) 1 system of abilities; basically, feats.  Monster feats aren\u2019t necessarily balanced against character feats, but they\u2019re still called feats.<br/>5) 1 scale, based around Stat+Level.  More detail can be handled with feats rather than by conflating subsystems in the structure of the math.  If you suck at something you don\u2019t get to add your level.<br/>6)  2d6 is a better curve, and a better set of dice.  Boxcars = awesome.  Snake eyes = suck.  This is something we all know from many other games.  Even Monopoly has trained us for this mechanic.<br/>7)  Counting squares is boring.  I like Red Box Hack\u2019s arena system; with a few abilities for monsters, I think it could be even better.<br/>8)  1 Action per round is a great mechanic.  Maybe you\u2019ll get more if you spend Mana, that\u2019s fine.  But you don\u2019t have three or four decisions to make on your turn.  Also, I don\u2019t think the GM should have more than 3 NPCs to manage in a typical combat, unless it\u2019s a major battlefield where maybe 6 or 7 NPCs are appropriate.  Troops can be done as special abilities for other NPCs (or PCs for that matter).  <br/>9)  Red Box Hack\u2019s danger system, and In A Wicked Age\u2019s dice system are good sources of ideas for how to fix meaningless rolls.  At the same time, feats are a great way to package \u201csucceed or nothing\u201d stakes.  <br/>10) All dice are in plain sight, and effects are obvious.  Game\u2019s designed around no fudging.  Give players some control over PC death with the Death Flag that can be raised for extra Mana.<br/>11) Take a few things out of the GM\u2019s hands.  Players track damage dealt to monsters and who\u2019s initiative turn it is.  Players roll all the dice (GM side is the side with the static number, players have the random element).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127056/#Comment_127056" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-16T14:43:31+00:00" title="February 16, 2008  2:43PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 16, 2008 2:45PM by Ry.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bah.

I'd rather a good game.)<br/><br/>2. What is the purpose of levels in this game?<br/><br/>3. Will all characters have a Mana resource, and just use it in different ways (so, maybe warriors can spend Mana to power super martial arts feats, thieves can spend it to wriggle their way out of a pair of "unbreakable" handcuffs, etc)?<br/><br/>4. Are characters going to be as complicated and time-consuming to create as in D&amp;D, or are you going for more a quick pick-up feel?<br/><br/>5. What's Insight? Does it cover intelligence?

At the top of the page there'd be a feat that was the "entry" feat into the rest.  Your class OR race gives you a free entry feat, and each level you get 1 feat from your class/race page and 1 feat of your choosing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127064/#Comment_127064" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-16T15:28:47+00:00" title="February 16, 2008  3:28PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 16, 2008 3:29PM by Ry.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul - <br/>1.  Being able to do direct conversion (or just using as-is) would drag in too much crap that I'd rather be rid of.  So I'd like to convert some of those "in spirit."  Some kind of generalized mapping between the two systems.    <br/><br/>2.  Level is the stat that you get to add to everything your character is basically good at.  Characters go through the 6 levels fairly quickly and then from then on only advance via feats.  (Cribbed from E6) Levels 1 to 6 is the period where a character comes into his own, where a crash course in action and danger transforms them from 1st-level commoners into capable fighting men (or corpses). <br/><br/>3.  All characters will have Mana but use it in different ways.  Exactly as you say.<br/><br/>4.  Quick pick-up feel, if you see the way I'm doing feats as pages in my last post you'll see how characters won't have QUITE the same tyrrany of choice as they do with feats right now.  You'll have a choice between entry feats or feats within pages you've already entered.  This will be the same even after other feats.<br/><br/>5.  Insight is alertness / perception / intelligence.  Basically, take the 3 mental stats of D&amp;D and split them in half.  One is force of personality, the other is ability to think.  Intelligence has a lot of modern connotations, but Insight is something that Odysseus could have been described as having, and it's very relevant to an adventurer's life.  It's the thing you use to figure out that it's an illusion, or that the golden monkey statue's head can swivel but it might be a trap.    Book learning / math problem intelligence can be handled by feats if it's important to a character / campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127073/#Comment_127073" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-16T17:10:38+00:00" title="February 16, 2008  5:10PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Savage Worlds and TSOY are both sytems that address a variety of these issues.<br/><br/>Savage Worlds addressed the "one or more actions a round" with a simpler ruleset approach and takes the "mooks" approach to enabling fast combat with large numbers of critters while letting every one of those be a "more significant monster" if needed (a skeleton that is an unworthy foe and one that is a "wild card" are different foes).<br/><br/>TSOY has been referred to as "d20 with the serial numbers filed off and rebuilt" (by its creator possibly).

I took the mechanic (d20 + modifier vs. target number) and threw out virtually everything else.<br/><br/>So, no attributes, skills, or feats. It's all just qualities and free-form creation ala SotC (or Over the Edge if you prefer). So, no Strength 12. Instead, "Sinew of Steel +1" or whatever. No Open Locks +5.

There is some pre-game delineation of what the baseline is for relevant classes and races. So, a group can say: "Elves: Good with bows, good in forests, finding secret doors." Whatever. So, a character can select as one of their qualities Elf +5. Now, in game, when he wants to fire his bow or find a secret door, he can add his Elf +5 bonus. This is also how I'm dealing with magic (or psionics or superpowers). A player chooses something for his character, let's say pyromancy. There is pre-game delineation of what pyromancy entails: damage a small group and moderate range and otherwise do fire-related magics. So, let's say the character has Pyromancy +5. His wizard faces off against 3 orcs at 50 feet, i.e., a small group at moderate range. That's right in the baseline, so T10, i.e., Target 10, i.e., DC10.  He rolls and adds his relevant modifiers including Pyromancy +5. If he beats the target, the spell succeeds and does damage equal to the spread. But you can see, from these examples, how you can re-create races and classes as, in my case, a collection of modifiers or, more accurately, as a collection of tests the modifier would apply to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127351/#Comment_127351" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-18T16:04:44+00:00" title="February 18, 2008  4:04PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan, what are you planning to do with equipment in this system, specifically magic items? <br/><br/>One of the lamest things about d20 is how much of a character's power comes from all the magical crap he hauls around.
