They are fiddling with abstact resources (Parameters, Conditions) with fiction tags (Armed, Willing) slapped on them. This actually sounds like every RPG ever, but in RT it's especially pronounced, as all Conditions and Parameters are mechanically alike. The players decide what Conditions/Parameter scores they remove and what they add, the system doesn't influence that. So you can freely associate any fiction you want with mechanics, but it doesn't matter mechanically. I guess this is true in many RPGs, but in RT it's somehow very pronounced.  <br/><br/>To really generate evocative fiction the conditions/parameters should be powerful or concrete enough to be memorable: you can easily forget you are Coerced or Supported, but you don't forget you are In Jail or Own a Helicarrier. They should also limit each other, besides the fiction: if you're Burned Out, it shouldn't be possible to tag you Enthused too. Of course you can just think what makes sense, but this is exactly the sort of stuff the system could be doing for us. <br/><br/>Also, I'm not sure how much RT is supposed to be a cyberpunk game. Factions and Identities are totally cyberpunk, but the game doesn't really deal with stuff like hacking, cyberware, rock or subcultures. RT doesn't stress the cyberpunk angle, so I can't really fault the system for overlooking many aspects of the genre. I just wouldn't consider this a definitive cyberpunk game any more than CP2013/2020 or Technoir.<br/><br/>Maybe it's that I just don't get how to play it right. A lot of people seem to have fun with it. Maybe the system is just supposed to generate story seeds: perhaps it's not supposed to limit you, but just give you ideas. But why to have a fiddly exchange system that influences the fiction preciously little for all its complexity?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382997/#Comment_382997" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-21T13:47:23+00:00" title="June 21, 2012  1:47PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I meant to use it to play either a cyberpunk or a low-fantasy war-among-thieves kind of story.

This makes sense in fast-and-loose games where straightforward fun is the main objective, but makes it harder to really dig into the fiction and feel like the game is supporting you in that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383003/#Comment_383003" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-21T14:26:05+00:00" title="June 21, 2012  2:26PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I realize it sounds like I am complaining about the system.

With two players it was fun, but exhausting since you're always 'on'.<br/><br/>Some people in our game were sceptical of the GM-less nature and how we'd get a story emerge spontaneously without a GM to guide things along. We ended the first 'episode', a two-session game, with a real buzz at managing to create a really interesting story as a group. The second episiode was not nearly as successful, but I think largely because of a certain spark missing on the day.<br/><br/>I wouldn't play it every day, but it's a perfect game to pull out now and again to get a really satisfying no-prep game.

It's one of the few games where you don't play A CHARACTER, but may actually play different characters during play, which works extremely well in the game system.<br/>It's very important to remember that this is not your average geekgasm cyberpunk game, and I think Gregor makes that very clear in the book as well, both in terms of the literary references (if you skipped it, it's on page 2) and by saying it pretty directly on page 41:<br/>"...this game [is] not about \u201cteams\u201d of \u201crunners\u201d loading<br/>up on tech from \u201cMetalBookIV\u201d or Min|Maxing every damage die and<br/>+2s out of guns|gear while marking in 40 boxes of damage. Fuck no.<br/>These stories are about people, and sometimes machines that become<br/>people. They are about personal journeys, where characters seek goals,<br/>and the big questions when your stories and goals crash into each other.<br/>What harm comes from getting what you want? What badness comes<br/>from cutting a deal with a Faction?

I should have clarified that\u2026 <i>Of course</i>, with fewer player you end up with less recovery/rest/audience time, and of course that can make the game more tiring. Not really an issue in our game because of the conditions we play it under - we break episodes up into multiple very short sessions, for example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383168/#Comment_383168" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-23T10:03:10+00:00" title="June 23, 2012 10:03AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel a bit iffy about the fact that some conditions can be acquired both mechanically and fictionally (p. 33).

However, and it is important to note this, Conditions <i>are</i> essentially fictional (mechanically, all PCons are the same and all NCons are the same with a partial exception for the Injured+Dying pair). I take p. 33 to mean that <i>you shouldn't take the mechanics as a hard constraint</i> re: acquiring/removing Conditions, but rather let the fiction dictate your Conditions when you have to. In practice, though, I've rarely if ever had a moment when we <i>had</i> to just add or remove a condition and couldn't instead just roll with what we had (let's take we're taking those as "soft constraints", or strong suggestions).<br/>In other words, <i>Conditions are supposed to be a way to mechanize your fictional circumstances</i>, rather than just a nugget of fiction tacked to a mechanical currency. Thus, when we talk about acquiring/removing conditions as an Outcome of conflict, that's just short for saying that you can change the fictional circumstances as an outcome of conflict, as well as a method for quantifying that change as discrete units.<br/>A way to get a feel for it, IMO, is: when declaring Intents for a conflict, always start with concrete fictional stakes ("breaking out of jail", "shooting down the helicopter", "extracting the crack code from Mr. Harker's brain", "joining the Ladybug's gang", etc.), <i>then</i> (also before rolling dice) consider whether and how you can "translate" those intents to mechanical changes: adding or removing a condition, checking or unchecking a Goal box, altering a Parameter\u2026 99% you can, I say, and pretty comfortably too. For additional Outcomes you can just "grab stuff", but try not to be lazy and think fiction-first instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
