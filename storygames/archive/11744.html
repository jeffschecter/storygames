Players: Our first session had too many (five) players. I was flailing with understanding the rules, and there was a lack of screentime for several players. So two players voluntarily walked the plank, and a third canceled at the last minute. So we ended up with an MC and two players, which felt pretty good. Feels like 2-3 players + MC would be the sweet spot for me.<br/><br/>2. Rolls: The understanding that 7-9 was not a "whiff", but rather a "yes, but..." was a pretty big change for our group. Having said that, they rolled a lot of misses, which was pretty funny. In several of those failure cases, I had the other player give ideas of how badly things turned out. And of course they came up with terrible things that I had not even thought of! Also, the players noted that the failure states seemed less punative when coming from another player, which I found interesting.<br/><br/>3. Moves: As has been discussed at length in <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11502&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">these</a> <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11668&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">posts</a>, there was quite a disconnect for me last session about how the Moves were suppose to work in practice. And it wasn't clear to me that the Basic Moves were simply a template to creating your own Moves for each situation. So this session I tried to take things a lot slower, and come up with Moves that in many cases were either custom, or tweaks from existing Moves. I also tried to get buy-in from the players. As in "I'm thinking XX. Does that sound cool to you?" before they actually roll the dice.<br/><br/>Some example Moves I used were:<br/><br/>Cullen was trying to start Marlene's car (which was missing a wheel after a mine explosion) and drive it away before all of the scavengers showed up and started picking parts off.<br/><br/>Cullen is concerned that the scavengers are going to get to Marlene's car before she does. So she tries to hotwire Jackabacka's 4-wheel ATV, who is having none of that. And he doesn't want to be bothered to drive Cullen out there.<br/><br/>Roll + Sharp<br/><br/>10: Jackabacka gives in and drives Cullen out to the car<br/>7-9: He gives in, but wants something in return<br/>6-: F you. You can walk<br/><br/>Rolls an 8, and Jackabacka drives Cullen out there, in exchange for a BJ and (ironically) cleaning out the fuel line in Jackabacka's ATV.<br/><br/>=<br/><br/>Cullen is trying to start the car up and drive away before the scavengers start ripping everything off they can carry.<br/><br/>Roll + Cool<br/><br/>10+: You get it started and drive away<br/>7-9: The car starts up but keeps stalling<br/>6-: something bad<br/><br/>Missed the roll, so we described her trying desperately to get the car moving while her Skull Town neighbors were swarming over the car, breaking off side mirrors and bumpers, and trying to strip off the remaining wheels.<br/><br/>=<br/><br/>Barbarossa is sitting on Hugo's old bike, with two bodies draped over the gas tank. One was just shot in the head from someone in the pickup truck, which is blocking his path back to Skull Town. Barbarossa responded by blowing Brain's head off with a magnum. Which just ticked off the gang who is now gunning the engine and trying to run Barbarossa over. He responds by calmly firing a grenade into the front grill of the oncoming truck.<br/><br/>Roll + Cool<br/><br/>10+: The truck comes to a halt<br/>7-9: The truck stops, but... (maybe a glancing blow?)<br/>6-: Bad things<br/><br/>Of course he blows the roll. So the other player narrates the grill of the truck on fire as it runs Barbarossa clean over. Bodies fly every which way, and then the truck explodes. Hello, 5 Harm to everyone. Barbarossa has 3 Armor, and ends up merely wounded. Wow.<br/><br/>=<br/><br/>So remember the deal Cullen made with Jackabacka for using his ATV? Well after all the excitement, Jackabacka is back to "collect". And after Cullen does the deed, the player says "Wait, I'm having sex with him, so I'm using my special Savvyhead move 'Things Speak'" (as though they were a thing and he had rolled a 10+)<br/><br/>So I'm asked three questions about Jackabacka's penis, and I answer them.<br/><br/>-Who handled this last before me (Tum Tum, the dwarf food beggar)<br/>-What strong emotions had been most recently nearby this? (A deep longing)<br/>-What's wrong with this, and how might I fix it? (Something like syphilis; a good shot or two from an Angel)<br/><br/><br/>4. Let shit happen<br/><br/>I had better success this session not biding my options, and just having the NPCs do what I thought they might do in the situation. Sometimes they were stupid, sometimes they were deadly. Sometimes these things intersected. After seeing how powerful Gunluggers were in practice, I especially didn't hold any punches against Barbarossa.<br/><br/>Cullen ran three people over and shot a fourth with her Gyrojet pistol on her way home. Did she really think no one was going to come after her? But interestingly, the player chose to start fixing the car before herself (which I thought was awesome). And so when Tao shows up and jumps her with a toothbrush shank, Cullen already has 2 Harm, and the additional 2 Harm puts her in Shit Row with a pierced kidney and internal hemorraging.<br/><br/>Barbarossa was trying to intimidate his way past a truck full of bad dudes. A little gunplay happened, so they simply tried to run him over. He had 3 Armor, so I figured, "How bad could it get?" (see above).<br/><br/><br/>5. Countdown timer<br/><br/>I really was not a fan of this the first time we played. It felt really fiddly and I didn't know what purpose it served. So with lowered expectations, I decided to use it at the beginning of the session when the denizens of Skull Town heard all of the battling outside.<br/><br/>4:00 People are talking about the battle<br/>7:00 People are starting to gather<br/>9:00 They are leaving the compound<br/>10:00 Approaching the battle site<br/>11:00 Stealing shit<br/>12:00 Walking back<br/><br/>It was actually pretty useful for me to kick off the particular Threats for this Front. And the end time told me when it was time to stop things and move on. It helped the pacing, and I want to experiment with it more.<br/><br/>What are some ways that you all have used this tool?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262155/#Comment_262155" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-15T21:19:23+00:00" title="March 15, 2010  9:19PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">And it wasn't clear to me that the Basic Moves were simply a template to creating your own Moves for each situation.

Unless we've been playing completely wrong the Basic Moves are not templates.  They are the only things you ever do that requires a roll.  I think the latest update allows the MC to create some custom moves as part of prep, but you absolutely don't create them on the fly.  You can go aggro, sieze by force, read a situation, read a person, or seduce...that's it (unless I forgot one).  You never roll for anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nhere's Vincent from the second thread you linked to above.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">There's something weird going on with you and the basic moves! It's like you're trying to figure out what the rules for rolling are, using the basic moves as examples to learn from. They aren't! They are the rules for rolling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, don't take the character's action and try to figure out what will happen on a 10+, what on a 7-9, and what on a miss.

You only make up new Moves as an MC, because you've played the game a bunch and have decided to add a new one.  You definitely don't come up with them on the fly.  The Moves just define the things you can roll dice for, the things in the fiction that can be attempted mechanically as well as fictionally.

Like, that first example, I really don't understand why you didn't just have Cullen roll a textbook "seduce and/or manipulate" to get Jackabacka into doing what she wanted. Instead you seem to have made a custom move that looks like it more or less accomplishes exactly the same thing as the basic move... except it uses sharp instead of hot. So, yeah, huh?<br/><br/>Custom Moves are really more for the stuff that isn't covered by any of the existing moves. Keep in mind that Acting Under Fire, and to a lesser extent Seize Something By Force (especially for abstract definitions of "something" like "respect" or "escape"), are <i>really</i> conceptually broad.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262415/#Comment_262415" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T02:41:22+00:00" title="March 17, 2010  2:41AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An important thing, I think, is that custom moves are not one shot-things.

He won't be turned on by plain sexyness, you got to figure out what he likes." This is the reason why it's better to do it in advance. You prepare custom moves for certain situations and conditions.<br/><br/>Then you either switch what has to be rolled. For example roll +Hard instead of +Hot if you're trying to seduce a masochist or something. Or you specify conditions which trigger a roll, that normally wouldn't. For example, walking into Tum Tum's backyard is automatically <i>acting under fire</i> (for whatever reason, maybe he's got traps all about), even if walking in any other backyard in town obviously isn't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262436/#Comment_262436" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T06:18:12+00:00" title="March 17, 2010  6:18AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 17, 2010 7:14AM by lumpley.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread is good. Chris, right on! I'm glad it's working better for you.<br/><br/>Everybody, here's a perfectly legal custom move that an MC might write down in the home front:<br/><br/><i><b>Whenever you take action</b>, I [the MC] can tell you to roll+a stat, whichever stat seems like the best fit to me. Before you roll, I'll tell you what the possible outcomes are, maybe enlist your help in deciding them, but in general:<br/>-On a 10+, hooray for you!<br/>-On a 7-9, good enough, but not everything!<br/>-On a miss, oh no!<br/>If you were making a move, this roll supersedes it.</i><br/><br/>This custom move is a little bit meta-, a little bit extreme, but, like, only a little. If we're placing it under the bell curve, it's outside of 1 standard deviation but within 2, it's not even out in the tails. It's well-formed and its basis in acting under fire is rock-solid. As far as I'm concerned, Chris is playing legit, modified-within-tolerances by-the-book Apocalypse World.<br/><br/>(I don't expect anybody to have already learned this from the playtest doc, by the way. The custom moves chapter is the one I haven't even written yet.)<br/><br/>Now, when I play the game, this isn't the way I do it. And I wouldn't guess that, Chris, you chose to do it this way on purpose, you just happened into it. There are some serious probs with this custom move long-term, which will require care and occasionally revision down the road. It's not a game-breaker, but under some circumstances it's going to cause some long-term stress. I can go into that if anybody's interested, it's a pretty technical discussion. So you might - only might! - want to wean yourself back exclusively onto the basic moves for basic action. I suggest that you feel your way forward with that in mind as a possibility.<br/><br/>So Chris, no bummer!

It's no shock at all that you're enjoying it, you could do a lot worse.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262440/#Comment_262440" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T06:26:34+00:00" title="March 17, 2010  6:26AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd be interested in that discussion V.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262442/#Comment_262442" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T07:10:14+00:00" title="March 17, 2010  7:10AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 17, 2010 7:11AM by lumpley.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool!<br/><br/>That custom move makes a bunch of character moves potentially-obsolete, thus flattening the, like, color contrast in the game. It's like if everyone started play with most of the "when you x, roll+y instead of rolling+z" moves -- now all the characters are mechanically more interchangeable, less differentiated by color. Move choices will matter less, stat choices, improvement choices...<br/><br/>Furthermore, sometime down the road, somebody in Chris's group is going to say "hold on a sec, she gets to roll+sharp to seduce the guy? I had to buy that ability at character creation, but she gets to do it for free? What's up with that?" This custom move makes chumps of the players who've chosen those moves legitimately.<br/><br/>It's a problem that'll take some time and some breadth of play to develop. He's playing with only a small number of players. If they also play for only a relatively short time, so they don't really <i>explore</i> the range of character moves, then it might never develop for them. Or maybe they'll decide that play is good enough without the color contrast and play this way happily for 50 sessions, I don't know. It worked for Over the Edge!<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262465/#Comment_262465" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T08:35:19+00:00" title="March 17, 2010  8:35AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the explanation and the caution, Vincent. I feel like Dad just came home and said that, yes, it was cool for junior to play with matches in the backyard;)<br/><br/>I think those custom moves in our session came out of equal parts experimentation and frustration. As for the stats, for the most part I was ignoring the char sheets and thinking aloud with the players, "what really *feels* right, here? Cool? Sharp?" \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lumpley</cite>Furthermore, sometime down the road, somebody in Chris's group is going to say "hold on a sec, she gets to roll+sharp to seduce the guy?

I'd love to see something about that in your custom moves chapter.<br/><br/>We were definitely using basic moves when it made sense in this second session. I think with more experience, we could eventually change the ratio from 60/40 custom/basic to 20/80.<br/><br/>And there's some stuff we haven't even touched yet. Like WTH happens when someone opens their mind to the psychic shithole? We've had so much head-splatting and car run-overing in the first two sessions, that I'm looking forward to some subtle mind-fucks and social awkwardness in the next session. I mean, both characters each killed four people from their own compound last session, by accident or by design. How is that going to play out in the weird social strata that is Skull Town?<br/><br/>It feels like we are peeling away another layer of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262479/#Comment_262479" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T09:24:45+00:00" title="March 17, 2010  9:24AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
