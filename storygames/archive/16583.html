I play Dungeon World and Storming the Wizard's Tower, but it's not the same sort of thing, as it turns out.<br/><br/>Some of the fun of the game came from the outstanding players and GM, of course, and some from the Nordic-death-metal-themed dungeon (<a href="http://www.lotfp.com/RPG/products/hammers-of-the-god" rel="nofollow">"Hammers of the God"</a>), which was filled with corpses and blood and assorted creepy shit. But a lot of the fun came from <b>the constant threat of death</b>.<br/><br/>The game was straight from the books - ability scores rolled in order (no adjustments), roll for hit point and take what you get, 1st level characters with one spell each. Our entire party only had one character with an ability score above 13.  My character had 2 hit points, a club and one healing spell. She was totally unsuited for dungeon adventuring. A single blow had the chance to take her out.<br/><br/>Which turned out to be super fun. Because all the creepy shit in the dungeon really felt <b>dangerous</b>. A pair of zombie dwarves? Ahh, get out of here! They're gonna KILL US! Just like in Robert Howard and Fritz Leiber books. If a couple zombies come at you, you run. But in most later editions of D&amp;D, if a couple zombies come at you, it's a minor irritant. <br/><br/>Also, my character died. I can't remember how. Zombie dwarf, maybe.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379601/#Comment_379601" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T20:16:03+00:00" title="May 23, 2012  8:16PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I like about the threat of death, coupled with largely drama-based resolution, is how it makes people very invested in minute details of the fiction.<br/><br/>We had a great sequence in play with the thief investigating a doorhandle in Tower of the Stargazer. The handle was carved like a snake, and on investigation, he noticed that there were minute holes in the ends of the snake's fangs, which were slightly stained. A poison delivery system! He took a spool of wire from his thief kit, and carefully plugged the holes with a length of wire. Then when the door knob came alive to try biting him, it was harmless!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379602/#Comment_379602" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T20:20:14+00:00" title="May 23, 2012  8:20PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>What I like about the threat of death, coupled with largely drama-based resolution, is how it makes people very invested in minute details of the fiction.</blockquote>\nYeah, I'll buy that. In the dungeon in question, there was all this mysterious backstory business with dead dwarves and bas-reliefs on the walls. I didn't care in a "story" sense, but I cared because I wanted my character to gain some sort of way out of her imminent doom.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what you mean by "drama-based resolution" though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379604/#Comment_379604" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T20:45:34+00:00" title="May 23, 2012  8:45PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2012 8:47PM by nemomeme.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>What I like about the threat of death, coupled with largely drama-based resolution, is how it makes people very invested in minute details of the fiction.</blockquote>This.  It's a completely different dynamic than just sort of floating along and counting on your character's high Perception skill to see you through.<br/><br/>You were talking about the new Doritos flavor when the DM described the sacrificial altar?  Bad idea...<br/><br/>LotFP is a fun game.  In a similar vein, the beginning of our Dungeon Crawl Classics campaign had fifteen characters enter the first dungeon and only six leave.  A single hit meant almost certain death to any given character.<br/><br/>As something of a grognard, I'm well familiar with this style of play but hadn't revisited it much until recent years.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379605/#Comment_379605" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T20:53:24+00:00" title="May 23, 2012  8:53PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Drama based resolution" means that, for example, if you describe your character doing something, and there's no question in the fiction whether it'd work, it works. The whole interaction with the doorknob didn't use dice at all, it was all description and reaction. We use some "Karma" (these are old-fashioned theory terms) as well. The reason the character could do all this stuff without a roll is that he's a thief. A fighter, for example, couldn't have done that at all, at least not without rolling some dice.<br/><br/>I totally get you about the backstroy thing. There's this fascinating thing that happens where every detail of the fiction, including seemingly superfluous decorations and backstory and such becomes part of the strategic landscape, and thus vitally important to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379608/#Comment_379608" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T21:09:13+00:00" title="May 23, 2012  9:09PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been jonesing for some Old School fun for a while, but can't find a system that doesn't make my eyes bleed.

It's super easy. If you don't like d20s, use 3d6. The core of the game isn't the specifics of what dice you're rolling anyway. I can send you the ultra-simple hack I did for myself which could use 3d6 instead of d20 no problem, but really there's nothing to it.<br/><br/>You gotta keep 3d6 in-order for stats, because there's a fetishistic, macho man quality about it that is just great. I use lots of d20 roll-under ability rolls, but that's just a personal style thing. You don't need it. Maybe a way of figuring out hits in combat. 3d6, roll under 10 + AC? Why not! Fixed or variable damage, your choice.<br/><br/>Honestly, you need barely anything else. You could work out some class differences for fun and to broaden the strategic options, if you like. I have fighters who can actually survive fights, thieves who give some surety to clever-dick trickery, and scholars to facilitate funnelling information to the players. The classes don't need to be "balanced" and in fact it's better if they're not, so long as they have distinct tactical roles.<br/><br/>The trick is to download some great modules to get you in the right frame of mind, cultivate the right attitude in yourself and amongst players, and then don't chicken out the first time someone's beloved character dies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379610/#Comment_379610" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T22:27:18+00:00" title="May 23, 2012 10:27PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>not even a retro clone but actual OGL.</blockquote>\nAll the retro-clones are OGL!

The ideas about having characters at all three levels, which we're just starting to explore, are also responses to this situation; you can play the adventurers to experience the thrills of fragile mayflies, while the kings carry the narrative weight and have character sheets and domain holdings elaborate enough that you don't want to roll one up anew every session as I did for a whole year of first-level B/X play.<br/>\n<br/>\nAD&amp;D;'s rules about losing a point of constitution and having to make system shock rolls to survive resurrection are, likewise, coming from a point where people had been playing long enough to make it desirable to re-introduce the threat of death into D&amp;D.; The OD&amp;D; "will withstand adversity" can be read as implying what AD&amp;D; takes it to mean, but it doesn't have to. The biggest surprise for me in Michael Mornard's game, and the way in which playing with one of the originals is unlike the way we play in the OSR, is that death has little sting. My character hasn't died yet, but is carrying three separate geases from when we've brought party members to be raised, and even the henchmen expect that we will bring them back from death.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379705/#Comment_379705" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-24T19:04:49+00:00" title="May 24, 2012  7:04PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Are there any Old-School-Playstyle, Feels-like-OD&amp;D games that use a system that isn't 1d20 based?</blockquote>\nWhat about Tunnels &amp; Trolls?

We each had three characters: a 3rd level PC and two 1st level henchmen. I had a henchman with 1 hp who nonetheless kept throwing himself into the fight, only to get knocked down to death's door again and again. I cast cure light wounds, another player used bandages on him, and just when I thought he was down for the count, someone else had some healing herbs that brought him back. But he had lost an ear and suffered some brain damage, so he was never going to be the same dwarf. Rolling for the consequences of severe damage was really engaging, for some reason, and the whole process gave me a sort of protective investment in and sympathy for the character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379728/#Comment_379728" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-25T05:07:57+00:00" title="May 25, 2012  5:07AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>We each had three characters: a 3rd level PC and two 1st level henchmen. </blockquote>\nWe did this in Clinton's LotFP game too.

The differences in LotFP are pretty minor, like anybody can wear armour, XP is based on silver pieces, there's more spells and they are weird, turn undead is a spell, whatever. It's one DM's house rules bolted onto B/X so it works for his adventures. Except they run fine with B/X as well, if you don't care about those changes.<br><br>I was listening to <a href="http://podgecast.com/archives/tpc-193-neoclassical-geek-revival" rel="nofollow">The Podge Cast</a> this morning and one of the hosts made the very good point that changes that look subtle in the rules, and don't really affect one-shot first-level play, can go on to have profound effects on campaigns and settings. The two specific things he mentioned were that in LotFP only fighters get attack bonuses with levels, and the lack of high powered offensive magic spells. You play out those two things to medium and high levels, and you are definitely not in Greyhawk anymore.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380343/#Comment_380343" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-31T11:23:10+00:00" title="May 31, 2012 11:23AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes.
