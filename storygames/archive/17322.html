I'm aware that there is software (e.g. catch your hare) which will allow online roleplayers to roll dice in an uncheatable way, where everyone can see what's rolled.<br/><br/>But my game uses playing cards. Players draw three cards, play one; GM draws one and plays it. Does anyone know of something like catch your hare for playing cards?<br/><br/>If necessary I'll just let everyone draw their own cards and/or draw for them. But I'd prefer a snazzy online solution, 'cause it's a snazzy online game!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlexMayo" title="AlexMayo"><img alt="AlexMayo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlexMayo">AlexMayo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392613/#Comment_392613" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-07T08:03:43+00:00" title="October  7, 2012  8:03AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2012 8:03AM by AlexMayo.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been looking for something like this for the better part of a year now.

So far I'm not having a huge amount of luck with most of these, for a mixture of compatibility reasons and lack of sufficient help files to work out how to get started. So far anywhereboardgames is working the best for me; Harlequin, as someone who has used it before can you tell me how to add jokers, and how to deal cards so only one person can see them? At the moment I have a deck of cards which I can deal cards out from face up or face down, but no option to make them visible to just one person.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394181/#Comment_394181" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-21T09:52:44+00:00" title="October 21, 2012  9:52AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So what I did was "clone" a card... any card.  Then I found an image online of a joker.<br/>When you click on the cloned cards, you can change their "face" to the url of the joker.<br/>The down-side is, you will also have to mess with the "width" of the card to scale it appropriately.  90 seemed to work okay for me.<br/><br/>To keep cards hidden, you have to create a new image onto the screen.  When you edit that, you can check a box to allow players to use this as a screen.<br/><br/>So once a player decides which one they want to hide their cards behind, they can left click on it, and the bottom of the option list should be something like "use as screen."<br/><br/>Then they should "lock" the image.  This prevents other players from clicking through it, or "accidentally" moving it.<br/><br/>After that, anyone (you included) may "deal" them cards, face down, by sliding them under the screen.  Then the player can do whatever they want with them behind the screen, and just slide them back out when they're ready to reveal.<br/><br/>You can see more of what I mean in the second post <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17382/we-played-god-king#Item_2" rel="nofollow">here</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rabalias" title="rabalias"><img alt="rabalias" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://en.gravatar.com/userimage/13975177/05fabf2f530a5a081b62b0cf469c7a48.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rabalias">rabalias</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396897/#Comment_396897" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-09T03:16:53+00:00" title="November  9, 2012  3:16AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, so just to say, I used anywhereboardgames for my game at Indie+ last weekend, which was very succesful. I'd recommend it to anyone else who is looking for a way to play online if you need more than just virtual dice. Thanks very much to all those who suggested it and particularly Harlequin for your help getting it set up, which was invaluable.<br/><br/>I wrote my experience up here if anyone is interested:<br/><a href="http://blackarmada.com/roleplaying-over-the-internets/" rel="nofollow">http://blackarmada.com/roleplaying-over-the-internets/</a><br/><br/>My only real complaint was that I couldn't for the life of me figure out how the transparency on the cards' rounded edges worked, which meant I couldn't create any new shapes - I just had to edit the ones which were available. Every time I tried to create a new shape, the transparency would break and I'd end up with a square/rectangular image.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
