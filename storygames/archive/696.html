                    After some recent discussions, I think that a simple reference for the idea of views might be beneficial. While they stem from PCon3, views don't require quite as much complexity to use on their own.<br/><br/>Views describe what part of play a player is paying attention to. They are a criteria under which the player selects or ignores the content of play.  For example, one player may have a view which focuses on the imagined events surrounding a particular character. Another may have a view that focuses on the emotional content of everything occurring during play (imagined or otherwise). The later player is unlikely to attend to the decisions of that particular character unless they influence the emotional content, likewise emotional content outside of the particular character are not relevant to the former player. Neither player has a complete picture, but each is using their own view of it.<br/><br/>Identifying views is itself an exercise, observing players and seeing what events or information elicits a response, and building a hypothesis of their views. Indeed, searching for views during play is another view as well. But views are useful for more than describing an individual player, for several reasons.<br/><br/>First, views not only limit what a player will attend to, but also limit what that player can derive enjoyment from. The litmus test I've developed for gauging the potential enjoyment of a view is one of complexity. If a view only provides random information, then continued observation will likely be frustrating. Likewise, extremely structured information is equally uninteresting. Our minds crave the discovery of patterns, we find ourselves frustrated by simplicity as much as the absence of patterns entirely.<br/><br/>What this means is that an intermediate complexity, neither random nor simple is what is sought in a particular view. This implies that a player will attempt to drive play towards that intermediate complexity. The character focused player wants the character to experience different things, but also for the character's specifics to influence those events (to induce a pattern and avoid randomness). Likewise, the emotional player does not want random emotion or constant emotion, instead he or she wants the emotions of play to have some deeper structure or meaning. If we want to make play worthwhile, we could do far worse than ensuring that these patterns exist in each player's view.<br/><br/>The second application for views is the fact that views do change, but typically views evolve slowly. Very rarely will a player change their view drastically. However, if there is a pattern on one part of a players view, and it extend beyond it, that player's view may expand to include more of that pattern. Likewise, if a portion of a player's view is not producing patterns, it will tend to atrophy and may eventually be removed. This is a gradual process, but can be done quite purposefully when you can pick out the views involved.<br/><br/>For example, the character focused player would likely change their view somewhat to include the nature of his or her character's relationships with other significant characters. Over time, this might bring the character player closer in line with the emotion player, who may focus on the fictional emotions of those same characters.<br/><br/>It is important to realize that views should rarely come to full alignment, as this will tend to remove the uncertainty inherent in differing views, and risks overly simplifying the patterns in the shared view.<br/><br/>Now there is quite a bit more to PCon3, and even just views, (which should be available once I get to writing some essays) but the basic idea of views is one of the most immediately understandable pieces, as well as one of the most powerful. <br/><br/>  - Mendel<br/><br/><a href="http://darklordforhire.livejournal.com/8607.html" rel="nofollow">RPGs should not aspire to be art or fiction, they should aspire to transcend such things.</a> </div>

<br/>
Interesting thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Question: does this allow for/recognize the same player locking into different views depending on the game being played, or even, depending on who that player is playing with and what the other players' views are?<br/>

                            When context changes significantly, that is one of the situations where views can change drastically. You might have a game or a group which inspires a radically different view from what you would otherwise adopt during a RPG. In a way, significant changes in views links into ritualization, where a definite separation can encourage a change of views. Certainly our views before or after a game will not typically be the same as our views during game. <br/><br/>On the other hand, changing views based on the views of other players is not nearly as simple. Even our own views tend to be difficult to determine as we play, and the views of others are even more so. But it is exactly this adjustment that enables the most effective play. To really examine that question involves looking at something I've termed as play controls, which are the strategies and algorithms by which we can model players adding content or adjusting their views. I hope to get into more detail of that later.<br/><br/> - Mendel<br/><br/><a href="http://darklordforhire.livejournal.com/8607.html" rel="nofollow">RPGs should not aspire to be art or fiction, they should aspire to transcend such things.</a> </div>

                            Mendel,<br/><br/>Is all this view talk a reiteration of private mind arguments in language and philosophy, or are you talking about something different?  It seems like you're saying "No one thinks exactly the way you do, but there's a cool congruence where your thoughts overlap".  And that's fine, but I was wondering whether you're just taking that idea and applying it to roleplaying (which is cool), or whether you're getting at something else and I'm missing it...<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Thomas,<br/><br/>Private language arguements don't really apply. The "unknowability" is a softer one. You cannot be certain what is being attended, but you can begin to build an understanding of a view by observing what content does and does not cause a response. Likewise, you have trouble being sure what is outside your attention, simply because you are not paying attention to it. <br/><br/>Views are filters, that remove everything which is not attended by a player. Controls is where we start talking about modeling thoughts, and even then, the specific thoughts need not be shared, even the means by which the view is implemented in the player's mind. The private aspects are bypassed in order to focus on observable and testable properties of play. We don't need to know why a player reponds predominantly to emotional content, only that this trend can be observed from watching him or her play.<br/><br/>As far as congruence, the neat thing is that you want views to align only partially, which prevents stagnation and encourages patterns. To link back to a Big Model perspective, you need a little coherence and a little incoherence in order to get fun.<br/><br/> - Mendel<br/><br/><a href="http://darklordforhire.livejournal.com/8607.html" rel="nofollow">RPGs should not aspire to be art or fiction, they should aspire to transcend such things.</a> </div>

                            It sounds to me like an argument about attention, and how individuals choose which story elements are actually integrated into their own vision of the overall arc of the story.<br/><br/>I had a really good example of this with my "Rocking Gaming Moment" post, where I was talking it over with my play partner after I posted.  I described to him the whole scene, and why I thought it rated a Rocking Gaming Moment post.  He looked at me in shock.  "You left out the whole thing about it being a site sacred to Vulcan," he said.  "The whole heritage-of-the-ancients thing is so important to me in Ars in general, and particularly in the Christianity-vs.-old-gods aspect of this game."  At which point I boggled and said, "I had no idea those things were in the story that you were telling, and I skipped the Vulcan thing because, well, I forgot about it.  It just didn't seem important."  Then he started in on listing prior plot elements that he was weaving together into this totally different story than the one that I thought I was telling.<br/><br/>Man, that's why I think role-playing is cool.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>--Jess<br/><br/>PS: Hey Mendel, am I reading you right?                        </div>

                            Mendel,<br/><br/>I think I'm having trouble parsing out how this is anything specific to roleplaying.  Is it supposed to be?  I mean, it seems like you're edging around linguistic uncertainty theories and stuff, which are totally cool.  SInce those theories are about how we interact, and roleplaying involves interaction, they're definitely applicable.<br/><br/>But I get the impression that you're talking about something different, or at least more specific, and I don't think I'm getting it.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Actually, this seems immensely practical to me in terms of 'designing fun.'  Knowing what's important to a particular player, and what they'll pick up on, follow up on, and remember about the game, is a really good way for you (as GM, fellow player, game designer) to be able to throw them things that will help them play.  If there had been a way for me to realize that Chris was developing a pattern/view around "religious conflicts across generations" then I could have thrown him more stuff regarding that - just as now that he knows that I'm really focused on the whole demon story, he's going to throw me more demon conflicts, and we can look for ways in which our two views of the world of the story can coincide and support each other.<br/><br/>I imagine the game as a rough surface with a very bright light shining on it - and we're all standing at different points around it, so different points seem illuminated for each of us, making different patterns.  Different events and aspects of those events will have different meanings for different people.  If we can find out what those meanings are, and what patterns individuals are building, then maybe we can develop techniques of how to make those patterns interact in an interesting way.  I suspect many of us are already doing this by gut instinct, and Keys are a good way to indicate this, but I think the development of meaning out of game events goes way beyond that.<br/><br/>I may be totally misunderstanding Mendel, but I've gotten something really useful out of this, so I'm arbitrarily deciding that I make sense.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>--Jess<br/><br/>PS: On patterns and fun, I recommend Raph Koster's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1932111972/" rel="nofollow">A Theory of Fun</a>.                        </div>

                            Jess,<br/><br/>You seem to be spot on with the idea of views. Especially with your spotlight analogy. One clarification though is that the "surface" of the game is more than just the story, and views can extend to include such content. Indeed, that is what happens when you extend your view to identify and include the views of other players. <br/><br/>Additionally, moving beyond the static, views are also what drives the strategies of players as they seek patterns. One good example of such a strategy is the Nash Equilibrium-style situation where you and Chris recognize and feed each other's views. Play controls, which is my term for these strategies, can become even more complex if you consider that views can also change as a result of these strategies.<br/><br/>As far as Koster's book, I've read his earlier presentation by the same name. He relates some of the same ideas I'm working with, but he doesn't appear to be taking them very far. On the subject of game design, I ought to post a summary of  what I've called induction, the process by which peripheral content, such as game texts, manifests as patterns during play.<br/><br/><br/>Thomas,<br/><br/>Views and PCon3 in general are not specific to RPGs. Rather, they are what you might call native theory to RPGs. Views are relevant in any situation where multiple people influence common content and there is no strong external criteria for outcomes. RPGs are especially good examples of these situations, and views were intented to explain them predominantly. But this does not mean that views cannot be applied elsewhere.<br/><br/>  - Mendel<br/><br/><a href="http://darklordforhire.livejournal.com/8607.html" rel="nofollow">RPGs should not aspire to be art or fiction, they should aspire to transcend such things.</a> </div>

                            Thomas, <br/><br/>The last time I introduced views I had an entire scheme set up in terms of atomic views and ways to combine views. It made a regular language, with serial views, composed views, and even a kleene star operation. If recollection serves that was one of my last posts in the Forge RPG Theory forum. <br/><br/>Since then, I've reconsidered if the structure of that language is a sacred cow that could do with some slaughtering. I'm still debating that, but there seems to be clear types of patterns, and it is worthwhile to speak of classes of these. <br/><br/>For example, you could consider views of random walks, where the step-by-step continuity is the pattern viewed. Likewise, you could consider the repeated test pattern, where the view focuses on differing inputs and outputs of a cyclic procedure. The later could apply to social or geographical exploration, while the later to learning any sort of procedure. <br/><br/>But in general, I don't believe that a classification system is as useful as a proper language of views. In either case you can specify general groupings of views, but in the later you can do so without sacrificing greater levels of detail. In short, classification systems end up being nested, forcing the creation of more and more terms, while a language presents a logic to build terms at any depth. <br/><br/>  - Mendel<br/><br/><a href="http://darklordforhire.livejournal.com/8607.html" rel="nofollow">RPGs should not aspire to be art or fiction, they should aspire to transcend such things.</a> </div>

<code>any situation where multiple people influence common content and there is no strong external criteria for outcomes</code><br/><br/>Ohhhh ... hot.  I am totally stealing that formulation.  (Well, I guess since I will I cite you it doesn't count as stealing, but I am stealing it IN MY MIND and hoarding it like winter nuts.)<br/><br/>Yeah, I kind of think Raph's work is smart but .... it leaves me hanging a little bit.  I kind of want to say, "Yeah?  And then what?" about every other page.<br/><br/>Also, more on play controls please?  I think the idea of trying to classify types of views might be useful, but actually some description of the ways that people can negotiate with each other regarding their views might be much more useful (at least to me).<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            Mendel, I'm glad Jess is getting something out of this because I'm finding it horribly opaque.  I don't know how much of that is the subject and how much of that is your writing style.  In fact, I read your initial post exactly like Thomas.  It seemed like you were just saying "people have different preferences/reactions and these preferences/reactions are sometimes in alignment and sometimes not."  I'm glad people coaxed a further explanation out of you, but I still feel like I'm missing something.<br/>
<br/>
What you're saying sounds a little like the reading I've been doing in communications theory, especially small group organizational communications and the formation of communities of practice, but it seems much more focused on the personal/player level which, I think, has been the traditional focus of most traditional roleplaying advice, including GNS.  And, honestly, I feel like this approach to roleplaying communications is misguided.  We end up trying to satisfy/understand the individual needs/preferences at the expense of creating a truly fuctional and supportive community.<br/>
<br/>
Like Thomas, I'm trying to figure out how this "views" stuff is differerent than any other meta-perspective on inter-player relations in roleplaying and what new tools it possibly offers us.  Right now, I'm not really seeing anything.  Is there a way you can link to this PCon3 stuff (or explain what that is, at least) so we can get a better sense of where this is coming from?  Because right now it just looks like a different way of saying the same thing, which is fine, but I'm having trouble seeing what we learn from saying things this way.                        </div>

                            Jess,<br/><br/>I'm glad that formulation makes sense to you. As far as play controls, I've worked out some things. Basically play controls seem to incorporate something like an algorithmic bricolage, where players seek the most available content to accent or add in order to maintain patterns within their views. <br/><br/>A player can find this content by extending or contradicting the active content currently in play. (What if she had two body guards too? - That doesn't make sense.) Or the player can re-introduce content from the history of play. (Are these the thugs from last time? - Give Julie a chance, she hasn't gotten to do much this session.) Or the player can pull in "new" content from something related but not engaged. (So the swimming rules say that we need to roll this. - The messenger is actually the empress' daughter, hiding as a young boy. - Don't pressure him so much, he's had a long day at work.)<br/><br/>Play controls seek patterns as well, looking for exchanges and restrictions which can inform the choice of content. Once you realize that another player will always reject real-world religious content, then your play controls will adapt around that, possible even eliminating that content from your view. Particular exchanges, such as offering a core idea, and letting others add to it, can be powerful tools, once they become established. <br/><br/>These regularities in play are called play constraints, they are literally the dynamic system constraints on the interaction of all of the players. However, these are emergent properties of play, not a translation of a rule book or a specific setting. In the ideal, play constraints become more definite, play controls adapt to them, and eventually views adapt as well. <br/><br/>  - Mendel<br/><br/><a href="http://darklordforhire.livejournal.com/8607.html" rel="nofollow">RPGs should not aspire to be art or fiction, they should aspire to transcend such things.</a> </div>

                            Jonathon,<br/><br/>As far as views are concerned, they are nearly as simple as you describe. The only addition is the complexity property, where player enjoyment comes precisely from intermediate complexity within a view. What may not be apparent is that when I say that I'm actually talking about a quantifiable property which we can estimate by recording play. If you'd like I can give a short summary of complexity methods and why this is the case. <br/><br/>To have fun in play, you need to meet that complexity criteria, and you can apply views solely with that intuition. Views are looking for a particular type of pattern, the worst dysfunctions in play occur when multiple views all percieve their pattern beginning, but at some point the pattern diverges and the enthralled player is suddenly starring at static, for example because one person wants a cycle of hope and despair, while the other wants a downward spiral of heightening doom. <br/><br/>You are right that views only deal with what a single player wants. But that is mostly because they are the part of PCon3 which deals with what a single player wants. Play content, play controls, and play constraints form the rest of the theory, which attempts to model RPGs as a dynamic system fed by the players, and hopefully achieving a stable set of constraints over time. <br/><br/>My original Forge post on this can be found <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=17387.0" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It may be of use. <br/><br/>  - Mendel<br/><br/><a href="http://darklordforhire.livejournal.com/8607.html" rel="nofollow">RPGs should not aspire to be art or fiction, they should aspire to transcend such things.</a> </div>

                            Thomas,<br/><br/>Fair enough. My professional background is in mathematics, physics, and computer science, focusing in complexity and dynamical systems. I have some professional exposure in biology and biochemistry, there was a time I purified hemoglobin from human blood.

I'm currently attempting to build a similiar level knowledge in ritual and cultural studies (based on Chris Lehrich's suggesting reading from a few years ago).<br/><br/>What I've been talking about here is a theory based on my perspective of RPGs, intended to be experimental in nature.

                            Alright. I'll try a different approach and mix all three (background, PCon3-style theory, and concrete examples). I'll be posting what I hope are bite sized pieces. Here goes.<br/><br/><b>Strings</b> <br/><br/>The simplest concept for understanding complexity is the idea of strings. A string is a sequence of symbols taken from what is called an alphabet. So for example:<br/><br/>abbababbaa<br/>baababba<br/>aa<br/>(nothing)<br/><br/>are all strings. What's more all of these strings use the same alphabet containing both a and b. Not every symbol needs to show up, and the string can be as short or long as you like, what matters is that only symbols from the alphabet show up, and they are in an order.<br/><br/>Why is this important? Because we can model the active content in play as a string. Each glance, or suggestion, or roll of the dice, gets added onto the string one after another. The problem is for all practical purposes, the alphabet is unlimited. Each glance is different from the last and a character action may never have been uttered before, and may never be uttered again. <br/><br/>In the most basic sense, a view is something that takes a string, and turns it into a string from a particular limited alphabet. <br/><br/>Take a particular play example, like this <a href="http://hamsterprophet.blogspot.com/2006/05/joao-wins-death-stakes.html" rel="nofollow">one</a>. Each sentence is in a way a symbol in the play content, but a player doesn't care about every last detail, so we can replace the symbol of:<br/><br/>JMendes says "I stand up ready to face them, but there is a trail of blood..."<br/><br/>with "change of fortune" or "gory detail" or "dramatic moment", and indeed we would expect different players to replace that symbol in different ways. But the advantage of  the "gory detail" perspective is that more such details will be making an appearance. In fact, it may be Nathan's intent here to nix any endings which have too many gory details, focusing instead on clever or classy details, in which case a view that reduces to "gory details" works fine for him. <br/><br/><i>Computer Science Aside</i> <br/><br/>You can think of a view as a function mapping a symbol stream of an infinite alphabet to a symbol stream of a finite alphabet. You can think of it as two parts, first a map that takes the infinite alphabet into a finite intermediate one, and a computable function which takes input stream under that mapping and produces the final output stream.<br/><br/>For example, we have an infinite alphabet {a1, a2, ...., b1, b2, ...} which is mapped to {a,b} by any ax into a, any bx into b. And the computable function is 0 if two consecutive symbols match, 1 otherwise. Transforming a2a7a89b1a8b7b54 intermediately into aaababb and then to 001110. <br/><br/><i>End Aside</i><br/><br/>Now people don't always reduce alphabets like this, sometimes you just sit back and try to absorb everything going on around you. But if you want to respond, then you need to do so. The reason is simple, without reducing unique events or stimuli into a broader symbol, we can't recognize patterns. <br/><br/>But what is a pattern? Stay tuned for the next post.<br/><br/>  - Mendel<br/><br/><a href="http://darklordforhire.livejournal.com/8607.html" rel="nofollow">RPGs should not aspire to be art or fiction, they should aspire to transcend such things.</a> </div>

<b>Kolmogorov Complexity</b> <br/><br/>It's not as scary as it sounds, really. <br/><br/>Remember strings? Well consider a string that looks like this:<br/><br/>"repeat once" "repeat once" "add a" "add b" "end repeat" "add c" "end repeat" <br/><br/>Now this is both a string and a set of instructions on how to produce a string. This is an example of how strings can also be programs. In this case the string above tells you how to produce the following string.<br/><br/>ababcababc<br/><br/>One of the things about programs, is that they have a certain alphabet of instructions, which translate into actions, this program uses the following alphabet:<br/><br/>{"repeat", "end repeat", "add a", "add b", "add c"}<br/><br/>And using this alphabet we could make any string of a's, b's, and c's. But what if you wanted to write instructions for strings with d's or "repeat once"'s? There is a standard trick, using binary, that lets you reduce any alphabet into 1's and 0's. This is called coding, but all that's really important is that you assign a string of 1's and 0's in place of each symbol:<br/><br/>So we could replace "repeat once" with 00, "end repeat" with 01, "add a" with 10, "add b" with 110, and "add c" with 111. If we do that the program we had above looks like this:<br/><br/>0000101100111101<br/><br/>And we can do the same with the output too. <br/><br/>Now we can get back to Kolmogorov complexity. If we have a specific set of binary instructions, we can define Kolmogorov complexity for that set of instructions. If we take an input string, the Kolmogorov complexity of that string is the smallest string of intructions which will produce the input.<br/><br/>For example, using the instructions we have up above, the Kolmogorov complexity for the string abababababababababababababababab (ab repeated 16 times) is just the length of 000000001011001010101 or 21. <br/><br/>One of the problems with looking at a single instruction set is that some strings are hard to write instructions for. If we had repeated ab 15 times, then the Kolmogorov complexity would have been much larger, since we couldn't use the doubling effect of nested "repeat once"'s. We can imagine a different instruction set, perhaps one with "add ab 15 times" as an instruction which would do far better. <br/><br/>Fortunately there is a solution, it is possible to have an instruction set that can execute other instruction sets. This is the same principle by which your computer executes programs using programs. This universal instruction set gives us a general Kolmogorov complexity, which is just the minimum sized program to produce the input string.<br/><br/>Kolmogorov complexity is also called description length complexity, because these programs are the smallest complete description of the strings they produce. Casually you can estimate Kolmogorov complexity by describing instructions on how to completely produce a string. A short description means a small complexity, like a long sequence of "I attack" "I roll" "I miss". If you can't describe a sequence of symbols or events shorter than the sequence itself, then you can treat that sequence as random. Imagine if a player created dialogue by randomly picking words from the dictionary, or more reasonably from his word list in Og. You could only reproduce what he said by recording each word.<br/><br/><i>Computer Science Aside</i><br/><br/>I am glossing over the Turing machines in favor of the instruction sets. Basically, Kolmogorov complexity is the minimum input required to produce the string as output for a given universal Turing machine. By simulating universal Turning machines you can show that the difference between any two universal machines Kolmogorov complexity function is bounded by a constant, which lets us abstract out the specific universal Turing machine.<br/><br/>Also, Kolmogorov complexity is uncomputable. There's a simple diagonalization arguement which goes something like this. If it were computable, then you could use it as an instrucion in a program, which means you could write a program which produces the "lexicographically first string of Kolmogorov complexity greater than the length of this program", which produces a contradiction by producing a smaller description than the Kolmogorov complexity. <br/><br/><i>End Aside</i><br/><br/>When using Kolmogorov complexity you should always be aware that you cannot usually determine the complexity precisely. You can produce smaller descriptions, but you can't be sure that you've found the smallest one. It's always possible that there is something you've missed. In a way, Kolmogorov complexity tells you how much unique information there is in string. <br/><br/>Many applications of Kolmogorov complexity use a basic principle of information, namely that it behaves opposite to entropy. Just as entropy always increases, information always decreases. So if I have a some input string, and I have a process, which I can also describe as a string (using instructions like we did earlier), then the complexity of the output is limited by the complexity of the input and the complexity of the process. Basically you can't produce any new information that didn't come from one of them. <br/><br/>This is one of the reasons randomizing is so useful in RPGs, the output of a die roll is a high complexity string, which means even if we lose information in the process of playing the game, we still have enough information left to keep things interesting. On the other hand, in a very interactive game, the process of play and the input of the players often provides ample information, and the randomness would risk adding too much. Hence randomizers are often avoided or ignored in those play situations. <br/><br/>But but it is the patterns that are "interesting" in that information. With the idea of descriptions here, I can start loosely defining patterns. Patterns appear when Kolmogorov complexity is reduced, as the pattern lets us describe the data more succinctly. But when we play, we're not just looking for any patterns, we want patterns with some complexity, which means we want to avoid both extremes of Kolmogorov complexity, the low complexity repeatitions and the high complexity randomness. <br/><br/><i>Notes:</i><br/><br/>I apologize, there wasn't much in the way of concrete examples for this theory bite. However I promise to remedy that next time. <br/><br/>Also, Fred, views are lossy, more from the alphabet compaction, than the computable function, although both can be lossy. <br/><br/>  - Mendel<br/><br/><a href="http://darklordforhire.livejournal.com/8607.html" rel="nofollow">RPGs should not aspire to be art or fiction, they should aspire to transcend such things.</a> </div>

<b>Flow Complexity</b><br/><br/>Now think about a very simple RPG. You and a GM, where you offer an action, and the GM tells you whether your action is successfully or whether it fails. The GM has some procedure to determine whether your action succeeds or not. But the mechanics do not depend on the nature of the action. Instead success or failure is just printed out on a sheet, and the GM tells you if you succeed each time. <br/><br/>Now think about the following procedures to determine success:
<ul>
<li>Every third action fails.</li>
<li>Actions fail randomly, one third of the time.</li>
<li>Coin flips, except after an action succeeds, the next action does automatically.</li>
</ul>
<i>Game Design Aside</i><br/><br/>Success two out of three times was something I worked out a few years ago as a basic benchmark for helping players feel challenged, but largely successful. It's not very deep, but the methods used are of some interest to PCon3. In particular the development of model players for game testing and analysis. The full discussion and results are <a href="http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/columns/physics26mar03.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/><i>End Aside</i><br/><br/>Given these three procedures, which one would be the most fun? <br/><br/>Completely reliable success is engaging for a very short while. Then it will simply become repetitive, as you perform two actions you want, and one you don't over and over again.<br/><br/>Completely random success is engaging for longer, but after some time becomes problematic. The randomness keeps building, without any pattern to the actions which are successful and which fail.<br/><br/>The last one is the most fun of the three, because it balances randomness with pattern. You have some reliability that after your first success, you'll get a second one for free. At the same time, you will quickly learn when failure is possible and when it is not.  <br/><br/>Now admittedly, none of these are as fun as a more complex procedure which would require you to guess and risk your suggestions based on that guess. <br/><br/>Now we can look at this situation from the perspective of Kolmogorov complexity, by stopping the game at some point and looking at the string of successes and failures. The repetitious string has a very low Kolmogorov complexity, just three symbols repeated some number of times. The random string has a very high Kolmogorov complexity, as each symbol must be specified separately. The third string is somewhere in the middle, it has randomness, but we know that successes always happen in pairs, so we can reduce each pair into just one symbol. <br/><br/>In more quantitative terms:<br/><br/>The first string has complexity roughly equal to the logarithm of it's length, since that is how many bits we needed to store its length.<br/><br/>The second string has complexity roughly equal to its length, since we need to store all of it.<br/><br/>The third string has complexity roughly equal to its two-thirds of its length, since we can eliminate one third of the symbols. <br/><br/>Now you can see one of the problems with Kolmogorov complexity, it's almost always dependent on the length of the string. So when we try to be specific about what intermediate complexity is, we need to take the string's length into account. <br/><br/>One way to do this is to define intermediate complexity as Kolmogorov complexity significantly less than the length of the string (which indicates randomness), and significantly more than the log of that length (which indicates simple periodic patterns). It gives us a nice range, and separates the three processes we have reasonably well.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there is another problem. What if you decide you really want something closer to Kolmogorov complexity of half the length? Your GM hits upon a simple solution. He takes a sheet with process one and a sheet with process two, and half way through he switches between them. That means that your total complexity is now a little more than half of the length of play. But it's hardly any more fun than either of those processes are together. On the other hand, if he switched between the two sheets, every five to seven actions, then the Kolmogorov complexity wouldn't be that different, and the game would be far more fun.<br/><br/>The key here is the choice of when to start and stop the string is arbitrary, and it shouldn't affect the complexity, because you really want to know the complexity at each moment of play. The simplest way to do this is to take smaller and smaller strings, until the complexity doesn't change other than from the string's length changing. Think of this as the flow complexity of the string, not as a whole, but as we experience it moving from the start to finish.<br/><br/><i>Mathematics Aside</i><br/><br/>This is similar to taking the limit of the Kolmogorov complexity to find the instantaneous complexity at a given instant. The weird part comes from the fact that Kolmogorov complexity does not behave well for very small strings, since all those strings are essentially random. After all, how do you compress the string 1. This means we need to stop the limiting process before we get to that scale. <br/><br/><i>End Aside</i><br/><br/>So where do views come in? First they refine the sheer volume of information, and reduce it to a manageable number of symbols. Then they seek out patterns in those symbols. The ability to find these patterns is limited by the flow complexity. So to satisfy our view we want to ensure that we maintain intermediate flow complexity, that we don't find ourselves in the land of randomness or extreme simplicity.<br/><br/>This is the core idea of a view, but there is a little bit more. In particular when we start using views in real situations it's often useful to expand them a little further. <br/><br/><i>Notes:</i><br/><br/>Thomas, let me know if you're still unconvinced about intermediate complexity. <br/><br/>Jonathon, if you could let me know what you are understanding, it would help to refine my explanations, or offer supplementary ones.<br/><br/>  - Mendel<br/><br/><a href="http://darklordforhire.livejournal.com/8607.html" rel="nofollow">RPGs should not aspire to be art or fiction, they should aspire to transcend such things.</a> </div>

Is this a hypothesized, or studied answer?  I'm seeing that your views model suggests that intermediate complexity is ideal for human pattern-sorting, but I find myself unconvinced that this is actually the case.<br/><br/>Here's a quick recap of what I'm getting from you: we can use techniques from Kolmogorov comlexity study to analyze patter complexity in game interaction, this is interesting.  For some reason, you hypothesize that humans prefer an intermediately complext patterns over extremely complex or extremely simple patterns.<br/><br/>At the moment I'm not sure I buy your intermediate complexity hypothesis, but I'm willing to grant it to you for the purposes of discussion because I sense that it's not really the focus of the views theory anyway.  So feel free to move on, for now at least, and we can come back to it later.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Thomas,<br/><br/>We seem to be disconnected on a few matters. First, I'm talking about pattern learning, particularly as the source of fun. As intermediate flow complexity is defined, it indicates that the string is suitable for continuous pattern learning. <br/><br/>Certainly patterns are discernable in the random strings or the simple strings, but not as a flow. Eventually the randomness prevents pattern learning, and once the simple structure is learned nothing more can be acquired from the simple strings. Since a view is the input to pattern learning, to be satisfied it must produce strings of intermediate complexity, otherwise it cannot serve the purpose of a pattern learning input. That is the crux of views. <br/><br/>If you treat views as lacking that property things will become increasingly incomprehesible as I go on. Intermediate complexity is one of the foundational ideas of the theory. That being said I will continue, but we should also try to hash out this matter. It would probably help if you voiced some of your doubts specifically. That way I can pinpoint what parts you'll have to humour me on, and which I can resolve by clarifying further.<br/><br/>  - Mendel<br/><br/><a href="http://darklordforhire.livejournal.com/8607.html" rel="nofollow">RPGs should not aspire to be art or fiction, they should aspire to transcend such things.</a> </div>

                            Mendel,<br/><br/>Oh, wait a minute...  "I'm talking about pattern learning, particularly as the source of fun".  As the only source of fun, the primary source of fun, one of many sources of fun?  That's going to be important, because I'll probably fight you on the first, and might on the second, the third I agree with.<br/><br/>Once we figure out where we can agree on the above, I think I can agree that some concept like intermediate comlpexity is required in order to evaluate the fitness of patterns for this sort of fun.  However, intermediate complexity may be too complex for anything but evaluative work.  Some patterns are going to be too simple for me and too complex for my friend and just right for you.  Further, with time patterns grow more familiar and their apparent complexity is reduce.  This would seem to indicate that a pattern that is "intermediate" right now might be sipmle in two or three months of use.<br/><br/>Is that ll in line with what you're thinking?<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Thomas,<br/><br/>Pattern learning as source of fun is where we get into my axioms, so I'll get to that in a bit.<br/><br/>You identified three concerns:<br/><br/>Difficulty in evaluating intermediate complexity - I argue that the human mind is built for finding patterns, and we are fortunate because that is the difficult step in estimating complexity. In addition, all we need are estimates, and there are some computational technologies that are quite useful for that.<br/><br/>Personal levels of complexity - There does seem to be a sweet spot issue there, although some of that also depends on the views. Sometimes patterns are subsumed in the view, and only fluctuations of those patterns are attended. For example, getting into a game's rhythm and observing the subtleties instead of the coarse structure of play. <br/><br/>Growing familiarity in patterns - Much of this is the view changing to absorb the coarser patterns. <br/><br/>Now back to the axiom. I'm asserting, and I'm not claiming a proof of it, that:<br/><br/>Pattern learning is the source of all internal fun.<br/><br/>In this case internal fun is not driven directly by an outside stimuli or pressure. So both pleasant sensations and relief from anxiety are external types of fun. Internal is fun derived predominantly from your thoughts. Now from what I've seen internal fun can be broken down into aesthetic, reinforcement, and (pattern) learning. What my axiom suggests is that neither reinforcement nor aesthetic fun are needed to model internal fun. Basically we can treat those types of fun as manifestations of pattern learning. <br/><br/>This axiom is an unabashed generalization, intended to make the model tractable. I'm not asking anyone to agree with it. For the moment accept it to use the model, but I certainly don't want people to stop questioning it.<br/><br/>  - Mendel<br/><br/><a href="http://darklordforhire.livejournal.com/8607.html" rel="nofollow">RPGs should not aspire to be art or fiction, they should aspire to transcend such things.</a> </div>

                            Mendel,<br/><br/>Okay, see, that was causing me a lot of confusion.  Now that we've established it as an axiom, I think I'm on board with you.  So...<br/><br/>In the interest of full disclosure: I have severe reservations with your proposal that all internal fun (by which I assume you mean all fun, period) is the result of pattern learning.  Still, I'm willing to grant you the axiom in the interests of seeing where this is going.<br/><br/>Part of the problem is that it strikes me that the question of whether fun is due entirely to pattern learning is quite possibly an emperical one.  Since it's non-intuitive and emperical, I tend to demand that emperical proof.  Still, as I said, I'll grant  you your axiom: say on, Mendel, say on!<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

<b>Physical Views</b><br/><br/>At this point, views are pretty well defined. They take the unlimited symbols from everything happening in play and compact them to a manageable portion. And then they try to find patterns in that portion. The view is satisfied if the strings it creates have intermediate flow complexity, meaning for any given part of the string the complexity is not so high as to be random, or so low as to be redundant.<br/><br/>But there is one additional way that views can help us analyze RPGs. We've made the assumption that views are cognitive filters, that remove and focus a players attention onto a specific aspect of play. But in reality there are many things of which a player is physically unaware, as well as mentally. Whether these are conversations occurring in another room, or just the expression on a face when you are turned the other direction, it is information available to some players and not to others. <br/><br/>We can easily extend views to include physical restrictions on information. All we need do be able to split our input symbols between events which the player can perceive, and events which he or she cannot. Then we only need require the view to erase all of the unobservable symbols. <br/><br/><i>Control Theory Aside</i><br/><br/>This addition is analogous to adding unobservables in control theory. Effectively we just remove them from our language before we translate the strings. However things get much more interesting when unobservables become observables and vice versa, especially if the change is caused by a controllable event.<br/><br/><i>End Aside</i><br/><br/>Now that we've extended views to incorporate both mental and physical limitations on what players notice, a particularly important question appears. If our view excludes another player's facial expressions because we are facing in the wrong direction, then changing that view to include those expressions, and possibly exclude those of another player, is as simple as a turn of the head. Even a conversation in another room can be accessed by entering that room. <br/><br/>So on one hand, we've expanded views to accommodate widely different forms of RPGs from large live action games to compartmentalized play-by-email. However we now need to look at how views change, both for physical and mental reasons. And we shouldn't forget that players don't just observe play, they contribute to it as well. What we need is a flexible theoretical tool to describe how people modify views and contribute content, all to keep their views satisfied. <br/><br/>  - Mendel<br/><br/><a href="http://darklordforhire.livejournal.com/8607.html" rel="nofollow">RPGs should not aspire to be art or fiction, they should aspire to transcend such things.</a> </div>

                            Mendel,<br/><br/>I think I'm having some trouble with your use of the word "views".  Are you using it ambiguously, or am I misunderstanding.  You speak of views as <i>things that are</i>, as an identifier of the interpretted patterns of play, and you speak of views as <i>things to be attained</i>, as things that players try to accomplish.<br/><br/>Are these two aspects of the same thing, two different things, or one thing that i can't seem to grasp all at once?<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Thomas, as we discussed, views take the full expanse of play and narrow it to a specific piece. Satisfying a view means that this piece has intermediate flow complexity. Views need not be satisfied, but we do want to satisfy our views. <br/><br/>At this point I was going to put a bite on the relationship between ritualization and complete changes of view. In particular, describing the ritualization at the beginning of a RPG as a form of context shift, which overtly recognizes that player's views must change dramatically. Sometimes this fails, in which some players have not adjusted to game yet. Unfortunately, I am still working through Catherine Bell's <i>Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice</i>, so I can't be sure I understand ritualization well enough to use it in this context. So, I will cover this context shift at a later time. <br/><br/>Beyond that, I've pretty much finished what I set out to do for views. At somepoint soon I'll be posting a separate thread for play controls. Part of what's taking so long is I'm trying to piece together play control examples from various available actual play reports. In particular I'm currently going through the BitV play reports looking for illustrative pieces. <br/><br/>The other hurdle is that while views are fairly self-contained, the interaction of play content, play controls, and play constraints is rather essential. In particular, the constraints in play factor into the play controls that players use to affect play, and this very interaction is what causes play constrains to occur. But, I'll do what I can.<br/><br/>  - Mendel<br/><br/><a href="http://darklordforhire.livejournal.com/8607.html" rel="nofollow">RPGs should not aspire to be art or fiction, they should aspire to transcend such things.</a> </div>

                            Yes and no. <br/><br/>And the OOC stuff is part of play. It's important. Indeed, it's entirely possible for a player to have predominantly OOC views. <br/><br/>Interviews aren't really the best way to extract play controls. For one thing, people tend to be very bad at relating how available a piece of content was before they introduced it. I usually prefer to first analyze as complete a recording of the game as I can. As far as asking questions to the players, I find the best ones are retention questions. The best retained aspects of play for a given player correlate with that player's view.<br/><br/>Part of the purpose of PCon3 is to analyze play without needing the players to interpret or try to remember how their controls worked. We can look at the content contributed by a player, and see what patterns they present, which helps us narrow down the perspective of the play controls, much the same way we narrow down on a view. <br/><br/>Of note, one of the ideas that intrigues my about your play in BitV is the use of Hardcore, not as a concept, but as a play control that becomes a play constraint (by generating particular patterns in  play).<br/><br/>  - Mendel<br/><br/><a href="http://darklordforhire.livejournal.com/8607.html" rel="nofollow">RPGs should not aspire to be art or fiction, they should aspire to transcend such things.</a> </div>
