Feel free to respond here in-thread to another link posted.<br/><br/>a. If you're looking to start a conversation, perhaps take your comment and create a new thread with it in the Stuff to Watch category.<br/><br/>b. Otherwise, to prevent too many comments in the thread, number your response (first response: [1]; second response [2]; third response [3]). If you see that you're the second person to post, "Wow, that looks cool!" to a post here, then put a "[2]" at the top of your post. Three posts ([3]) is the limit: The fourth person to post should just take their comment and create a new thread, to carry the discussion over there further.<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>Because these threads are great: We can link to little things being talked about on the web in general, on blogs, or other forums that might be noteworthy, without having to dedicate a new thread to each and every one (although that, too, is fine if you want to discuss the item further or "open up a discussion").<br/><br/>Responding to these posts with a comment or two is understandable (other times there might be no comments, just because the link was self-explanatory: nothing to say, lots of heads nodding in agreement). But we don't want to create a huge discussion in the middle of the thread: Some folks get a lot out of these threads, and don't want to look back to see the "10 latest posts" just to see that it's a heated discussion of something from a previous page.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449219/#Comment_449219" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-01T08:51:13+00:00" title="November  1, 2015  8:51AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 1, 2015 8:53AM by Rafu.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sign-up is open for <a href="http://solmukohta.org/" rel="nofollow">Solmukohta 2016</a>.<br/><br/>Next year's Solmukohta (the Finland-based edition of <a href="http://nordiclarp.org/wiki/Knutepunkt" rel="nofollow">Knutepunkt</a>) will take place on March 9th-14th on-board cruise ship M/S Silja Symphony on the Helsinki-Stockholm line. This is going to be huge \u2014 and I'm terribly sad I won't be able to go this time (barring a last-minute miracle).<br/><br/>If you don't know a thing about it, Knutepunkt/Knutpunkt/Knudepunkt/Solmukohta got started (in 1997) as an off-season, out-of-character meet-up for Nordic larpers and went on to become something unique. Usually described as a "conference", it's currently a melting pot where larpers from all parts of Europe and elsewhere in the world mingle with interesting people from the outskirts of or outside larping communities, such as tabletop rpg designers, performance artists, professional interaction designers, experimental experience designers, role-playing academics, journalists\u2026 Activities there include conference-style lectures and workshops about a huge variety of topics (most of them larp-related but not all), a few games being played, masked and costumed parties, drinking (possibly too much), all-night dancing, impromptu or carefully planned communal rituals, artistic performances (from live music to fire-juggling to stand-up comedy to the screening of films) and a lot of talking interesting topics with interesting people all the time.<br/><br/>All of the above happens in an environment which is generally young, vibrant and enthusiastic, famously genderqueer-friendly (to me, it was where I started learning a few things about gender in practice) and generally open to all sorts of weird people from anywhere and their surprising ideas. EDITED TO ADD: and most KP-goers have outrageously good fashion sense!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449222/#Comment_449222" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-01T19:52:51+00:00" title="November  1, 2015  7:52PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just released: <b><a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/157229/ACTION-MOVIE-WORLD-First-Blood" rel="nofollow">ACTION MOVIE WORLD: First Blood</a></b> by Ian Williams. Features a cool two-part playbook system in which you combine a movie star character with the action hero role they're playing.\n<blockquote>This is a badass roleplaying game. Build a team of action stars and make the best cheesy movies a child of the VHS era can imagine!<br/><br/>Save the day! Stop the bad guy! Avenge your buddies! Blow Stuff Up!<br/><br/>This game is Powered by the Apocalypse. Take on the role of an action hero and star in different sorts of cheesy movies, from barbarian movies to buddy cop flicks. Watch your actor grow even as he is typecast. Hi-five your costars.<br/><br/>ACTION MOVIE WORLD: First Blood contains almost everything you need to make sure the hero wins, the villain loses, and the good movies get sequels. Just add 2d6 and some friends. Remember to rewind your cassette for the next player.</blockquote>\nIan talks about the game in more depth in <a href="http://igwilliams.blogspot.ca/2015/05/the-physical-language-of-action-movies.html" rel="nofollow">this blog post</a>. He sees the game as a way of articulating a particular thesis about the action genre, namely:  "action movies aren't about violence. They are, of course, violent. Very violent. And that violence is very front and center. But rather than being about violence, what they're actually about is physical expression of emotions."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449224/#Comment_449224" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-01T23:14:58+00:00" title="November  1, 2015 11:14PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://wormwoodtea.wordpress.com/games-galore-2015-year-of-the-whirlwind/" rel="nofollow">Games Galore 2015: Year of the Whirlwind</a> continues.<br/><br/>November's theme is The Land of Oz.
