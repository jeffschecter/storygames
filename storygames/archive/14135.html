I say "some" because it's been over a week, so I don't remember all the details, and I don't tend to write AP reports. If you played, please help me fill in the details!<br/><br/>Our group chose the Vegas playset.<br/><br/>THE CHARACTERS (AND PLAYERS)<br/>Louis (Mark)<br/><br/>*Relationship: Crime: Former cellmates<br/>*Need: To win: Win the crowd over by stealing the show<br/><br/>Big Jack Dallas (Mike)<br/><br/>*Relationship: Family: Parent &amp; Child<br/>*Object: Trouble: Business card with something scribbled on back<br/><br/>Bobby Dallas (Matthew)<br/><br/>*Relationship: Friendship: Born loser/Best friend<br/>*Location: Downtown: Scheduled-for-demolition Lady Luck Casino<br/><br/>Freddie Luck (Graham)<br/><br/>*Relationship: Business: "Partners"<br/>*Need: To get even: With those cheating bastards<br/><br/>Louis (Mark)<br/><br/><br/>ACT ONE<br/>Scene 1: At the Waffle Shop (Mark's)<br/>Louis gets processed from prison and meets Freddie at the waffle shop to pick back up where he left off - by recovering the money he stole from Freddie's casino. Freddie wants nothing to do with the man who's cost him the only thing he ever had: the Lady Luck Casino, now scheduled for demolition.<br/><br/>Scene 2: On the Phone (Mike's)<br/>Big Jack gets processed from the same prison on the same day, and phones his wayward son Bobby, to discuss plans to recover the money. Bobby has a business card with account numbers on it, but his dry-cleaning of his dad's leather jacket has lost him the final account number. Now they need to find where Louis stashed the account paperwork. Father and son agree to meet at the same waffle shop Freddie just left Louis at.<br/><br/>Scene 3: At the Waffle Shop (Matthew's)<br/>Louis sees Bobby at the waffle shop, but neither Louis nor Jack sees the other. Apparently, Louis and Bobby had or have some arrangement, as Louis signals not to give him away. Jack tells Bobby where to find the paperwork: in a bathroom stall in the soon-to-be-demolished casino.<br/><br/>Scene 4: (Graham's)<br/><br/>Scene 5: (Mark's)<br/><br/>Scene 6: (Mike's)<br/><br/>Scene 7: (Matthew's)<br/><br/>Scene 8: (Graham's)<br/><br/>THE TILT<br/><br/>*Mayhem: An out-of-control rampage<br/><br/>*Innocence: The wrong guy gets busted<br/><br/>ACT TWO<br/>Scene 1: (Mark's)<br/><br/>Scene 2: (Mike's)<br/><br/>Scene 3: (Matthew's)<br/><br/>Scene 4: (Graham's)<br/><br/>Scene 5: (Mark's)<br/><br/>Scene 6: (Mike's)<br/><br/>Scene 7: (Matthew's)<br/><br/>Scene 8: (Graham's)<br/><br/>I don't remember the specific scene breakdowns from here, but generally:<br/>*Bobby had some sort of deal with a joint task force of the Department of the Interior, Indian Affairs, and HUD, for immunity for himself and his father.<br/>*Freddie had a breakdown, tried to knock down the casino with a wrecking ball, and failed.<br/>*Freddie assaulted Louis in his hotel room, blaming him for everything that had gone wrong.<br/>*Bobby had Freddie picked up and "interrogated" by the Feds. Freddie assaulted his captors and escaped, leading to a slew of charges.<br/>*Big Jack found the account documents...right before the casino collapsed on him.<br/>*Bobby frantically tried to rescue Jack from the debris.<br/>*I don't remember the specifics of Louis' scenes, but I do remember him playing all the angles and everyone against each other.<br/><br/>If you played, please help me out with details and order of scenes!<br/><br/>AFTERMATH<br/>Louis: Sent to minimum-security prison again, Louis becomes a guru for would-be accounting fraudsters. He may be incarcerated, but he's living the good life.<br/><br/>Big Jack Dallas: In the hospital recovery from being buried under the collapsing casino, Jack's fortunes are looking up when "old friends" show up and, not finding the money they expected, "adjust" his morphine drip.<br/><br/>Bobby Dallas: Selling out the Feds looked to get Bobby and Jack off the hook, but that goes south after Bobby returns to father's bedside just after his "old friends" leave. Last seen losing at dollar slots in one of the big casinos.<br/><br/>Freddie Luck: Sent to the same minimum-security prison as Louis, Freddie doesn't fare as well as Louis, however.<br/><br/><br/>WHAT WE DID<br/>After Mike left, we still gave Big Jack a scene, negotiated amongst us, and a die, agree upon by consensus. During our own scenes, we could only give dice to remaining players.<br/><br/>WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE DONE<br/>Doubled up the scenes and rewards, so we could have at least gotten to The Tilt before Mike had to leave, and angled to eliminate Jack as part of The Tilt, if not before.

I'm actually pleased that you ginned up a solution that worked for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
