                    So my wife and I were asked to run some new World of Darkness games at a local convention.  At first I was hesitant.  There are 100 games I would rather run. I mean with all the awesomeness we've experiences recently with games like Mortal Coil and Mountain Witch and the list goes on, WoD seems sort of trite.<br/><br/>But we agreed for some free crash space and begun the task of bringing life into one of the "big dogs."<br/><br/>I started adding concepts that we've been discussing from our Indie Game experiences - adding <i>bangs</i> to spur narrative control, using character backgrounds to drive hidden agendas and aggressive scene framing to pack in as much of the "important stuff" as we can in the four hours we have.<br/><br/>Joanna says something to the effect of "we're running a World of Darkness game, not one of our indie games."<br/><br/>That struck me.  Sure we all talk about the mechanics of the game promoting these ideas but how much am I misrepresenting a game by including these ideas.<br/><br/>So I am not ignoring elements of the new Storytelling system.  We plan on using Virtues and Vices and factions to add background elements and points of tension.  Since it's a con game I'm not going to give out normal XP and instead award players for using <i>bangs</i> and plot interaction.  Something that may be beyond the rules but again the rules are not specifically designed for convention one shots.<br/><br/>As such I realize that there are a great number of expectations from both veteren playes and those new to the World of Darkness.  We obviously want to forward an agenda - exposing a wider audience to many of the topics we discuss here and show others that "you too can have fun again" (a bit tongue n cheek).  <br/><br/>So what do you think are some of the pitfalls?  What sort of resistance have you seen to some of these techniques?  What games have you been using these ideas with and aanyone think WoD is a bad fit?                </div>

                            Pitfalls will happen when you use words like "Kicker" and "Bang", get the blank faces, do the "Ohmygosh, you don't know what Kickers and Bangs are?" and proceed to explain them. <br/><br/>Instead, just use them without giving them names.  IIRC, when Judd runs con games, he basically reads off the kicker for each character, and that's it. People grab the characters based on the kicker. I don't think Judd calls them a "kicker" or anything. <br/><br/>So, maybe just use the techniques without giving them names, without explaining WHY you're using them to the gamers. No terms/jargon, no elngthy explanations, just use them. See what happens. If they work, awesome. If they don't, then back it up with trad GM skillz.<br/><br/>That's about all I can recommend.  Kickers/Bangs/Say Yes Or Roll the Dice, etc all work demonstratively awesomely with WoD games (I used them in a Vampire one shot and two exalted games), and there's never a need to lift the veil to the gruesome gearwork of jargon and meanings behind actions.<br/><br/>Good luck!<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Something that I see all the time at any convention is the phrase, " Game X, using some house rules".  State that up front, include what you want, explain it to the players, and move on. I doubt anyone would make much a fuss. And you might just change their perspective as well. Just don't mention Forge. ;-)                        </div>

                            I have to echo Andy's thoughts. There's nothing wrong with setting up wants and needs and a line of backstory for a pre-gen.<br/><br/>Since kickers are meant to drive the action with a sense of immediacy, begin play with a scene that hits on a few of these characters' wants and shows contacts, effects, etc from backstory.                        </div>

Oh no, I don't actually use the "terminology."  I just do it.  We're making the characters so we frame scenes based on their virtues and vices right from the get go.  We have a list of ideas/items/places in their background and in it say "insert these into your narrative and gain story awards."  That sort of thing.                        </div>

                            You know, as I remember, White Wolf players love using their backgrounds in games anyway. I remember Vampire players writing long, long backstories for their characters.

                            So this is the idea:<br/><br/>We have a bunch of characters that are sort of doing their thing and interacting with the environment.  Each has a short list of ideas/items and bolded text in their backgrounds that they will be encouraged to utilize during the game which will give them narrative control.<br/><br/>So if a character that has "you've been dreaming about a book which is strange since you'd think you should be dreaming about girls and cars" and we come upon an empty desk that players is encouraged to narrate "oh, I find the book that I have been dreaming about."  What's it look like?  Do you open it?  What's inside?<br/><br/>Since there is a mild competetive bent to RPGs in cons with prize support and such we'll hand out the prize based on rewards the players will get by using these "instigators."                        </div>

How is that player encouraged?  I know that I would feel somewhat uncomfortable adding that in as a player without guidelines that supported it.  I wouldn't have any problems telling you what it was like when asked, but I would be hard pressed to offer it independent of specific event.                        </div>

Yeah, true enough that excellent GMs have been doing that sort of thing, however, I don't think most people are really used to it and I think there is a shortage of such player interactions.  This is especially true for such techniques being written into adventures.  In my experience most people either write a very linear plot where the characrers (and players) just jump through hoops to get from point A to point B or have complicated story webs and maps that they just allow the characters to meander through. I rarely see good scene generation based on specific character points or giving players the ability to do some narraration that actually effects the flow of the game.  Many of these are foreign to many gamers.  Even veterens tend to fall back on old ways.  I had created a really dynamic story web for my Artesia game that game the players a lot of flexability and the pacing was spot on.  When asked how to make it better player said "give out a relationship chart diagramming the dynamics between the characters (an important part of the game)."  I had been doing that sort of thing for decades.  Why hadn't I thought of it?  duh!<br/><br/>I believe when many gamers sit down to the table they will be a bit surprised to find out what comes back at them.  What I really hope for is a number of folk that are familiar with the play styles here and can get the ball rolling with me.                        </div>

Well having scenes based off the characters Virtues/Vices that involve and change them from the get go is certainly what I would call a kicker, no?                        </div>

                            No.  That would be really crude flags that could only be trusted because they're pregen characters.<br/><br/>Kickers are player-authored pieces of situation that allow PCs to begin play already moving.

                            Well, I guess I am not really focusing on the mechanics or the ideas, more on the conversation about people that have incorpoarted ideas that thay have been discussed here.  I have not really eludicated my ideas on how I am going to put into practice some of these ideas yet since I have barely thought about them.  <br/><br/>More I was seeking to explore situations where folks may have try to introduce such games or game elements and met with resitance.  maybe some actual play that didn't pan out like we had hoped.<br/><br/>Here, I will start:<br/><br/><b>Mortal Coil: A Home of Our Own</b><br/>So we started a cool little D&amp;D spin off.  I have mentioned it here before.  Its a game based on the idea that the gods of Dragonlance are brought back by the exploits in a former campaign and in this one our PCs are cast out because we have become like-little-gods and there is no room for us (I just don't think they liked the competition).<br/><br/>So we're using a rough draft of the D&amp;D multiverse including Crystal Spheres and nine hells and Astral travel and the whole bit.  But we're gods now searching for a new home, a place where we can solidify our existance through worshippers.<br/><br/>One player read through the rules.  She missed a session and some player narration created a situation that was interpreted poorly.  One of the players had spent a magic token to say that his character was capable of dedicating a temple to a god and proceeded to have a conversation about doing so in the meeting hall of the gods in order to help protect it.  Assumptions were made about what that really meant and instead of taking the discussion in character or setting down the facts of what having a temple dedicated to a god meant she god really miffed at player initiating the discussion.  Player A, lets call him <i>me</i> <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> tried to explain that I as a player was trying to initaiate some sense of minor conflict to be hashed out within the game and asked what she would do if it was the GM that initiated the conflict.  that wasn't good enough because it was my character that was involved in the dedication.  Fine, I spent a magic token and burned a power toekn and said that after some discussion it was an NPC god that the meeting hall was dedicated to, not my own - a goddess of community.  The player was besides herself.  She couldn't deal with the idea that I could use points to create facts about the game.  She had so been entrenched in the idea that the setting was laid out before you and you reacted to it (and that all was known by the players before you began playing) that just couldn't see playing a game where that sort of thing could happen.  <br/><br/>There was a social contract where everyone knew what system we were playing.  We did a long description of what the mechanics did and made all the characters together.  We all seemd to get that we had a good deal of control over what the setting was going to be and that the most important aspects of the game werethe Passions.  In my estimation I sorta felt like years and years of D&amp;D inertia caught up with us - and that's a lot of books compared to little ol' Mortal Coil <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>What were some of your experiences in this vien and what do I have to look out for when incorporating the ideas into more mainstream games?                        </div>

                            I so have to agree with Judd here. Part of the problem with 'bangs' and 'kickers' is they have got associated with 'new-fangled Forgie ways' which puts some people off. Using the term tends to result in people saying 'I don't see anything wrong with the way I used to play'. I've seen people really resistant because they believe you are saying 'you are playing wrong'. See bang and kicker were just the terms Ron used to highlight a way of playing that had been around for a while. He didn't even claim to have invented it, just tagged it with a name. I am certainly aware of 'bangs' beforehand, though kickers were new on me.<br/>
<br/>
Setting + Story Now is really old. To be honest those old AD&amp;D modules were, IMO, early incarnations of this: Setting was just 'The steading of the hill giant chief' and story now just 'The giants keep coming down in to the lowlands and raiding. The king sends you to go and kick giant butt' but it was the same principle at work. The Morrow Project is one I really remember as setting up their scenarios like this. Most of the module was the description of a community teetering on the edge of conflict. The last 4 or 5 pages of the module 'Play of the Game' were around how to use the material. It always began with 'wake-up'  for the frozen team - always throwing a bang right at the players like 'the alarm sounds and as you wake up you realize your bolt hole is filling with water and if you don't get out you will drown' Then it discussed the cnonflict that the players were likely to meet when they entered the setting. It was clearly non-linear with direct advice from the reactions of playtest groups to what happened etc. Of course some were better than others and had a real 'story now' set up - the Mexicans are invading - while others allowed the players to wander at will a bit more. But still its the same principle. Create setting with opportunity for conflict. Story Now. Drive with bangs. I used to love reading those 'play of the game' sections, because I really saw how to make this material come alive.<br/>
<br/>
We've got better at refining the tools for this sort of play, but the philosophy is not new.<br/>
<br/>
What's perhaps more interesting is where the more railroaded approach started, but I think this is moving toward being a seperate thread.<br/>
<br/>
i think that Judd made a useful 'good sentence' on Sons of Kyros about this that went something like tell the players "There is nothing you ought to do, but I have things you can do". Judd?                        </div>

                            I introduced the term "Flags" to my group, my group, and they took to it like ducks to water. They're constantly using it in feedback, like "just in case you're unclear, my guy has a huge flag regarding that," or "hey, I was sending up a major flag there! Why didn't you run with that?" It's great. I've also mentioned scene framing, which I defined for them as simply "skip to the good stuff."<br/>
<br/>
Thing is, this is the crowd that has weathered and even embraced such terms as "metagame," "hit points," "saving Throw," and "lawful evil alignmnent." They can buck up and take a few more funny words into their vocabulary pool if they help describe gaming phenomena usefully and lead to better play.<br/>

Sorry to misrepresent you.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn't suggesting that I was ashamed of the words, just the reaction they sometimes create at the table as well as the forum. But maybe that's just my experience. Flags and scene framing do seem more neutral but get some reaction too. Now some of those people have become more comfortable withe them over time, but they didn't like them when first introduced.                        </div>

                            eruditus,<br/><br/>Here's a post at the Forge where I give an idea where I'm coming from in regard to trying to win-over reticent old-school players:<br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21622.msg221828#msg221828" rel="nofollow">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21622.msg221828#msg221828</a><br/><br/>More specifically-- in reference to your excellent Mortal Coil post above-- That incident is familiar to me, too.  I have a close friend, so old school that he prefers the term  <a href="http://www.spookylibrarians.com/nimble.wav" rel="nofollow">Maze Controller</a> from Mazes &amp; Monsters, to "DM" or "GM".   Any reference to 'indie' or 'forge' or 'hippie' games as the source of an idea-- taints that idea in his mind.  Yet, to his credit, that taint takes the form of applying critical scrutiny to whatever he's hearing and offering laser-sharp criticism of it.  Subsequently, I talk to him more about new game concepts than anyone else.  Often, I'd prefer if he'd just grasp an idea and share my enthusiasm: digest a good idea and move on to the next bite.  But his killjoy critique does help me really see all sides of concepts, too.<br/><br/>And I've come to see that he's like the Mortal Coil player you mentioned: he has a mental picture of rpgs as a process, like a complex machine with certain necessary parts.  When you start tampering with or removing or replacing those parts; he tries to visualize how the machine will possibly work The Same Way afterward.  And, of course, it won't.  Same deal with 'letting everybody grab the steering wheel on the road', to extend the metaphor.<br/><br/>So I've got to concede he's right.  And the best I can do is show him that the machine will now function A Different Way. <br/>So now he dismissively talks about 'most of those story-telling games' in an over-generalized way.   And now we're in the position of debating which machine is better: the old one or the newfangled one.  Some of his points are legitimate: many narr games require players to bring more to the table, instead of just sitting back and listening until it's time to roll dice and kill something.  Some of his points are ignorant: "all those games don't have a GM or dice and don't work for long campaigns only one-shots."  Occasionally he's surprise me by adopting a truly strange new idea without hesitation.  He'll even shrug and play new games... but they haven't displaced his affection for a Platonic Ideal of perfect old game that whirrs beautifully in his mind. (And he's a pretty good DM, too.)<br/><br/>In conclusion, at least he's over the mental hurdle of the woman you described.  She's still at the point where she thinks you're just breaking the game with Powergamer Munchkin tricks and Conflict of Interest between your agenda as a Player and your power to Narrate like a meta-god.     And she's even in the right ballpark: those are things that would wreck the old machine she's envisioning in her head.   The trick is getting her to envision a new machine.  To lead a horse to water.  And enthusiasm isn't always contagious.                        </div>

                            Although ideas like bangs, kickers, flags, aggressive scene framing and so on currently mostly come out of the indie movement, I don't see anything about them which limits them to indie games.<br/><br/>They may work better with indie games, I have no view on that, but they are GMing techniques that would easily work with most trad games.<br/><br/>As such, I suspect the issue may be one of labelling them, of making them a big thing rather than just GMing tools.  There is no reason you can't run Gurps with flags, kickers, bangs et al and while Sorceror might get better results with that approach I think these techniques would add to a Gurps game too.<br/><br/>In short, I don't think there is anything intrinsic to trad gaming which makes these problematic, I suspect the issue is more one of labelling or overemphasising them.  If you just use them, without discussing them any more than you would discuss any other techniques you use in GMing I suspect there will be far less resistance.                        </div>

I think that's right, what is better than how gaming used to be is that previously people would have these ideas, but other than personal contact they weren't really transmitted.  Now they are.<br/><br/>I mean, the Let it Ride rule from Burning Wheel is way obvious, but somehow had never occurred to me.  No doubt tons of people have done it in tons of games over time, but I hadn't encountered that, so since I didn't personally think of it I missed a really easy and useful GMing tip.<br/><br/>Now, it's written down and discussed.  I came across it and it has, in a small way, improved my games which are distinctly trad.<br/><br/>And that's the thing, these ideas being communicated is great because a lot of GM advice is frankly crap.  But the ideas themselves, the best of them are IMO rather obvious, that's what makes them powerful, they're obvious things that some of us for whatever reason never thought of.<br/><br/>Different people miss different things, I had used relationship maps for years before I saw Sorceror, but kickers and bangs were wholly new to me.  I have heard others say the exact opposite, but it does these techniques a disservice to mystify them or oversell them, what they are is damn good GMing advice that won't fit every game but that will fit some and which are well worth the trying.                        </div>
