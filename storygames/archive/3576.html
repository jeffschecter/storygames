Okay. In D&amp;D 3x, there's a table of suggested skill DCs, but no hard and fast rules for <i>determining</i> such a DC other than application of good judgement. Both Storytelling and Storyteller are also good for this (they have a recommended default difficulty, but ultimately what a player needs to roll to succeed is up to the Storyteller). In Fudge difficulties are ranked using entirely subjective adjectives, thus difficulties are. . . uhm. . . entirely subjective. Risus, works almost exatly like Token does, recommending a small list of difficulties and leaving the deterimination of actual difficulty in regard to a given action or goal up to the GM's discretion. Ditto the D6 System (which is were Risus nabbed much if its core mechanic, actually). This list could go on, though I think that for the purposes of satisfying your curiosity, this should be sufficient.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Sure, systems like BRP, BESM 1e and 2e, and most other systems that utilize a 'roll under' mechanic don't rely on fiat to determine the difficulty of accomplishing a given action or achieving a goal -- the 'difficulty' in such games is typically limited only by the aptitude of a character, and that aptitude is clearly defined in concrete terms. In BRP, for example, if a character has the skill <i>Library Use</i> at 76%, they need to roll a 76% or less in order to succeed in using that skill. It's pretty cut and dried. It's also not for everybody. I think that fiat, while it requires a potentially large degree of trust, also makes for a much more dynamic play experience.<br/><br/>[Edit: While I like the idea of players being able to choose their own difficulty and weighing that against the GM's judgement, I think that adds an unnecessary complication to the game. Really, if you don't trust your GM to assign fair difficulties, I rather think that you're either playing with the Wrong Group or you have some deep-seeded intimacy issues that roleplaying games aren't going to fix.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

That's not very constructive, as all it does is confirm something that I already have (i.e., my awareness that such games exist) without shining any light on the problems that you apparently see. And frankly, if you can't offer <i>constructive</i> criticism, it's bet to offer none at all. Now. . . <br/><br/>If you'd like to explain <i>why</i> you think that relying on GM fiat is a bad idea and <i>why</i> going another way is a better option, then we may have something to talk about. That seems like it may be a constructive criticism that involves examining actual alternatives. So far all you've done is ask a question and drop some hints that you'd do it differently, without any allusion as to <i>why</i>.

I've had situations when <i>I</i> was the GM and didn't trust <i>myself</i> to assign fair difficulties. In games like D&amp;D that require a lot of prep-work it can be <i>awfully</i> tempting, when players decide to do something completely unexpected, to assign high difficulties to things in order to stall their progress in order to buy yourself some time to prepare. Conversely, when a player decides to do something <i>really cool</i>, you're naturally going to want them to succeed, so it's tempting to lower the difficulty for that action. Either way, it eventually devolves into a game of "guess what the GM wants," and that is most decidedly Not Fun for me, as a player <i>or</i> as a GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_80564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80564/#Comment_80564" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-11T07:17:00+00:00" title="July 11, 2007  7:17AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 11, 2007 7:52AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey James, have you followed any of the discussions recently about the division of authority and GMless play?

It reminds me aesthetically of "the Pool" in good ways. The thing I really like is the Creation Characters bit where, it seems, you (1) write a character description, and (2) if it meets the rubric, you (3) are rewarded with a bigger die pool. That seems like a nice way, and it seems easy to customize that rubric for the kind of game you're wanting to run. (For example, I might add in "Describe how you were wrong by the Space Empire. 3 Dice" for my space-opera-rebellion game.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIdea for the Setting Conventions: maybe in world creation you mark some of those as "challengeable", i.e. if your character defies one of those conventions in a problematic &amp; interesting way, you can still be rewarded. This can be good if it's within limits, and provided that these aren't the hard-setting boundaries. ("Thou shalt not lie" should be challengeable, but maybe "Thou shalt defend the Church." will be declared a hard boundary for the campaign.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMechanics question: is their a cap to the pool, or to the number of dice you can roll for something?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_80567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80567/#Comment_80567" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-11T07:23:59+00:00" title="July 11, 2007  7:23AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FWIW: I don't see a problem with GM-managed difficulties.

For me, it <i>is </i>bad because you can't play all-out.  Putting complete control over adversity in the hands of one person with unlimited power just isn't interesting.  <br/><b><br/>Why would another method be better?</b><br/>Again for me - and I recognize a whole universe of preference out there - knowing that all my friends, including the GM, are playing as hard as they can is engaging, challenging, and fun.  Show me a system that requires this and I'll show you a game I can get behind.  Prime Time Adventures is a great example of this, because the ecosystem of reward in that game dries up if people are not engaged and playing aggressively - it literally signals you when you should stop playing and watch a movie or something.  The GM has a lot of power, but it is sharply demarcated and never arbitrary.  <br/><br/><b>What method would you suggest and why?</b><br/>I really enjoy games that distribute that authority a bit.  There's no reason for a single auteur to have so much power over a group narrative other than tradition.  I love being the GM, and I love telling my friends a story - I love it so much I want everybody to have that power at the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_80695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

That seems like it may be a constructive criticism that involves examining actual alternatives. So far all you've done is ask a question and drop some hints that you'd do it differently, without any allusion as to why. So. . . uhm. . . out with it!</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>No problem. I just wasn't sure what you wanted.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Why is reliance on GM fiat when assigning difficulties bad?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>It means that the GM can't bust balls. It means that, when the GM wants to turn up the heat, it's a completely arbitrary decision. If they do it at the wrong time, it feels like cheating to the players, so it becomes a mind reading game instead of a storytelling one. And if the GM doesn't do it at all, the players don't feel like they're doing anything. Because they're not.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, in such a game, the only rule that matters is "Make the GM happy and you'll get what you want". I've played that game and I bet you have, too. I've been the beneficiary of that game and occasionally on the shitty end of it. If you want to see it <em>really</em> in action, watch a group where there's a couple in the game and one of them is GM.</p>\n<p>Secondarily, it encourages the GM, as a rule system, to direct the players with in-game events, making it easier to do what the GM wants than do other stuff, thereby diminishing the input of the other players.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Why would another method be better?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Because if you look at the authorities vested in a traditional GM, you'll see that they equate to several conflicts of interest. The GM is responsible for the players' fun, where that means making things not too easy and not too hard, the precise definition of that having to do with the meaning of the conflicts to the characters, the relationships between the players, the mood folks are in, etc.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>What method would you suggest and why?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>In my published games, the authorities are distributed to different players at different times so as to avoid conflicts of interest. If your job is to offer opposition, you offer opposition as hard as you can. If your job is to show approval for someone's ideas, you're not responsible for opposition. If your job is to play a protagonist, you play the guy as hard as you can (or as hard as you want. Sometimes, you don't like the character and want to see them suffer.)</p>\n<p>It's very likely you've had fun with games that use a traditional GM. I certainly have. What's going on when that's happening is that the GM and players have communicated something really well, probably when and what kind of opposition to give. If you can figure out how to reliably reproduce that communication, that's a rule. Write it down and now you can have fun all the time!</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
