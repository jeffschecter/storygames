No character is ever more than a few connections away. A scene between any two characters has the potential to directly influence the entire relationship map. So the game is played in moves, each of which impacts the whole board more or less directly.<br/><br/>In Go, a piece more often exerts an indirect influence that wanes as you get further away, though in theory it extends across the board. It's played in skirmishes which are primarily local, but indirectly change the overall landscape.<br/><br/>I think if Burning Empires as conceptually rather like Go. A particular move, such as a color scene where you introduce a technology, may be of very minor significance in the moment, but exert a strategic influence far away. A particular scene may change the relationship between the involved characters, but have no direct impact on other characters in the phase, or across the phases of the invasion. At least that's how I see the intention of BE.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201512/#Comment_201512" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-10T09:12:27+00:00" title="April 10, 2009  9:12AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I nominate IAWA and Dogs as Go-like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201515/#Comment_201515" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-10T09:29:57+00:00" title="April 10, 2009  9:29AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>What makes these games Go-like?

Their actions will explicitly change the Companies and have an indirect effect on their relationships with other characters not present, but there's pretty much no problem with the scenario in which somehow we end up playing the same PCs for 4 sessions in a row. Later when Steve the neglected PC prince turns up at the table, he will e.g. find his kingdom much poorer and much larger and this radically changes the way he will be played, but play which caused this had vanishingly small need to consider Steve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201534/#Comment_201534" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-10T12:33:39+00:00" title="April 10, 2009 12:33PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the new political-soaked Pathfinder-ish game I'm running, each player is pulling strings for different outcomes in a semi-annual meeting of the guilds.

It's structured so that each situation has an R-Map, with a meta-R-map determining larger outcomes as they each resolve.

I'm not seeing it.</p>\nThe first thing to remember is that in Go the board starts blank.  If there is a little skirmish in one corner of the board, another skirmish may open up somewhere else without any reference to the first skirmish.  As the skirmishes develop through play, they might end up touching one another and then their current states affect each other.  Think of it in terms of context \u2014 stones only have meaning in relation to other stones nearby.  A long enough game makes each stone relate, eventually and perhaps massively indirectly, to every other stone on the board.  But most of play is relatively encapsulated.<br/><br/>This is like IAWA because each chapter you play may open a new 'skirmish' with its own oracles and in a completely different place and time.  As you play, however, some characters or locations or even items will show up more than once, carrying with them the context of their prior appearances.  Now, Go has a finite board while IAWA has an infinite "board," but one could imagine playing IAWA long enough that all of the stories and characters and whatnot knit together into one massive, if decentralized, anthology of stories.<br/><br/>Dogs is similar except you could consider each new town as a skirmish that is just next to the last skirmish, so there is some context (the GM pushing player statements to see how far the PCs will go), but most of the town is new.  Eventually the town-skirmishes creep their way around and across the board, filling it up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
