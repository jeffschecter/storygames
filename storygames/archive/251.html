                    Yesterday at the fantastic Troublicon, some of my peeps played and hated Once Upon A Time.  "The rules say <em>the ending only counts if everyone agrees that's cool</em>" somebody said.  Clinton called it an <em>ultra</em> dirty hippie game, which is pretty funny and accurate.  The whole thing got me thinking about dickery.<br/><br/>You know dickery - some games address it explicitly and some don't.  You can be a total dick and break any game, but it is generally assumed that nobody will tolerate playing with a dick more than once, so it is a non-issue in design, right?  Or is it?  <br/><br/>My question here is where to draw that line.  In the Roach I address dickery obliquely, by adding an "I call bullshit" rule - but it only applies to narrating in NPCs, which I perceive as the place most open to unwitting abuse.  The Roach is a game <em>wide open</em> to dickery and, as a result, very easy to ruin if that's what you want to do.  I didn't even worry about it.  I'm interested in your thoughts on dickery, and whether it should be addressed in design, and if so, how.<br/><br/>(and just to be clear, I'm totally OK with you guys hating OUAT!  After all, I hate .. well, lots of things you think are the cat's pajamas!)                </div>

                            If Dickery = intentionally breaking the game, I don't think you need to address it at all.  After all, most games can be broken with some well-placed dickery.  The stuff you address in the Roach, the "unwitting abuse", is all I think that needs to be done.  You can put warning signs around the tarpits but you can't stop people from jumping into them headfirst if they really want to.<br/>

                            I think about dickery in terms of player buy-in. Basically, its when people at the table don't buy in to the game that dickery happens, right? So I think addressing/supporting/creating player buy-in is definitly a relevant design issue.<br/>
<br/>
Case in point: Primetime Adventures. The show pitch process pulls everyone's creativity together, getting everyone on the same page, thus making it so that everyone buys into the show. No dickery, in my experience. Game on.                        </div>

                            Naw.  I think that every game's equally easy to break.  Chess is a pretty tight game, right?  All you have to do to break it is play to loose.  Instant dickery.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I think that some games have larger tarpits of unintentional problems.  Tarpits that may or may not be identified very well for the players.<br/>
<br/>
And, if it were easier to be a dick in one game than in another, would it matter?  It's still intentionally trying to break the game, which is a social issue, not a design issue.<br/>

                            I think Nathan just demonstrated that there can be a confluence of system elements that discourage dickery.  Just because it is a social issue doesn't mean that game mechanics can't address it in some way, right?  I'm just poking this with a stick to see what happens.                        </div>

                            Well, the only thing that comes to mind is for the game text to be very explicit about what it's all about.  If the players know exactly what's expected of them before things get started then they'll be less likely to suddenly discover that they're not playing a game that they want to play.  And I'd imagine that finding yourself to be playing a game that you really don't want to play is probably a pretty solid source of unplanned dickery.                        </div>

                            Resisting dickery (great word!) has been a design goal of mine since I began writing Ends and Means. LARPs thrive on lots of players, but lots of players means it's all the more likely one will have a PHD in Dickery, and it really only takes one or two such players to run a LARP into the ground.<br/><br/>My design resists dickery in a few ways: <ul><li>It's a resource-based system in which winners pay losers, so if someone's messing with you, at least they're making you more powerful in the process.</li><li>It's fluid: if someone's messing with you this session, you can completely shuffle your numbers around so that next session they can't do it again the same way. </li><li>It's very stop-at-the-skin: it is impossible to do long-term damage to anyone's character without their explicit buy-in.</li><li>Character advancement reaches a plateau: long-term play doesn't make it too much easier to mess with others.</li></ul> </div>

                            We played <i>Once Upon a Time</i> with a pretty large group of friends at our house after FiranCon last year (or the year before that, who can remember). <br/><br/>One dude -- his name is Max -- had this habit of totally steering the story off a cliff. We'd have this great story going, then he'd toss down a card and say, more or less, "Yeah, they all die, and then THIS happens." Basically he was discounting our entire story and using it as a rubber crutch to shift to his own story. He kept doing it even after we collectively yelled at him. He was being a dick.                        </div>

                            The problem with true dickery is that the true dick doesn't care about what happens in the game. Like, if you're being a dick in D&amp;D (say, you always attack the other characters for absolutly no reason), no amount of withholding XP will make you stop. The true dick doesn't buy into the game, which is a prerequisite for addressing social issues with mechanics. <br/><br/>Now, if you can present mechanics that <i>engage</i> someone who would otherwise be a true dick, thus making them care about the fiction - thats a design issue worth addressing. Otherwise, it's all social contract, baby.                        </div>

                            Actually, I like Shreyas's answer. If you're a dick you become useless in the game. Combine that with social contract and getting people to buy in and you're on the right path. <br/><br/>I don't think it would work all the time, and it certainly isn't the end all answer, but it's also better than shrugging shoulders and saying that there's nothing to be done.                        </div>

<p>Totally.  Mechanics can <em>marginalize</em> people.  It's a hellaciously useful threat against a dick, because most dicks are stubbornly, inescapably attention-seeking.  If their very dickery leads to their getting less (or <em>zero</em>) attention then they get all conflicted.</p>

                            I also like the judo-esque approach, because it obviates the need for a confrontation to kick the dick out.  If his dickery results in more fun for everyone else (more concentrated currency), that elegantly resolves the problem and he's free to go.                        </div>

<p>And that leads to <em>less</em> dickery in your experience?  My experience tells me that the person who's being dickish, when marginalized, will either leave the game or become even more dickish.  If having the dick leave the game is desirable, then why not just show them the door without the use of mechanisms?</p>
<p>I think what's really missing here is talking about <em>why</em> people act like dicks.  There's so many different reasons.  There's the attention-seeking dick, like Tony mentioned.  There's the dick who feels tricked into playing a crappy game and wants the game to end as soon as possible.  There's the unintentional dick who doesn't realize they're fucking up the game.  So many possiblities and I don't think that all of them can be addressed in the same way.</p>

<b>Shreyas Sampat</b> wrote...<br><i>Consider a game where all currency is awarded by other players.<br/><br/>If you're being a dick, you stop getting currency. You stop being effective and interesting. In Torchbearer, your story ends first and the world forgets you.</i><br/><br/>First, I don't think this is phrased quite right since nearly all games have currency awarded by others.  (That is, the number of self-award games is vanishingly small, though I think it is an avenue for some cool possibilities.)  Second, in my experience, it is easy to be a dick in trying to get other players to give you stuff.  There are quite a number of games which I  consider essentially popularity contests.  Diplomacy is often this way, as is Illuminati.  Now, these popularity contests depend on being rewarded by other players -- but I find them to be full of dickery.  <br/><br/>One common case is whining.  This doesn't have to be too overt.  Just imagine two players: one is shy and quietly accepts not getting many rewards, but the other feels really hurt and is clearly so when other people don't give him reward tokens for his play.  The other players don't really think his stuff is very cool, but they find it a pain to play when he's unhappy and dispirited at the table -- so they give him tokens for his play and he cheers up.  <br/><br/>There are a number of other cases I could discuss, but I'd first see if other people are down with the principle.  That is, that social rewards (which all games have) can still foster dickery.                        </br></div>

                            I agree, John:  that's punishment by reward.  It encourages well-intentioned players to reform, but if one's intentions are selfish to begin with, punishment won't affect one's actions.

                            If anything, I think the bare minimum that needs to be addressed is simply the idea that you shouldn't play with people who are dicks.  The sad truth is that we're still fighting a lot of geek social fallacies, and whether you mechanically back it or not, people need to know that in the same way you don't play chess with the guy who flips the board when he's angry, you don't play games with people who act like dicks.<br/><br/>I also agree that mechanics that give negative reinforcements for busting social contract are a good thing.                        </div>

                            I suspect that dickery is pretty hard to marginalize when it isn't extreme by printed rules. It's also hard to define. I've seen chess played "by a dick" and it's as ugly and unpleasant as doing anything else with a jerk (and the guy was playing by the rules and playing to win). <br/>
<br/>
There can be group censure rules (if everyone else votes you off the island, off you go) and that can help--or there can be team-up and kick out the annoying guy rules (which require less than an ultimatium). Or there can be a judge of dickery (maybe an elected offical) who can negate your input if you are being a jerk.<br/>
<br/>
Over all, though, I think going to far in this direction is putting in a lot of stuff that isn't directly addressing the problem--that bein' you're playing with a jerk.<br/>

                            I think that any player who understands the system sufficiently can be a dick, and earn the currency.  Whether it's on a social level (whining, etc) or on a rules level.<br/>

A consequence of this, is that no game is immune to dickery.<br/>
<br/>
I've pointed out ways that a Capes player can engage in dickery and get rewarded before - I won't go into them now, but discussion rolled back to, "If anyone played that way at my table, they wouldn't play again."                        </div>

                            I'll throw in some thoughts from board and card games here.  <br/><br/>So I personally dislike games that I feel amount to popularity contests.  A great many multiplayer games do this, in my opinion.  For example, in Illuminati you can spend down any other player at any time.  I find that effectively, this comes down to the players voting which person they would like to win for personal reasons.  I like better games where such interaction is restricted.  In something like Settlers of Catan, you have relatively few options to stop a winning player.  You can refuse to trade with them, but that hurts you as well as hurting them.  In my opinion, better designs reduce the popularity effect, and also keep all players engaged and in the game with a chance of winning.  If you make mistakes, you can lag behind but should still have a small chance of winning.  <br/><br/>I have seen the same thing in role-playing games.  In particular, I have played in  games with player-voted awards that became more like a popularity contest.  Worse, I've seen vicious cycles where the rewards to the popular mean that newbies, shy players, and passive players are subtlely edged out of effective  participation while they're still in the game.  These are dangers that I worry about in my games.  The leading players are being dicks to a degree, but they were also doing what the game rewarded: doing cool stuff and gaming the system.  <br/><br/>Recent popular designs vary in this.  For example, Primetime Adventures has open social awards -- but Dogs in the Vineyard has no parallel.  It very specifically rewards the mechanical options of Fallout / Taking the Blow.  I like the latter because it has a clearly defined way to get a reward.                        </div>

                            I agree, John.  I prefer my reinforcement system to be as straightforward and objectively judged as possible.  Certainly the goal of the game design is to guide players to entertaining each other, but the most straightfoward means of judging that success (player voting) edges into popularity-contest land.  I find that identifying how the game is supposed to entertain the players, and then rewarding <em>that</em> behavior, is a better bet.                        </div>

<p>I tend to think that the most satisfying games <em>are</em> popularity-contest games; all satisfying party games boil down to, "Look how cool I am", or "Look how well I understand my friends."</p>
<p><em>Apples to Apples</em> is a brilliant example of the latter. So is <em>Therapy.</em></p>
<p>Basically, I feel like masking the popularity contest element (there needs to be a better word than contest here; the point at issue is more subtle than "who do we like best?"; I think it is better-described as a celebration of a play group's connectedness) is a socially dangerous thing to do.</p>

                            My reaction to the whole idea of using game design to combat dickery is utter disbelief. Chris mentioned geek fallacies above, and I agree completely. I think that if you're going to attempt to deal with dickery in your game text at all, the best thing you can do for the players is promote the handling of the dick situations as mature, socially responsible people. Don't promote maginalization of the dick through game currency or a multitude of other possible ways to avoid confronting the dickery directly.<br/>
<br/>
I think the issue is pretty simple. Don't abide dickery, period. Call people on their dickery, let them know that you think they're being a dick, and let them know that their behavior won't be tolerated. Once you've done those things, most of the work is done. You just have to be willing to not play with dicks.<br/>

Popularity contests often spring up because players aren't fully engaged in making the game better for all the players.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that the problem isn't the mechanic.  It's the level of engagement, and the amount of responsibility the players feel towards the game.                        </div>

                            Chris, sometimes there needs to be a mechanism where players can subtly signal their own personal perception of dickery, without risking being alone in that perception.<br/>
<br/>
What happens when I get fed up, call it as I see it, and I'm the only one?  Suddenly I'm the dick.<br/>
<br/>
This is why people don't do what you're talking about.  Noone wants to be the first.<br/>

The mechanics people are talking about are ways to subtly achieve that consensus.                        </div>

                            Chris, I agree with Fred's comment, and I'd like to add that "dick/nondick" is not a binary metric when applied to players.  We're talking about <i>actions</i> perceived as dickery, not about players who happen to be dicks.  Some game mechanics encourage players to be dicks, or deprive them of agency so they're more likely to engage in dickery--can we agree on that?  If so, doesn't it follow that other mechanics can promote satisfaction of all players, reducing the likelihood that anyone will dick out at the table?<br/>
<br/>
I agree that role-players in particular must be on guard against the GSFs.  After you've decided to kick the dicks out of the room, though, it's partly the designer's responsibility to ensure that players aren't pushed down the dickery slippery slope.                        </div>

I think that what you're talking about is an important aspect of game play as well.  We play games with our friends to enjoy their company; their intellect, creativity, emotional portfolio, and all the little immeasurables. Games are social endeavors, and clamping down too hard on the unpleasant side of the 'popularity contest' element can hinder the beneficial aspects of community reinforcement.<br/>
<br/>
Fred,<br/>
<br/>
There's no risk in being alone in your perception of dickery. If you're the only one that thinks someone is being dick, maybe you read them incorrectly. That's okay. Discuss the issue, decide if you still think the person is being a dick and what you, personally, need to do about it. Stay and play and see how it goes, decide that maybe it would be best if you bowed out, whatever. Anything besides working towards clear and honest communication is just wankery.<br/>

I agree, it's not binary at all. That's why I don't see how maneuvering around player social behavior through the game system is going to help the issue. If you want to know what someone is doing and why, ask them. If they're lying, it will be obvious soon enough. The idea is to find out if they are being purposefully disruptive or not and then handle the situation. Not put the issue off by hoping the game system will handle it for you. This is how those geek social fallacies were reinforced to begin with. <br/>

<p>Chris, I think you're minimizing the impact of asking someone if they're deliberately being a dick.</p>
<p>To be clear:  I've seen people <strong>be dicks</strong> by doing exactly what you're suggesting.  I have seen (more than once) a player in an <em>Amber Throne War</em> say things like "How could you betray me!  You're being such a dick!  Are you trying to hurt my feelings?"  By doing that they are clearly labelling behavior that would otherwise be <em>expected</em> in the game (i.e. betrayal and backstabbing) as dickery.  Those people, to borrow Andy's phrase, need to be punched in the cocks.</p>
<p>Brendan's on a good line here:  the issue isn't whether a <em>person</em> is a dick but whether their <em>actions</em> are disruptive to the game.  It is definitely good to say to people "This action is not appropriate within the context of this game."  I recommend that the absolute <strong>best</strong> way of saying that is through mechanics that reward or punish specific actions.</p>

You seem to be saying, "Look, I can stand up and call dickery when I see it, so should you, and so should everyone else.  There's no need for subtle resource-play to identify dickery."  I must be misunderstanding you.                        </div>

                            Chris, I've been fortunate enough never to play an RPG that involved serious dickery, so I'm going to use some examples from other kinds of games to illustrate my point.<br/>
<br/>
When my friends and I played Halo multiplayer, we were dicks.  Split-screen Halo--especially on a small map--can be absolutely brutal, especially since both your starting weapons are capable of killing another player in less than one clip.  After about the third time I'd spawned and died within five seconds, I'd start being an absolute pissant; I screamed and kicked like a baby.  But we kept playing anyway, because we are having fun, sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Halo 2 considerably reduces starting-weapon lethality, removes health, and increases shield charge speed; also, the maps are much less open than in the first game.  All of those things make camping harder and staying alive after spawning much easier.  Do we still yell and call each other horrible things when we die?  Sure.  But nobody walks away with the same feeling of utter ranklement as we used to.<br/>
<br/>
If you'd asked me why I was a big baby when playing Halo, I'd have said "that's just the energy of the game" or "that's how I express getting frustrated."  Both of those were true.<br/>
<br/>
If Halo had been an RPG, we would have sat around the table and said "this is frustrating; how can we house-rule it to make it less so?"  It probably would have worked.  And just as it should have been Bungie's job to make Halo less frustrating, it should be an RPG designer's job to make a game that doesn't need to be house-ruled to be fun.<br/>
<br/>
(I was going to include an example from Munchkin here too, but reading over this I think it would be redundant.)                        </div>

I'm with you. Playing the game is not being a dick. Thinking that someone has a personal vendetta against you because they're playing the game is not cool. But neither is not bringing up whatever issue you have and working it out.<br>

I don't think you're misunderstanding me to any great degree. I just think we have a completely different view of the best way to handle uncomfortable social situations. I think that doing so through game mechanisms will be damaging in the long term. <br>
<br>
Playing games is a form of social conditioning, one that has helped reinforce a lot of damage in how many gamers socialize. I'd rather not see that perpetuated.<br>

You're talking about something completely different than I am. You were apparently unhappy with the game itself, not the behavior of your fellow players, which was totally in line with the game you were playing. The game mechanisms got adjusted and you got happier. Your friends behavior stayed the same. That's not dickery, that's playing a game you're not happy with.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I'm going to not reply to anything else in this thread for a bit. I can't type fast enough to keep up. So, if you have something to say, I'm not ignoring you, just taking a break.<br/>

<p>And I see game mechanics as a <em>tool</em> for working those issues out.</p>
<p>For instance, I will argue that you'll <strong>never</strong> see that "How dare you betray me?" bullshit in a game of <em>The Mountain Witch</em>.  Why?  Because all of the potential outcomes of trust (including being betrayed) are spelled out with crystal clarity.  You can't understand the rules and  misunderstand what people are saying about trust in that game.</p>
<p>The rules make that particular form of dickery <em>much</em> harder to come to, and much less pernicious when it occurs.  Basically, if someone says that in a Mountain Witch game I'm not going to think they're being a dick.  I'm just going to laugh.</p>

                            And, of course, there are differing ideas about what constitutes being a dick. For example, I found Illuminati to not-a-popularity-contest. Everyone was damn engaged to win. People got spent down when they got close.<br/>

You both seem to be saying the same thing as Brendan in his last post. If the game itself is leading to unhealthy player clashes, then yes, that should be addressed. It's not the same thing I'm talking about though, which is external to the specific game you play. A quick and simple discussion will generally help you separate which is which at the table. <br/>
<br/>
I also think there's an issue at play here that is bad sportsmanship just as much as being an all out dick. That issue being way oversensitive and defensive when everybody is playing in the spirit of the game and you get hosed. That seems like  a from of passive-aggressive dickery to me. But then, I rank bad sportsmanship as a severely horrible thing.<br/>

                            Chris -- If what you're talking about is things which happen regardless of what game is being played, then by definition it cannot be addressed through game design.  In that case, Jason's original question is pointless.  By definition, that can't be addressed in design.  <br/>
<br/>
Can you give some more concrete examples of what you're talking about?  I gave the example of the sensitive and/or whiny player who feels hurt when no one likes his ideas.  This is a behavior which is enabled by player-voted awards or player-given tokens, but largely avoided by Dogs in the Vineyard's fallout-based rewards.                        </div>

                            I see the source of the behavior as the problem, John, not what the player may be whining about. The source of the behavior is not those player-voted awards, it's the person's attitude. A real dick will just find something else to be a dick about. Repeatedly, over and over.<br/>
<br/>
Dicks have a bad, unsportmanslike attitude during play, and this is in no way dependent upon a particular rules set. So yes, the behaviours I'm talking about cannot be addressed through game design, which is what I've been saying. <br/>
<br/>
Jason's question suggested to me that he was talking about these behaviors and not specific unrest centered around a particular game design. If somebody has a problem with the way a game functions, that's not dickery. That's a game not suited to that player's tastes. If they use it as an excuse to disrupt play, then they're being a dick and you deal with it on the social level, not through the game system.<br/>
<br/>
We have been talking about two different things the entire time. One being actual dick behaviour, the other being dissatisfaction with a particular game design. I think that the two often blend together during play and that it's better to bring any suspicions up at the social level and find out what's going on and deal with it. If you want to handle a particular case by altering the rules structure, that's cool. But if the person is really a dick, it's only a band-aid on a larger problem.<br/>
<br/>
And no, I don't want to get into specific examples, because they're limitless and will just lead to a whole different mess of "did you mean this, or this, or this.." and so on.<br/>

                            I think the question is *somewhat* pointless. Some social issues can be addressed via rules just like some "game balance" issues can be addressed via rules. A massive spectrum probably can't. <br/>
<br/>
The solution is, as was noted in the first post, 'don't continue to play with those guys.'<br/>

                            People who are acting like dicks can be reformed, but only if the group can get together and confront the issue.  Some groups can accomplish this better with the help of certain kinds of rules systems.  Without that, the opportunity for reform may go unrealized.                        </div>

<p><code>A real dick will just find something else to be a dick about. Repeatedly, over and over.</code></p>
<p>Wow, that's ... that attitude doesn't mesh with my experience.  I'm not saying it's wrong, but I'll tell you why I have some trouble buying into it.</p>
<p>I used to encounter dicks in games all the time.  Heck, every other player I encountered was a dick!  I knew just how roleplaying ought to be, but all these <strong>dicks</strong> kept getting in the way, and it just sucked!</p>
<p>Over time I realized that I was going to have to learn to deal with even total dicks, because there just wasn't anyone else to roleplay with.  So I made a conscious effort to be open-minded, and to listen charitably, and to assume that they had some reason for what they were saying.  All the sort of stuff that lets you disarm total dicks, and make them at least moderately civil, so you can play with them.  Man, I was sneaky.</p>
<p>Well, it was all going for freakin' <em>nothing</em>, because the more I worked at being able to deal with dicks, the less the dicks showed up in my games.  The freaks had gone into hiding!  It was a conspiracy!  Even people I <em>knew for a fact</em> were dicks started acting as if they were reasonable people.  Man, it really pissed me off!</p>
<p>Luckily, I had <strong>evidence</strong>!  Some of the worst dickery had occurred to me in play-by-email games, and I kept scrupulous logs.  So when all of the dicks had vanished, and the only people I could find were reasonable, sensible people trying (sometimes imperfectly) to pursue the game ... well, I went back to my logs.  I just needed to be reminded of what dicks people could be.</p>
<p>The sons-of-bitches had <strong>altered</strong> my email logs!  Can you imagine!  When I read the same damn conversations, I sat there and nodded, and said to myself "Oh, hey, that person wasn't trying to be a dick, we were just having a really, really bad miscommunication and we both got angry."  I couldn't pin down any particular place where the words had changed, but all the dickishness had been leached from the exchanges!</p>
<p>Truly, the conspiracy of dickhood has tendrils that penetrate everywhere, from the highest levels of government to the lowliest email archives.  I realized that, unless I wanted to end up a victim of their almighty conspiracy, I'd just have to play along.  So I've convinced myself, over time, that the people I thought were dicks in the first place were <em>not</em> in fact dicks.  That their dickishness was at least in part an artifact of my perceptions.</p>
<p>And so, Chris, I read your posts and I see you saying "Well, you'll know a dick when you see one.  It's easy," and I can only shake my head.  Maybe you've got a magic power that makes that true for you, but it's really, really not true for me.</p>
<p>I can tell when someone's <em>actions</em> are causing trouble in a game.  But I have a really crummy track record in terms of knowing when someone's <em>attitude</em> is aimed at causing trouble in the game.  Every time I've been sure that someone was deliberately being a dick, it's turned out that I was at least on shaky ground, and often flat out wrong.</p>

                            Well, I don't encounter dicks all the time. And when I do think I've encountered one, I start a dialog to find out. And much of the time, there was no harm intended. But you know, some of time, that person turns out to have such a bad attitude that I'm not going to waste my time associating with them.<br/>
<br/>
You've read any 'magic power' into this. I've stated over and over that sincere communication on your (my, whoever) part is necessary to find out what's going on and deal with it. That's hardly magic. It's just outside the comfort zone of a lot of people apparently. So, I think I'm done repeating myself now.<br/>

                            Okay, let me try another tack.  Imagine the following progression:<br/>
<br/>
Start&gt; I'm not having fun.<br/>
Question 1&gt; Why am I not having fun?<br/>
Answer 1&gt; The way Bob is playing bothers me.<br/>
Question 2&gt; Does the way Bob is playing bother anyone else?<br/>
Answer 2&gt; The way Bob is playing bothers others.<br/>
Question 3&gt; Will Bob change the way he plays?<br/>
<br/>
Each of the questions in this list requires a form of communication.<br/>
<br/>
Question 1 is self-knowledge.  Not everyone has it.  Not everyone can identify what the source of their dissatisfaction is.  If dissatisfaction can have an in-game representation, some people will be able to identify it when they otherwise wouldn't.<br/>
<br/>
Question 2 is consensus building.  Not everyone can start it.  If dissatisfaction can have an in-game representation, consensus could, for some groups, be easier to reach.<br/>
<br/>
Question 3 is addressing the problem.  Once questions 1 and 2 are answered (and sometimes just question 1) question 3 can be addressed.<br/>
<br/>
Now some people need no help at all with questions 1 and 2.  Yay!  If you're one of those people, congratulations!  Good for you.  In a perfect gaming world, it might even be true that noone would need help with questions 1 and 2 (I'm not sure of this but the point is immaterial to this discussion).  <br/>
<br/>
The fact is, though, some groups DO need help with 1 and 2, and game mechanics can offer support to them.  Capes is one of the first games that I know of that attempts this, and I'm sure there are others.  The idea is too new, I think, for us to guage how effective mechanics can potentially be in this arena, but I don't think it's reasonable to say that there is NO need for them whatsoever.                        </div>

"To be clear: I've seen people be dicks by doing exactly what you're suggesting. I have seen (more than once) a player in an Amber Throne War say things like "How could you betray me! You're being such a dick! Are you trying to hurt my feelings?" By doing that they are clearly labelling behavior that would otherwise be expected in the game (i.e. betrayal and backstabbing) as dickery. <b>Those people, to borrow Andy's phrase, need to be punched in the cocks.</b>"<br/>
</i><br/>
<br/>
And then:<br/>

Truly, the conspiracy of dickhood has tendrils that penetrate everywhere, from the highest levels of government to the lowliest email archives.

Maybe I'll develop skills for dealing with them, later, and I'll then regret all the times I punched them in the cocks.  Probably not, though.  After all, they're dicks.<br>
<br>
EDIT:  More seriously, though ... such people need to be punched not because of their dickly intentions (which, who knows?) but because their behaviors are measurably fucking with what the game is about.  Punching them in the cocks is part of calmly and reasonably resolving the miscommunication.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

<p>Huh?  Passive aggressive whiny dickery dies a sudden and unmourned death if you play (for instance) Capes, My Life with Master or Dogs in the Vineyard ... a whole host of games, really.  The problem just curls up and dies, and the people doing it either step up or shut up.  I've seen it happen, many times.</p>
<p>Are you arguing that rules can't address this behavioral issue?  'cuz that's a much more pointed statement than just saying "Rules can't stop someone from being a dick in <em>some</em> way ... they'll always find a way."</p>

                            Hi!<br>
  Well, it seems like there is a spectrum, and you have to use different tools for different varieties:<br>
Accidental - Yeah, I think tight rules can help "prevent" that. But cannot stop it entirely. Communication and good group dynamics cna fix the rest.<br>
Mild - This is usually solved by communication. Some rules can solve this, like comic codes, etc. But past that, it's up to the group to fill in gaps in communications<br>
Total - These players are miserable and want people around them to be miserable. the only proper procedure is amputation. I've tried reaching out to these guys, but they are just too antisocial...<br>
  Well, that's my opinion anyway...                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            In my experience, the only reliable way to prevent dickery is to not play with dicks.<br>
<br/>
Otherwise, unless you're the Batman of rpg design, you'll just create rules that don't reliably stop dicks and that do frequently get in the way of non-dicks.  Maybe it's possible to produce counterdick rules that work without unpleasant side effects, but I've not seen any.<br/>
<br/>
Easier than that, I think, is just not to play with anyone that gets off on being a dog-in-the-manger.                        </br></div>

                            You can't stop anyone from doing anything. Ever. <br/><br/>You can, however, discourage specific people from doing specific things.

                            And... just because one method is most effective of a given array, doesn't mean that it can't also be used in combination with other methods. <br/><br/>This isn't an either/or binary, after all.<br/><br/>Of course, I'll add that I don't usually find rules that are ONLY aimed at dealing with dicks usefull. However a game that is built from the ground up to have a solid structure that allows one to help dicks not be dicks, or to show out those who insist on being dicks, are very wonderful things. <br/><br/>Its hard to hide as a dick in a game of Dogs, for example. Even harder in a game of Polaris. And both games also have ways of getting past a lot of the normal "dickery" of games -- because there are so many more ways for people to assertivly and constructivly contribute.                        </div>

                            I'm more of the thought that the general gist of the discussion is "How much does system matter for this one thing?"<br/><br/>Personally, I think there's too many levels of Being a Dick to address them all under "dickery":<br/><br/>Some folks just want to poke holes in the game because they've lost interest.<br/><br/>Some folks just want to poke holes in the game because they think others enjoy the distraction/silliness they provide.<br/><br/>Some folks want to get away with things (ie combat twinks) to maximize the rules to their advantage. And even here, some do it subconsciously, others do it with a "So, it's not what the game is supposed to be about, but it's in the rules, so deal!" sneer.<br/><br/>All in all, it comes down to rules-tightening, whether it be through a Golden "Don't be a dick" overarching rule, General rules that address this ("Veto" rules and the like), and then, of course, just tightening up the system so that it's so airtight that it's almost unbreakable.<br/><br/>Then there's the whole social aspect with others incl RN address: Social Agenda, group rules, whatever you call it: But maybe the game's rules can draw attention to that a little, with something like, "OK, so there's no rules saying "don't be a dick", but here's some guidelines that may help your group deal if someone is engaging in uncooperative behavior..."<br/><br/>I'd like to see solid examples of some of the above, namely:<br/><br/>1) Examples of systems that are so tight that dickery is mostly preventable (although we can agree that no game is 100% preventable).<br/><br/>2) Examples of games that give provocative examples or demonstrations of how a group can manage its social environment to assist in avoiding dickery.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Andy, I think I addressed <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> in the Roach.  When bullshit is called on narration, you go immediately to resolving the conflict, no further discussion, which serves two purposes - it ends any lingering dickery in the moment, and it propels the game on to a new scene and conflict that renders previous dickery more or less moot.  This is as much social as mechanical, and self-corrects dickery a bit.  In play it is rarely invoked.  <br/><br/>I'd argue that Dogs approaches <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, since the system is tightly constrained but flexible enough to roll with most dickery attempts involving traits, stats, and relationships.  They end up not being dickery at all, just boring.                        </div>

By taking it out of the game level, and threatening to beat someone up over what his fictional character did, you broke the social contract.  The players apparently hadn't agreed that such immoral actions were out of bounds for PCs, and were appalled by your threat.  <br/><br/>It seems to me that this could have gone much more smoothly if instead you established an in-game rule which prevented such behavior.  For example, I believe Capes has a "comics code" which is agreed on at the start by the players.  You could use a codified system like Brian Gleichman's <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.frp.advocacy/msg/c5bef83ba7b47f86?hl=en&amp;lr=" rel="nofollow"><b>Interaction Model of Campaign Morality</b></a>.                        </div>

I think even if you're seeing the problem right at the beginning, it's better to step out of the game. The first time the guy rapes someone, call a halt and say "Hey, I know we didn't talk about it beforehand, but I was hoping for a more heroic game." or something like that. Notice that you also accept some fault for not stating your desires up front.<br/>
<br/>
Adding a new rule to say "You can't do that anymore." is a passive agressive move. It will blow up just as badly, or worse. At least if you step out to the social contract level, people might be more receptive to not thinking you're a dick.<br/>
<br/>
But in the rape and subsequent threat of violence case, I think Ross was out of line. Even if he didn't tell us about the 20 times before that when he tried to convince the other guy not to rape. And it's no surprise the game fell apart.<br/>

<i>It seems to me that this could have gone much more smoothly if instead you established an in-game rule which prevented such behavior. For example, I believe Capes has a "comics code" which is agreed on at the start by the players.

In specific, though, I can imagine many cases where it simply doesn't solve one or the both problems.<br/><br/>1. In the case where the person asking for boundaries does not think to exclude PC rape of others it is still, IMO, legitimate to kick the person out (I'm sure people will disagree--such is the Internet). I can see the appalled player going "We covered this!" and the other guy saying "We said no *explicit* sexual stuff! I'm totally cool!"<br/><br/>2. If the group is so tightly bound to the idea that exclusion is wrong then I don't think kicking the person out will be acceptable even if they do violate the rule: I'm not sure why that would matter.<br/><br/>It's important to note that there is a *whole lot* of spectrum here (as people have said) from the "guy who's a dick because of a misunderstanding" to "the guy who's repuslive and needs to be punched in the nuts [metaphorically, we hope]."<br/><br/>It can be conjectured there's no real difference--but I think it's pretty clear that the spectrum still exists and the methodologies of dealing with the issue varry accordingly.<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>

<p>You know, there's a little aphorism that's been floating around the relationship advice world for a while now, and I think it's apparent that it applies to a role playing table just as well: <em>the common factor in all of your failed relationships is you.</em></p>
<p>If you've been gaming with a bunch of dicks, then maybe, just maybe, there's something wrong at your table.</p>
<p>In the original post about Once Upon a Time there was the glimmer of a really interesting observation: OUAT has a really incoherent ruleset.  At once it says two contradictory things.</p>
<ol>
<li>This is a game.  The object is to win.  You can win by following these rules and applying them the best.</li>
<li>You will only win by the consent of the other players, who also want to win.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's kind of the crux of the "dirty hippy" aspect of OUAT.  It presents itself as a game, and that your incentive is to win.  Then it makes the winning essentially arbitrary - which disconnects the activity from the incentive.</p>
<p>In fact, there's a strict division I've learned about board and card games in general.  There are games that actually are about winning, and the a win is acheived by "best" play, and there are games where there's a winner, but the winner is chosen essentially arbitrarily.  Approaching either as the other is a receipe for a bad time.</p>
<p>Honestly, I really tend to think of the latter, more hippy games as being more "activities."  Because you play a game to win, and you participate in an activity just to have fun.  The trappings of winning are largely unimportant.</p>

<p>judson, tangentially:</p>
<p>I don't consider that incoherent. Superficially, it's a contradiction, but in fact, it is setting responsibility on the players' shoulders - that is, the reponsibility to recognise and reward good play. I don't think that this is necessarily problematic for games the way you seem to imply, nor do I think that the winner is arbitrary in these sorts of games. There is <em>absolutely</em> a standard for good play, and the winner adheres most closely to this standard.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if this ought to be spun off into it's own thread - it seems quite tangential to more recent posts, but to realte pretty strongly to the original post.</p>
<p>Shreyas,</p>
<p>I used the word incoherent pretty intentionally, although not as it would be defined at the Forge, obviously.  A mere contradiction could be resolved, but I've felt like the OUAT rules are fairly incoherent, in that OUAT is framed as a game, and the nominal aim of any game is to win.  However, integral to the rules as written is that any play you make must be approved by the other players.</p>
<p>So, if it's a game, and we're all trying to win, why would I allow anyone a turn?</p>
<p>Now, obviously, OUAT gets played.  I've played it, and had fun.  But I think the only way that you can play is by ignoring the idea that your aim is to win, even though a number of the rules rely on that assumption.  As human beings, we can shift our understanding around and make them work.</p>
<p>In short, we have to recognize, <em>a priori,</em> that the object of OUAT isn't to win, but to have fun, but that to have fun we need to play <em>as if</em> we were trying to win <em>unless</em> that wouldn't be fun.  So we play our cards and tell a good story, because we're trying to win.  But we don't arbitrarily vote our opponents out of an ending, or even a card play, because that wouldn't be fun.</p>

The way you win OUAT, is by being so incredibly entertaining with your storytelling, that the other people forget that they're playing a game, or else sublimate that knowledge so that you can keep telling the story.                        </div>

<p>Vaxalon,</p>
<p>Point well taken.  But see:</p>
<p>Shreyas,</p>
<p>I think we may be looking at slightly different aspects of OUAT as a game.  As played, OUAT as one thing, but it's necessarily different than OUAT as written.  As written, it's a game, and the object is to win, and the way you win is that you empty your hand by using the cards you've got as story elements and end your story.  Both the play of your cards and your ending must be approved by the other players.  If they withhold approval, you retreive your card and play passes to the next player.  A purely winning-oriented strategy would entail challenging every card play, and every proposed ending.</p>
<p>When you play OUAT, in order to have fun, you suppress the win-oriented strategy.  And in practice, most people do this very well, and OUAT has been a lot of fun whenever I've played it (although I suspect I could get exhausted of it very quickly.)  But the game as written does have that as a conflict, as I see it.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to get at is an idea about establishing incentives in line with the premises of the game.  I'm suggesting that a lot of the trouble that I've seen in games of OUAT revolve <em>not</em> around players who are dicks, but instead in the muddled objectives of the game, which is summed up in "if I want to win, why would I vote for your ending?"</p>

                            Hmm.  In my experience, long and entertaining storytelling isn't very effective at winning OUAT.  You're unlikely to get rid of your cards quickly that way.  I've seen a lot of players go on with their story for a while and not get rid of their cards, only to be defeated by someone who quickly sums up their cards in a single plot twist and ends the game.  <br/>
<br/>
What OUAT rewards is being able to get rid of your cards quickly.  This rewards being able to put elements together into a coherent storyline.  It doesn't reward making a particularly *good* story.  In my experience, it's difficult to make a good story in the game, in the sense of a narrative that's interesting to read written.  <br/>
<br/>
Getting back to talking about penises, I think there are some points about what is appropriate to handle with the rules versus handling outside of the game rules.  I think <br/>
<br/>
A few comments on how to decide this: <br/>
1) In the Forge Lumpley Principle sense, the "System" is whatever is used to determine the fictional content.  So if you have a problem with, say, a game character raping someone, then this problem is on the system level.  It can be addressed within the written rules or outside of them -- but it is at the system level.  <br/>
<br/>
2) Dickery can extend beyond the system.  On the other hand, rules can extend beyond the system as well.  The rules of a game can refer to where people are sitting, who is the oldest, whether they are standing up or sitting down, or anything like that.  <br/>
<br/>
In general, if there is disagreement and anyone is thinking of other people as dicks, I think it's usually better to talk about it but also have support within the rules, rather than solely freeform negotiation.  But I'm open to views either way about this.                        </div>

In my experience, players who were able to entrance the rest of the players with their storytelling could sneak their cards onto the table calmly and nonthreateningly.  "Let me put this card down, and I'll keep telling the story; if you challenge, I stop, and you won't hear the rest of what I have to say right now."                        </div>

<p>This is obviously Andy's job to decide, but personally I think it's kosher to ask for spinoff threads, or start them yourself.</p>

<p>My take: start a spinoff thread, post a link to it from here, sure.  But just because you started a thread doesn't make it yours to end, seems to me.  If people still have something to say about Dickery (or even just dick jokes), this is as good a place to post it as any.</p>
