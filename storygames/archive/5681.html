It went pretty well, but not as well as I had hoped.  But that's ok.  I had set my hopes pretty high.  The good news is I think I have identified the issues well enough to address them.</p>\n<p><strong>The first issue</strong><br/>\nMy prepared material wasn't as bang-y as I thought it would be.  I had some cool setting color and bits of situation, but the characters weren't tied to the situation.  I had a treasure and a monster that were interesting, but had nothing to do with the quests the characters were on.  Which was a shame, because if I had thought about it for just half a second, it would have been an easy thing to do.  A little bit of the tMW fishing-exercise and the story would have been about the characters.  Oh well.  Lession learned.  The GM's instructions notes that I have will improve.</p>\n<p>The issue became obvious after the first full chapter (which took about two hours) when Mark started getting this sour look on his face.  I asked him what was up, and, once he was able to put his finger on it, he decided that he wanted more player input into the setting.  He authored in some monsters for us to encounter next and started feeling the love again.  He didn't specifically mention the tMW fishing exercise, but I think that would have brought the fun to him as well, or better than, the opportunity to describe some monsters.</p>\n<p><strong>The Second Issue</strong><br/>\nThere was some imbalance in the combat scenes that led to a bit of not-fun.  Or, to be more accurate, the fun-o-meter dropped to an unacceptable level.</p>\n<p>In the first combat, the PCs went up against one really tough demon-dinosaur with seven eyes.  The characters had tracked it down as the thing that had stolen a very important and very valuable statue.  It was a cool and tense fight, but for a few moments seemed too quick.  Possibly, a bit inevitable.  The monster had Very Heavy weapons (it's size was 6), so it's base damage was three.  One of the PCs also had a Very Heavy weapon, so when he hit, he was dishing out big damage too.</p>\n<p>In the second combat, the PCs fought two full-fledged monsters and a dozen mooks. The monsters had only two powers each, but they still ended up being a little overpowered for the PCs.  The mooks never got any damage in, but I was able to use them to chase the PCs around the arenas to give the monsters a better chance to attack.  After one player went down and the other flubbed an important roll, they decided it was time to retreat.</p>\n<p>In the third and final combat of the night, I decided I wanted to figure out exactly why the last combat was so tough.  I included three NPC demon-dudes and a half-dozen of the mooks from the previous fight.  This turned out to be the worst combat of the night, bar none.  There was a huge drawn out amount of time where there was nothing but maneuvering and whiffing.  The NPCs had so many HP between the lot of them that the PCs couldn't whittle them down fast enough, but neither could the NPCs muster the ability to get enough awesome tokens to kill off both the PCs.  It just dragged on.  Eventually the combat came down to a single roll on the part of the player, and what should have been a really tense moment was just a relief knowing that it was over.  Suck.</p>\n<p>(continued)</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127128/#Comment_127128" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-17T06:46:40+00:00" title="February 17, 2008  6:46AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 17, 2008 6:47AM by Eric Provost.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p><strong>Combat Issue Conclusions</strong><br/>\nThere was a lot going on that kept the combat issues from being easy to identify and easy to fix, but I think I do have some solutions.</p>\n<p>The first is that no weapon can have a base damage of three anymore.  When I first came up with the HP scale the weapons did one or sometimes two and rarely three damage (by way of the Face Die).  I think returning to that constant will help.  That'll mean altering the advantages that Heavy and Very Heavy weapons have.  I'm not sure where I'm going to go with it yet, but I'm confident that tightening the damage scale will make me happier.</p>\n<p>The second, and possibly easier solution, is to increase the amount of damage output in relation to the amount of HP an enemy has.  When an enemy has lots of HP and not much ability to hurt the PCs, then we just sit there and wait for the inevitable to happen, which can take way too long.  Aaaand... that probably just means playing the NPCs and mooks just a little bit smarter than I was.  I played that last combat a little too reactively.  I should have been proactive, built up my tokens, and finished off the PCs as soon as possible.  I had a really neat idea about what might happen if both the PCs were knocked out, and I should have just gotten on with it.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Those issues aside, we three really did have a good time.  I'm looking forward to next weekend when I'll have a better set of GM notes and instructions.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127132/#Comment_127132" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-17T07:18:47+00:00" title="February 17, 2008  7:18AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Eric - you mentioned that you hadn't had a ton of chances to play the conflict / danger mechanics - how did that go?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127145/#Comment_127145" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-17T08:44:52+00:00" title="February 17, 2008  8:44AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I thought it went pretty well.

Because it's by correcting these issues that the game will be even better than it is now.<br/><br/>I am curious about the GM advice that you will write because I am only mildly acquainted with tMW and don't know the "fishing-exercise" you spoke about.<br/><br/>About the combat issue conclusion, I think your first solution is realy good. I prefer the damage the weapons did in the first edition of the game. I think it's more in line with the PCs' and monsters' number of hit points. Raising the number of hit points does not seem like the good option for the reasons you told : mostly, that the combat tend to drag on boringly until it stops boringly too.<br/>Together with the "yari master fix" you published on your blog, I think it would resolve all the combat problems I had. Perhaps the 3 damage weapons should be only for the "Mighty grip" talent and don't combine with other types (as it is now the "very heavy reach weapon" is realy realy STRONG).<br/><br/>That's realy great !

If you're subtle about using it, you can totally make a story all about the PCs without any prep at all.  It goes something like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Introduce a minor story element.</li>\n<li>Pick a player and ask them a question about that story element.  The answer to that question should forge a relationship between the PC and the element.</li>\n<li>Immediately use that relationship to spur the player into action.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<p>GM - "You're walking through the baron's estate when you see a painting you recognize.  In fact, you know the artist.  Who is the artist?"<br/>\nPlayer - "Oh, well it was my sister.  She's a famous painter and sells these things to nobility all the time."<br/>\nGM - "Well, as you take a moment to appreciate one of your sister's works, you notice something a little distrubing.  Her signature has been removed!  And replaced with the baron's signature!  What do you want to do about that?"</p>\n<p>And check out these two important things:  It doesn't matter how tightly connected to the PC the artist was.  The player could have picked anyone and it would have been cool.  But it has been my experience that players love to weave these things as tightly as they can.  Also, even if the player decides that his character will ignore the situation, something cool has happened.  We know more about the character by knowing more about their past and how they react to such things.</p>\n<p>Even when the fishing technique doesn't provide instant action, it does go a long way toward connecting the PCs to the story.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antoine_F" title="Antoine_F"><img alt="Antoine_F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antoine_F">Antoine_F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127277/#Comment_127277" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-18T09:05:33+00:00" title="February 18, 2008  9:05AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Eric,<br/><br/>I did not know this technique and it seems very useful.

If you're facing someone with a heavy weapon, you have some sort of disadvantage (it's scary!). Maybe especially if you're using a light or ranged weapon.<br/><br/>2. Heavy weapons don't necessarily do more damage, but they _hurt a lot_ and leave you stunned. Being hit by a heavy weapon makes you Dazed.
