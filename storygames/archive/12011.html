Problem is, the wizard can hunt for this sort of achievement as well, unless you specifically make it a fighting-man privilege - which I totally would!<br><br>It's an age-old complaint of D&amp;D that wizards actually get all the cool stuff. This is true, and the game needs to be specifically modified to either make the stuff others get cool or to give them something new and cool. (Not meaning that this has to be done, mind; insofar as I understand it, some appreciate how wizards are both more complex and more interesting to play, giving the different classes different levels of mechanical engagement. Presumably you'll play a fighter or some such if you want to focus on the fiction and not worry about the rules too much.)<br/><br/>In fact, I'm not even joking about that Witcher thing, now that I think of it. I could well imagine that if I had this wizard problem (which I don't, as my game doesn't operate out of character identity and niche nearly so much), I'd certainly make celibacy a precondition for magic power - one less effective caster level per "encounter", say. Then just give out lots of naughty postcards to the fighters and thieves and whatnot. The fact that they don't do anything in particular makes their nature as rewards all the more substantial. While the wizard gets a spell-book, at least the non-wizards will always have their memories...                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tavis" title="Tavis"><img alt="Tavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tavis">Tavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269267/#Comment_269267" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-28T05:38:32+00:00" title="April 28, 2010  5:38AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 28, 2010 5:39AM by Tavis.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good point about magic-users getting the cool stuff.

The fighter is not significant for what he is himself, but for what he's managed to steal from the other character's niche. It just seems to make more sense for the wizard, who makes the sword, to be the real power behind the magicswordocracy that rules the coop than for the poor flunky who wields it.<br><br>If one reads "silver age" D&amp;D stuff that tends to be deeply concerned with this sort of thematic balance between character classes, an usual solution seems to be to presume that the wizard is necessarily a social pariah of sorts - the non-magical types remain viable and interesting as foci of power because they are mighty warlords with armies and nations at their beck and call. For some reason this isn't available to wizards so much. I have to say that I've no trouble with the idea that you pay for your magic with social exclusion, and the thematic answer to why not all heroes and villains are wizards is that there is power in the coordinated society of perfectly mundane people as well.<br><br>Then there is the 4th edition theme, which seems to be that nobody is really that powerful - personal power is always purely tactical in nature, and martial characters have just as much of it as arcane ones. I'm a big advocate of non-arcane ritual magic in that game, incidentally, exactly because I want to support character concepts that do not rely on magic for their protagonism. It's not that difficult to make a ritual of "Buying Cheap" with material component of "marketplace" and time-frame of "a couple of hours", after all. Just the same logic that powerization of tactical action goes through in that game.<br><br>Of course all this only makes sense if you're interested in the theme of supernatural vs. natural world to begin with. It's a pretty common topic in fantasy literature and such, which is why there's many of us who obsess about it, but it's still quite feasible to just ignore the thematic subtext and look strictly at the rules: as long as your rules say that only the fighter can use the magic sword, it sort of makes sense that it doesn't matter that it's a "magic" sword. Could just as well be "Exotic Weapon" sword that has those bonuses to hit, and it'd have the same mechanical meaning, more or less. Going that way, though, perhaps I'd simply rename all the non-magical classes: if the class is called "magicsworder" instead of "fighter", then there is no thematic incongruity in him gaining his power from mastery of magical tools. In fact, it'd be easy to justify giving the "magicsworder" class plenty of other magic item utilization skills as well - you could just go through the list of utility magic items and declare most of them "magicsworder" specialties due to how they require highly trained spatial senses, reflexes and such to avoid cutting yourself into pieces. The "magicsworder" would thus be sort of like a fighter pilot of the magical world - very prestigious and not at all secondary to the people who build the tools he uses; in fact, the tools he uses are so challenging that only his exceptional personal qualities allow him to use them in the first place.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tavis" title="Tavis"><img alt="Tavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tavis">Tavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269276/#Comment_269276" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-28T08:02:01+00:00" title="April 28, 2010  8:02AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think "fighter pilot of the magical world" captures what I like about it, especially since I'm fond of Appendix N literary inspirations in which all magic is really technology anyway. I'd want to insist on it being a "magical" sword so that I could use the existing definitions of what magic can do; in making martial powers and practices for 4th Edition I'm often frustrated by the conflict between wanting to give the fighter equally cool stuff and wanting to "keep it real" (and feel that the wizard suffers from not being allowed to do super-natural stuff that's beyond tactical).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I also like the idea that the fighter's unique power comes from the ability to command lots of men-at-arms. (To make this playable at the same level of detail as a wizard's fireballs, it'd be nice to have a streamlining rule like "for every five level 1 men-at-arms in a combat, treat them as one L3 fighting man / add +3 to hit and +5 damage to their commander's attack / whatever is mathematically equivalent to the likely increase in combat effectiveness that these guys contribute). You could keep clerics a half-way class by saying that their legions of followers are also clerics and can't use missile weapons; going by my experience with Chainmail, the fighting man's ability to command archery-enabled units will confer a sizable advantage.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my campaign, though, the charm person spell means that the magic-users more often wind up commanding troops in dungeon expeditions because they don't care if a charmed gnoll dies; even the fighting men who want to amass armies tend to leave their followers at home because they care about them as people. (This is a problem only insofar as it means they impact the game at different levels - the gnoll won't get sent to appeal to the King for aid - and insofar as it's harder to make gnolls into people that the players care about.)<br/>\n<br/>\nTo try to keep this on track: having a roster of followers would also make a good handout; when the dwarves encountered in the dungeon pledge fealty, bam! you get a booklet with their names, hit points, little details, etc. A random generator like <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://redvan.wikidot.com/hireling-generator" rel="nofollow">this one</a> would make it easy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269278/#Comment_269278" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-28T08:33:38+00:00" title="April 28, 2010  8:33AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I like this propping thing.

You see, there are no explicit a priori spell mechanics, even if there are spells, so having a prop book for spells would come useful for notes on what a spell does.
