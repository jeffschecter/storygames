Running a session on Saturday night using dice (everything from d4 to d20), and instead of Resolution Cards, I'm making a table that the players have to roll on. You know, like damage. "You rolled a 4? That's a Yes, But. Let's see what the table says..."<br/><br/>I'll be playing a Wolven Ranger with a magic axe.<br/><br/>The players will roll to see who wins a fight: so if there's a verbal altercation, or a brawl, each player rolls. High roll wins, and then the winner chooses the Yes table or the No table, then rolls randomly (depending on what the player wants the outcome to be).<br/><br/>Since some of the Yes results will be Yes, But or Yes, And, there's no way of knowing how things will shake out. Should be fun.<br/><br/>I'm thinking that I'll print a map up before hand, or maybe paint one, on a large piece of posterboard. Then I'll use minis to keep track of where characters are, and each 'turn', a character can move up to two positions. That will restrict which characters can participate in a given scene, forcing players to use different characters in each round. Theoretically. We shall see how it goes!\ufeff<br/><br/>As for the dice, you've got a pool of six dice in front of you, and each time you want to do something, you roll one of those dice. Each time you do, it's used up. After they're all used up, you keep rolling d4 as the default whenever there's a conflict. You roll against another player when there's a conflict, so a d20 is probably going to win against a d4 (though there's always a chance!). The idea is, you've got two powerful moves, two medium, and two weak (one of which, the d4, can be used over and over again). So you have to decide how to approach each conflict, since you don't know what the other player is going to be rolling.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381242/#Comment_381242" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-07T12:32:12+00:00" title="June  7, 2012 12:32PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 7, 2012 12:32PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is bananas and an affront to all that is clean and good about the gentle game Archipelago.

It's the equivalent to stuttering when telling the punchline of a joke.

So we joust, you throw a 20, I throw a 6, you win, then I keep your 20?<br/>What kind of metagame emerges?Basically, the metagame (maybe wrong word?) is that one has to decide if something is important enough to risk their best die or a very good die, to roll it. Further, if you do it via blind bidding (i.e., we each hide our die in our hand, then reveal simultaneously) I might wonder if you will lowball (especially if you know I haven't lost my 20 yet) and so maybe I roll my d12 instead.<br/><br/>And failure (say I roll my 20 and lose) gets somewhat mitigated because I don't lose my die AND I get an extra 6 from you. And, notice that victory carries a real, mechanical price now--not as harsh as your original "it's gone forever" method, but also not as limited in terms of how many rolls a given person can make (that aren't suck-ass d4s). Plus, you get the classic "hero's arc" built right in: I lose tons of rolls, then--WHAM--I can come out swinging with d20 and d12 stacks.<br/><br/>(aside)-----<br/>You could make this die passing mechanic work just fine with your dice-to-trait assignment mechanic by merely stating that one can't use a die size higher than the "original" or "base" die size when one evokes a trait. SO you win my 20... but you can only use it if you evoke your d20 trait. Perhaps I will maneuver in the fiction to make it a very tricky (or a "that's bullshit, man") evocation.<br/>(/aside)-----<br/><br/>The metagame, then, is more about literal player versus player (not PCvPC!), tracking dice used and dice passed, bluffing: nothing to do with <i>character </i>positioning in the fiction (necessarily).<br/>...<br/>Get Thor to whisper his idea to you. (Thor, why did you whisper? Worried it was off-topic?)<br/><br/>...<br/>In closing, I'd also say that one can always use the d4 for any trait (or, alternately, maybe <i>only </i>one's <i>last </i>d4 is this flexible?). Otherwise, you can get to a point where ever problem looks like a nail (or has to be described as one, with much shoehorning!) and all you've got is a broken hammer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381401/#Comment_381401" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-08T07:39:20+00:00" title="June  8, 2012  7:39AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2012 7:29PM by thor.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes it felt off topic but for those who want to know<br/><br/>My thought was that your character starts with 4 dice 1D8, 2D6, and 1D4. <br/>Then each turn you roll for success. <br/>1-3 = "No, And..." + swap your die for a D12<br/>4-6 = "No, But..." + swap your die for a D8<br/>7-9 = "Yes, But..." + swap your die for a D6<br/>10-12 = "Yes, And..." + keep your die.<br/><br/>I like this enough that I have moved it to Praxis                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381408/#Comment_381408" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-08T08:05:15+00:00" title="June  8, 2012  8:05AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, it's definitely taking things further afield than his original "rolloff" die system. That said, he IS posting a die mechanic in Make Stuff: it's our moral imperative to modify it!<br/><br/>...<br/>I guess I'll take this post to add something I was assuming was obvious: one can always opt to use a smaller die than one's "base" or "original" die type for a trait. So, even though you evoke "Scornful Denigration"--which I know you have at d12--you might still throw a d6, to lowball, so you don't lose the d12 if you roll highest.<br/><br/>Hmmm... which means your weaker, d6 trait is hamstrung, should you win with the d6 you "borrowed" from it to lowball your d12 trait: You *could* have rolled a d6 when you evoke it later in play, but you lost that d6 while underbidding a d12 trait. So now the d6 trait's best evocation is d4 (until you win a d6 again).<br/><br/>Um... yeah... not sure if that's a good emergent system or not.

Then you hold up your character sheet and say, Scornful Denigration is my d8 power, and the other guy says, aha, well, my Withering Glare is d20, and then you roll and see how it shakes out. So yep, you're going to be blind-bidding, in a sense.<br/><br/>Mainly, I'm wondering about the "give your winning die to the losing player." Because this means that you're never going to run out -- you're going to have three d20s in play, on three different character sheets (or maybe the same one!) through the whole game. So you won't ever have a situation where you run out of big dice, and it's just a bunch of d4s and d6s -- and that one sneaky guy who held on to his d20 until the very end.

I've got brain damage from playing games where we all know everyone's sheets pretty well. It's been a while since I had "secret stats" on a character sheet! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rafael</cite>You know what I mean?</blockquote>Well, sure, but you get the inverse with die elimination: a character can only be effective in five conflicts, then it's rolling d4s forever. Are you intentionally trying to make a fixed duration of play like that? And what about scope/scale? That is: am I going to run through half my dice in one scene, or will it be more on the scale of a single die a scene?<br/><br/>Do you have some notion of "die refresh"? That could mitigate.<br/>...<br/>As for "a guy with three d20s"--sure, but he can ONLY evoke one of them with his original d20 trait, not just any old trait. So he'd have to be fictionally positioned to use that trait (and can be maneuvered away from its use). Hmmm... or maybe you could have something like a fallout mechanic: the die you win with also is rolled to see how much the trait you used "bites you back". You win with Scornful Denigration, but roll shit on the fallout, then others around you think you're being a jerk (or, conversely, think I'm being some kind of poseur, acting like a mere stare is "withering"!).<br/><br/>That way, you have a sort of two-roll situation:<br/>* You v me, to resolve conflict<br/>* Winner's fallout, to see how those outside of the immediate conflict saw things.<br/><br/>---<br/>Anyhow... just chucking out ideas! Maybe the "six rolls and done" thing is perfect for A2...?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
