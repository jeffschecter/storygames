It could even be complete nonsense. I've been warned.</b><br/><br/>Most of my design work consists of testing single rule 'nanosystems', one of which is the following: Characters are described as a series of premises, and are given a chance to <i>react</i> whenever a situation arises which would disprove or contradict those premises. So for example, if you have 'Fast as a Bullet', then if someone states that a normal person running has caught up to you, you can roll to counter such a statement. Basically, it's all about testing premises, and discovering they exist through attempting actions which contradict them.<br/><br/>So far so good, except we run into trouble when we use premises which can't be disproven, like 'God is watching over me', or aren't well defined, like 'I will not harm the innocent' (but what is considered innocent?), or deal with internal states, like 'my girlfriend hates me'. And the reason I'm concerned with this is because the system breaks down when you cannot test a premise.<br/><br/>But then it occurs to me that this issue already exists in RPGs, it's just simply ignored because the players have already made assumptions about things. It's the reason the existence of the Invisible Choir is accepted in Unknown Armies (despite the lack of 'facts' to support it), and Vampire players are more willing to accept Supernatural vs Scientific explanations (which results in a lot of fun on my part).<br/><br/>But where this really gets important is in mysteries, and since all RPGs are mysteries this is really important. If you can't <i>test</i> or <i>assume</i> a premise, you can't have a mystery, and so much is possible and assumable in your typical fantasy setting that you're left with very little you can actually test (no thanks to my 7th level spell "Destroy Physical Evidence"), but honestly I'd love to be able to defeat a dragon by taking a series of actions to discover HOW to do so.<br/><br/>And it's not as simple as just making perception skill checks, but that's another whole discussion. Questions are great when you already have a working model of things and a set of axioms and assumptions to draw on, but those things cannot be expanded upon without experimentation. Which reminds me, I've yet to find an RPG that has any decently engaging experimentation rules either.<br/><br/>Finally, I'm well aware of formal logic and the issue of proof. You can't prove pigs can't fly, only show that they haven't yet. So the final sticky issue is how much is <i>enough</i> evidence for <i>proofieness</i>? I'd love to be able to numerically rate a premise in how <i>proven</i> it is, but what would be the best way to do so?<br/><br/>And ultimately, I'd like such a system to eliminate the issue of 'metagaming' with information the character cannot know by making it 'unimportant', and give the player the chance to engage their own logic skills in play.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham" title="MJGraham"><img alt="MJGraham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nEPVXFCEJAK2O.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham">MJGraham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395044/#Comment_395044" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-27T06:28:25+00:00" title="October 27, 2012  6:28AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 27, 2012 1:30PM by MJGraham.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Internal states are easy to deal with.
