Eight years ago it went through a complete overhaul for an expanded print version. I've played it a fair amount - straight (i.e., with trollbabes), with vampires, with Greek demi-gods, and in an acid-rain swept Heavy Metal apocalypse where desert tribal warriors ride giant battle insects. <br/><br/>I think a lot about this game, and I come back to it over and over again, because it seems to me as a kind of prototype of every Story Now RPG. It's like that scene in Alien vs. Predator where they dig down under Antarctica and discover an ancient temple with writing that contains glyphs from all of the most ancient human cultures, even though those cultures were separated by thousands of miles and years. <br/><br/>I also think that it has a crippling lack of internal consistency. I know lots of people have played this game over the years with success, and I conclude that that means they must have - consciously or unconsciously - repaired the incoherent mess I'm about to describe. So, if you played Trollbabe (or still do!) did you notice this stuff? What did you do about it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/paganini" title="paganini"><img alt="paganini" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/paganini">paganini</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464823/#Comment_464823" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-15T22:09:14+00:00" title="July 15, 2017 10:09PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ORIENTATION<br/><br/>I'm working from the 2009 expanded (107 page) print version of Trollbabe. In particular, the section titled "Conflicts Within Scenes," which starts on page 30 and runs through page 39. In case you haven't played Trollbabe, but are still interested, (or maybe you just need a refresher), here are the rules I'm talking about.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Trollbabe" rel="nofollow">Trollbabe</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>1. <br/><br/>Conflict: any incompatible interest among characters; it must be resolved by applying the rules of the game. Any person involved in play may call for a Conflict during a Scene. (glossary)<br/><br/>...a conflict is a crisis-point among characters and what they perceive as their interests. By definition, they disagree to the point where no compromise is possible, and the tension has risen to the point where harm may possibly be done. (pg. 29)<br/><br/>(Conflicts) arise when major disagreements and risks appear among characters... (pg. 30)<br/><br/>Conflicts are about characters. Specifically, about whether a character takes action to get what he or she wants, potentially to the detriment of someone else or counter to someone else's desires. (pg. 30)<br/><br/>...anyone with a character in a scene may declare that a conflict has arisen; no one else in the group may over-ride that declaration. Once declared, the conflict *will* be resolved using dice.(pg. 32)<br/><br/>...if harm is being done, then it has to be a conflict. And conversely, and more subtly, when a conflict is called even if little seems to be going on, then harm may well be done. (pg. 33)<br/><br/>The system is about conflicts of interest among the characters in the scene, not accounting for any imagined action that occurs throughout the setting. If dice are going to be rolled concerning the apple in the tree, then it\u2019s because the trollbabe is facing some kind of crisis situation about it, whether fighting someone, dealing with some direct or indirect magical context, or grappling with a social complication. All such conflicts entail the possibility of failure and the assumption of risk, \u201cassumption\u201d meaning \u201cto take upon oneself.\u201d If that\u2019s not the case, then she easily climbs the tree and eats the apple, and there\u2019s no conflict. (pg. 38)<br/><br/>Which person calls the conflict does matter, because he or she is the one who identifies its Action Type. Along with the trollbabe's Goal, that's how conflicts get defined in game terms. (pg. 33)<br/><br/>Difficulty is not a problem for trollbabes; if a human can do it at all, or almost, then a trollbabe can do it well. Anything harder than that, she can't do. You'll have to put aside traditional role-playing standards for what is and is not certain about a situation's outcome - nearly all uncertain situations in role-playing which [sic] do not involve other characters, e.g. whether the trollbabe can or cannot hop a fence or break a door, are certain in Trollbabe. She can or she cannot, and if she cannot, that's one hell of a fence or door, far beyond the capabilities of any imaginable character. (pg. 30)<br/><br/>2. <br/><br/>Action Type: the means by which the trollbabe character is dealing with a given conflict - Fighting, Magic, or Social. Action Type is determined by the person who declares the conflict. (glossary)<br/><br/>Fighting: an Action Type that is employed for damaging, restraining, or otherwise physically affecting an opponent using force. See the text for permissible Goals using this Action Type. (glossary)<br/><br/>Magic: an Action Type that is employed when marshalling [ sic ] arcane forces, whether human or trollish, mystical or scholarly. See the text for permissible Goals using this Action Type. (glossary)<br/><br/>Social: an Action Type that is employed when influencing others' behavior, including but not limited to negotiation and communication. See the text for permissible Goals using this Action type. (glossary)<br/><br/>The person who initiated the conflict also states its Action Type. (pg. 34)<br/><br/>In (the Fighting Action Type) the trollbabe must try to subdue, incapacitate, or out-and-out kill someone. (pg. 34)<br/><br/>Fighting means you're gonna have to hurt him or kill him, or subdue him so harshly that you might as well have hurt him. (pg. 34)<br/><br/>(The Magic Action Type is) flexible instead of constrained, leisurely rather than immediate. Although it can be used to kill or incapacitate someone, it can also gain information, provide a means of travel somewhere, send or receive an object, save or rescue someone, control others' behavior, alter the physical features of a situation, or communicate with someone. (pg. 34)<br/><br/>(The Magic Action Type) takes time; it's not an "action scene" type of thing. ...by definition (when selecting the Magic Action Type) you're saying that the trollbabe has plenty of time to prepare and not be bothered. (pg. 35)<br/><br/>(The Social Action Type) is used to inspire, lead, convince, bargain for advantage, reassure, terrify, attract, intimidate, establish commitment, or gain information. Its key feature is that it changes others' active behavior. Hitting a person using Fighting won't do that; it'll just beat him up. (pg. 35)<br/><br/>3. <br/><br/>Goal: a character's intended purpose during a conflict, stated by each player for his or her trollbabe character. (glossary)<br/><br/>(A Goal is) her desired outcome - that's right, her point of view, speaking as a fictional character in that moment. ...It's an outcome, stated very generally, as the trollbabe desires it at that moment. (pg. 35)<br/><br/>A Goal is always a positive achievement, stated positively and transitively. (pg. 36)<br/><br/>NPCs do not have formally stated Goals. Oh, certainly, they want things and are taking action to do them, up to and including trying to kill the trollbabe on occasion, but tose are not Goals in game-mechanics terms, and they're not directly resolved by dice in the same way trollbabes' Goals are. (pg. 36)<br/> </p></div></blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/paganini" title="paganini"><img alt="paganini" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/paganini">paganini</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464825/#Comment_464825" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-15T22:16:31+00:00" title="July 15, 2017 10:16PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ANALYSIS AND SOME BEEVES<br/><br/>Trollbabe has a lot of actual play examples interleaved with the rules to reveal how one applies the rules in practice. I purposely excluded examples from the above rules quotes because I wanted to try to present the actual rules as coherently as possible. A lot of the incoherence and contradiction arises between what the rules say and how the examples tell you to apply them. <br/><br/>After all that text about how the mechanics resolve conflicts of interest between characters, and how trollbabes can \u201cjust do stuff\u201d or \u201cif the trollbabe can\u2019t do it, no one else even has a prayer,\u201d the actual play examples are, over and over again, scenes in which a lone trollbabe climbs towers, breaks gates, and swims oceans. <br/><br/>Example 1: Immediately after reiterating over and over again that Conflicts are not about difficult tasks but rather are about disputes between characters, there\u2019s an extended example about\u2026 climbing a tower. \n<blockquote class="Quote"><br/>All adventures concern the Stakes, ultimately. When a trollbabe does something which [sic] physically she can do, but which [sic] throws stress upon some other character\u2019s relationship to the Stakes, then you as GM should call a conflict about it.<br/><br/>[Note: \u201cThe Stakes\u201d is a prep tool that the GM uses to create the scenario and motivate the NPCs. The players do not know what the Stakes are, and are advised to forget that the Stakes even exist.] <br/><br/><i>You\u2019re playing your trollbabe, who has come to a dark watchtower overlooking a valley and mountain pass. You say, \u201cI\u2019d like to climb up in there myself.\u201d That\u2019s no problem, and there\u2019s no obvious conflict because no one is standing there saying she can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t. However, this tower is important to the local chieftain, who has instigated great fear among his people regarding vague \u201cenemies\u201d coming from this direction. I\u2019ve established this as part of the adventure prep, and it\u2019s a key part of the Stakes because they happen to be about whether a certain village girl ends up married to this chieftain or not. Therefore, as GM, I need to call a conflict between the trollbabe and, effectively, the chieftain, even though she\u2019s never met him, and even though the conflict\u2019s details will be played out between her, the physicality of the tower, and the men watching from it.</i><br/></blockquote>\nThis is sheer nonsense. Conflicts are not about the Stakes, ever, period. The Stakes exist \u201cIn the GM\u2019s Mind Only.\u201d Conflicts are defined, over and over again, as being disputes between characters present in the scene. <br/><br/>Setting aside the obvious fictional problems (what do \u201cvague \u2018enemies\u2019\u201d have to do with whether or not the chieftain marries a certain village girl? How can the trollbabe\u2019s climbing this tower be stressing either of those elements one way or another?) what exactly is the GM supposed to say to the player at this moment? The Stakes are a secret from the player. The trollbabe and the chieftain aren\u2019t aware of each others\u2019 existence, and the chieftain is not present in the scene. There\u2019s no \u201cincompatible interest\u201d between them, no \u201ccrisis point,\u201d in fact no \u201cperceived interest\u201d on the part of either of them, no uncompromising disagreement, and no rising tension driving the trollbabe to risk harm. <br/><br/>Furthermore, what Action Type is the GM supposed to use to resolve this nonexistent \u201cmajor disagreement\u201d that hasn\u2019t arisen between two characters who are unaware of each others\u2019 existence? <br/><br/>It\u2019s not Social; she\u2019s not talking her way up the \u201cphysicality of the tower\u201d or getting the tower to \u201cchange its behavior.\u201d<br/>It\u2019s not Magic; she\u2019s not doing any kind of extended ritual to levitate or teleport or whatever.<br/>It\u2019s not Fighting; there are no other characters there saying she can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t (I.e., there are no NPCs for her to hurt, kill, or violently subdue).<br/><br/>Maybe we can shoehorn it into Fighting by saying that once she gets to the top of the tower the \u201cmen watching from it\u201d attack her, or something, but that seems extra lame. <br/><br/>Furthermore *again,* what is the player supposed to say when the GM tells him to state the trollbabe\u2019s Goal? The trollbabe is supposed to *do something* to *someone else* in order to *get what she wants.* The point of Conflicts is that they are immediate. They are events (this is even a rule!) that happen right here, right now, in this scene. The trollbabe takes action, and the players determine right here, right now, what happens because of it. <br/><br/>This trollbabe is just climbing a tower - a thing that, according to the rules, either she can *just do,* or *she can\u2019t, and if she can\u2019t do it neither can anyone else.* <br/><br/>So, maybe this is just a terribly unhappy example. An example, in fact, of what not to do. It is confusing that it is presented as an example of \u201chere\u2019s how to do what we just talked about,\u201d when, in fact, it is point for point exactly the opposite of the rules. But if I just ignore it and say \u201chey, this Climbing the Tower Conflict is against the rules, I won\u2019t have any of those in my game\u201d it might be OK. <br/><br/>Example 2: I\u2019m not going to type all this out, but, basically, the next section is about how - if you feel so-inspired in the moment - you can treat features of the environment as \u201ccharacters\u201d for dramatic effect. The example is (again) a lone trollbabe. This time she\u2019s on an abandoned sinking ship, and she has a Conflict with the ocean to swim to shore. This actually isn\u2019t so bad, except that the metaphor strains the transitive nature of the trollbabe\u2019s Goal. What exactly is she supposed to have done to the ocean to defeat it that allowed her to swim safely to shore? What does it mean to hurt, kill, or subdue an ocean? Or did she talk it out of trying to drown her? The example actually calls on her to use magic, which is, sadly, against the rules again. She jumps into the ocean from a rapidly sinking ship and calls for a conflict. There\u2019s no opportunity for uninterrupted lengthy rituals. <br/><br/>Example 3: This one is about how if the trollbabe\u2019s action is above her Scale, but her roll still succeeds, she still achieves her Goal, but by doing some lesser, Scale-appropriate version of her action. But if the Goal is above her scale, she can\u2019t achieve that Goal, regardless of how she rolls, and a \u201cgood show\u201d is the best she can do.<br/><br/>Specifically, the lone trollbabe (surprise) wants to get inside a castle, but there\u2019s a locked gate in her way (geez). The point here is fine - a Personal Scale trollbabe can\u2019t kill a whole army singlehandedly, no matter how the player verbalizes the Conflict - but I dunno why the example had to be about a lone trollbabe breaking a gate with a rock. <br/><br/>So, these problems are all to do with bad examples of play. We can charitably assume Ron was having a bad day when he wrote them, pretend they don\u2019t exist, and only have Conflicts between present cross-motivated characters. However, even so, I have a deeper objection that I'm not sure how to fix. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/paganini" title="paganini"><img alt="paganini" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/paganini">paganini</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464826/#Comment_464826" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-15T22:22:12+00:00" title="July 15, 2017 10:22PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PRIME BEEVE<br/><br/>All right, the previous objections were technical - the examples of play contradict the rules. This one is more moral, sort of. If we play by the rules, we get a result that I don\u2019t like.<br/><br/>So, my trollbabe, Arica, is sitting in the tavern enjoying a mug of ale and a tasty shank of mutton. Thanks to previous scenes involving the Stakes and the R-Map and so on, the GM has decided that his NPC, Skafloc, is angry at Arica. <br/><br/>GM: \u201cSkafloc comes in. He walks up to Arica and punches her in the face. Conflict! Fighting!\u201d <br/><br/>Now, because of the rules, I am hamstrung. I can\u2019t just say \u201coh, there\u2019s no Conflict, Arica just gets punched.\u201d The rule is that if someone calls for a Conflict, a Conflict *must occur,* with Goals, Actions, and dice.<br/><br/>Without a Goal, there\u2019s no conflict. A Conflict is required, and so a Goal is also required. The GM, by the rules, can force my trollbabe to want something, which means the GM can force me, the player, to invent a Goal for her, even if I don\u2019t want to. <br/><br/>What I want is for my trollbabe to want to finish her dinner, to ignore Skafloc, and / or de-escalate, or just to take the punch and laugh in his face. But it is *against the rules* for me to want her to want those things. <br/><br/>Clearly, what\u2019s going on here is that Skafloc has an agenda (i.e., "Skafloc wants to humiliate you in front of the townspeople\u201d), but that agenda has no existence in system terms. The Goal for the Conflict is not what Skafloc wants, but what Arica wants. What Arica wants is to finish her dinner in peace, but that is not an eligible Goal. The Goal must be transitive  (she does something *to* someone else), and, because the GM selected the Fighting Action Type for the Conflict, her actions are also limited. Her Goal can't just be any old thing like "I get up and leave" or "I take the punch and laugh in his face" or \u201cI talk some sense into him.\u201d Because the GM made it a Fighting Conflict, Arica is constrained to hurt, maim, or violently subdue Skafloc.<br/><br/>I think this is a problem about active vs. passive characters and how they interact with the Conflict resolution mechanics. If I say my trollbabe wants something and does something and I call for a conflict about that, the rules work fine. They don't work if my trollbabe is not doing anything in particular and the GM says that there's a Conflict because of something that an NPC did. <br/><br/>Another way to say it is that the GM is encouraged to play grabby NPCs who have agendas and take action, but those NPCs have no system agency. The only possible result of an NPC action is that it triggers trollbabe system agency, even if it makes no sense for that to happen. I don\u2019t know how to fix this, and it is exactly the kind of thing that  does happen frequently in actual play.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/paganini" title="paganini"><img alt="paganini" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/paganini">paganini</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464827/#Comment_464827" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-15T22:23:14+00:00" title="July 15, 2017 10:23PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 15, 2017 10:23PM by paganini.">edited July 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            LAST BEEVE<br/><br/>There\u2019s this old thread from the Forge:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php?topic=31349.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php?topic=31349.0</a><br/><br/>It\u2019s referring to a discussion towards the back of the rules about advanced applications.

Were we philosophizing about their causes, my bet would be on a combination of Ron's writing style (he has never convinced me that he writes clearly, only that he believes he does) and the fact that his games wrestle with fundamental concerns of roleplaying, and consequently can get pretty challenging for the reader at times.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/paganini" rel="nofollow">paganini</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>PRIME BEEVE</p></div></blockquote>\nThis is a legit complaint, but I believe that the game is intentionally the way it is - it just doesn't explain itself as well as we may be able to in hindsight. Try this explanation on for size:<br/><br/>So what's going on here is that Ron hates turtling behaviours, and he wants players to have mucho directorial powers as well. So what he does is, he gives the player who takes the initiative in picking a conflict some considerable powers in defining the situation. It's a first-mover advantage, plain as simple, encouraging players to see conflicts early and jump into them with alacrity.<br/><br/>The GM is not playing, so he should not generally be winning the initiative left and right: he frames scenes and knows the backstory, so the "free play" stage of play at the beginning of scenes when we don't know if it's going to a conflict or not is not for his benefit - it's for the trollbabe who's learning about what's going on and deciding on how to react. If the GM were to grab for the conflict as soon as he can, the trollbabe would never get it. His chance of starting conflicts is for the benefit of engaging and drawing in characters, not so he can bully characters arbitrarily.<br/><br/>This is the single part in your example where I'm uncertain about it: is the GM engaging in best practices when he frames and declares conflict all at once, instead of introducing the idea that Skafloc is acting hostile at the restaurant before giving the player the opportunity to declare conflict? If the player gets that chance and passes the ball back to the GM, then I think it's clearly the Trollbabe way to let Skafloc pick Fighting and do whatever he wants, but without that chance for the trollbabe to react, I don't know. Maybe the overall development of the story calls for sudden GM initiative like this?<br/><br/>Either way, the way Trollbabe works in this regard is weird, which is par for the course in an Adept Press game - that's why we love them. In a "normal" advocacy-based narrativist game you would only have a conflict when both sides want it, because that safety valve keeps conflicts legitimate: a conflict needs to be morally supported by its participants, which is not true if the participants cannot choose to fold instead. We see this in a whole bunch of games, it's presumably familiar to everybody here how that works.<br/><br/>In Trollbabe, though, the relationship between the presumed situation and the moral necessity of conflict is reversed: players have a subjective right to call for conflict when they feel it appropriate, the trollbabe player gets to pick the Goal however they want, but the GM also has the responsibility to introduce complications appropriate to the conflict pace and type when they narrate the on-going conflict, <i>whatever the Goal ended up being</i>. I believe that Ron's weirdness about spontaneously appearing enemies and such is about this feature: the conflict-declarer has a subjective right to want a specific type of conflict at almost any time, which leaves the GM with wide leeway to satisfy that want with improvised game content that provides adversity against the Goal. If there's a Fighting conflict here, then by Jove we're going to have a fight even if I have to trump up one from nothing!<br/><br/>The envisioned way of playing the game is very active on the trollbabe's part: they say what they want, and they roll the dice for it as per the conflict resolution system. The system provides the appropriate mechanical resistance, while the GM invents the story matter that goes along with it. Sometimes the enemies fall easily, other times it's more difficult. The unilateral right to declare conflicts goes with this envisioned style of play and provides us with two basic types of situations:<br/><b>Trollbabe-initiated conflicts:</b> The conflict Type and Goal comes from the same player, while the adversity comes from the other guy. In these conflicts the potential weirdness is that some adversity simply needs to be trumped up out of thin air so the conflict can legitimately occur, because the player went and declared conflict without any obvious enemy in sight.<br/><b>GM-initiated conflicts:</b> The conflict Type and adversity (action choreography, should one desire so) come from the same player, while the Goal comes from the other guy. The potential weirdness is that the established adversity could be highly irrelevant for the Goal; again, the solution is to invent new adversity that complicates achieving the Goal.<br/><br/>Applying this to your example, we have three stages of operation:<br/><b>1)</b> The GM should probably give Arica a chance to seize initiative, if she is willing and capable.<br/><b>2)</b> The conflict should only be declared if the GM believes in good faith that the situation conflicts with the trollbabe's goals.<br/><b>3)</b> If the trollbabe's Goal in the situation proves trivial in terms of defined fictional adversity ("My goal is to submit to Skafloc in all ways"), it's up to the GM to nevertheless improvise resistance. The fact that a conflict of a certain type has been declared formally trumps the mere details of what it's going to be about.<br/><br/>Assuming we're good on issues 1 and 2, if we do stumble on 3, my belief is that Trollbabe presupposes that we're always dicing against the Goal, whatever it is, and thus if your character's Goal is to <i>not</i> beat up Skafloc, then perhaps that's precisely what's going to happen if you lose - you snap under his provocation and break his back. Or maybe ninjas attack and disrupt that supper - the fact is that there's a player here who wants a fight, so there's gonna be one.<br/><br/>All of this assumes that the players are genuine about conflict initiative, the conflict types and character Goals, so there's no derring-do occurring around intentionally mis-stated Goals or anything like that. The fact that the player needs to be honest about their character's Goals is important in that it is the only safety railing for the scene to actually not fall flat: the GM can invent new complications and adversial challenges all they want, but if the Goal is "I want to pick flint from my belly button fully ironically", then it's just not going to be that amazing. Presumably the only way to get that far into dysfunction is if the GM completely misjudged the situation while declaring conflict <i>and</i> the trollbabe player is picking malicious Goals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464834/#Comment_464834" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-16T01:35:36+00:00" title="July 16, 2017  1:35AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My treatment on the "you can't fold out of conflicts" issue touches upon the other issue you mentioned, which I might say something about as well. Namely, we're talking about the definitions of the conflict Type domains: does Fighting always mean that somebody is going to be hurt?<br/><br/>My take on this is that Ron's definitions about the core meaning of the different conflict Types are instructive only, and not authoritative. Rather, the fact is that all conflicts that are dramatically conflicts are legitimate events in the game, and the fictional content of the conflict strictly trumps the suggested nature of the conflict as described by its Type.<br/><br/>My basic reason for making this claim is that there are many conflict situations that make sense in artistic terms (as literary conceits) that do not fit into the conflict resolution system if one reads the Typing restrictively. All sorts of non-violent physical contests are one example, and cerebral "non-magical" (whatever that means) contests are another. One could say that the game is intentionally saying that some situations are impossible for trollbabes to solve (they only know fighting and magic, so you're shit out of luck if your problem involves e.g. swimming), but as Ron's examples consistently point the other way, and it's largely more fun that way, I'd rather pick that.<br/><br/>My interpretation is that the Type descriptions mix up two types of textual content regarding the topic: there are formal modal ideas about how to differentiate between the Types in broad and abstract terms, and then there are also more detailed ideas about the specific thematic implications of resolving situations using one Type or another. The former are rules, the latter are suggestions that generally hold true, but may be overridden by specific fictional situations.<br/><br/>By my reading, here are the simple rules for picking a conflict Type:<br/><b>Fighting:</b> If it's an immediate physical contest, it's Fighting. The more serious, the more brutal, but this also includes stuff like climbing, swimming, jogging competitively.<br/><b>Magic:</b> If it's a non-immediate problem, it can be resolved with magic. For non-magical problems (say somebody needs their taxes done) one <i>could</i> say that trollbabes can't do that at all, but because they always can use magic to do it anyway, the difference is pretty moot - might as well treat the Type as "anything and everything cerebral and non-immediate", and who knows maybe doing math is human-magic.<br/><b>Social:</b> If it's a social approach to resolving the issue, it's Social. Never seen a problem with this one, I think.<br/>Note that whoever declares the conflict decides between the Types, <i>but only when the situation allows for several approaches.</i> Often it does allow a choice, but the established situation trumps arbitrary freedom, so the more carefully a situation is described, the less honest leeway there is.<br/><br/>The "color ideas" that Fighting is violent and Magic is magical are instructive and should be followed in general, unless trumped by specific situations. I think that "picking Fight means that somebody is going to be hurt" holds true in that "talking everybody down" is not a legit Fighting Goal (it imposes on the Social domain), but it's not true in that it would be somehow impossible for a trollbabe to climb up a cliffside without "hurting" the cliff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/paganini" title="paganini"><img alt="paganini" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/paganini">paganini</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464836/#Comment_464836" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-16T04:10:03+00:00" title="July 16, 2017  4:10AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Eero!\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Ron's writing style (he has never convinced me that he writes clearly, only that he believes he does) </p></div></blockquote>\nLOL!

It is, in a way, a sort of "develop in play" approach. You have three mechanical spheres (numerical ranges) that just happen to be named "Fight," "Social," and "Magic." The group determines through continued play just what things each sphere is actually for. This reminds me of John Harper's "Stranger Things" adaptation of Trollbabe, where the names were very colorful but abstract (I think they were like "Blood," "Shadow," and that sort of thing). <br/><br/>It's difficult for me to think that this is actually the intent expressed by the text of Trollbabe, though. <br/><br/>- N                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/paganini" title="paganini"><img alt="paganini" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/paganini">paganini</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464837/#Comment_464837" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-16T04:55:05+00:00" title="July 16, 2017  4:55AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2017 7:01AM by paganini.">edited July 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A followup thought:<br/><br/>"Social" is easy because for anything to be "Social" there must be other people present. There's not really any way to expand "Social" into something else. <br/><br/>But if we expand "Fighting" from "hurting people" through "physical conflict" into "physical action" we eventually arrive at a place where the trollbabe is by herself climbing towers and conflicts don't make much sense. <br/><br/>I kind of like the notion of "Magic" as the default "manipulate the world" ability. Magic, in the text, has the fewest examples and directions, and its list of Goals are often kind of mundane things (like "travel") that are tricky to think of as conflicts. Even today, knowing full well that we only roll the dice for conflicts, I read that list and I can't help thinking of task resolution. <br/><br/>If I say "Arica uses magic to fly to Foggy Bottom," then there's no roll for that. She just flies to Foggy Bottom.

Makes me think that the whole thing about conflict being between characters is just a guideline that attempts to keep drama-blind people from misusing the conflict mechanics for task resolution purposes.<br/><br/>(If one were truly serious about the dictum that conflicts are directly between people and nothing else, then all the examples to the contrary wouldn't be legit conflicts. However, clearly at least some of them are for some types of stories.)<br/><br/>Speaking of dramatic theory in general, the Trollbabe definition of conflict seems to tell us that even if there might be storytelling potential in "Man vs. the World" or "Man vs. Himself", for this specific game these types of conflicts should be stylistically ignored or glossed over. One gets the sense that Trollbabe conflicts should be somewhat intimate and fundamentally social in that there is a living will and intent behind the problems the trollbabes struggle with. Perhaps this is all that the conflict constraint ultimately attempts to be, a statement of overall theme for the game; something to follow, and ignore as creative direction requires.<br/><br/>(What is the generalized drama theory definition of conflict? It is the notion that the struggle of a protagonist expresses a thematic idea to the audience. I do not know if Trollbabe defines conflict more narrowly for stylistic reasons or pedagogical reasons; considering the age of the game it could simply be that it's trying out an alternate way to capture the concept. The "is there an opponent involved" criterion does have the advantage in being pedagogically simpler than a full-blown "if it's a conflict in the literary sense, then roll the dice" definition would be.)<br/><br/>The idea of indirect conflict does not confuse me as such: the trollbabe who is climbing a tower built by the malicious intent of NPC X, or flying to Foggy Bottom to seek the hiding NPC Y, is still in conflict with the intentions of a NPC - whether that NPC happens to be actively present in the scene doesn't seem that pertinent, as long as it is by their will that the trollbabe is having a hard time. This is largely how Magical conflicts go, anyway: these are the reasons why you can't just waltz in an get what you want, and this is the magic that you use to circumvent the situation. Only rarely are magicians leisurely set up at their respective corners of a boxing ring, toiling to see who gets their potion to the boil first.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/paganini" rel="nofollow">paganini</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Before I totally relinquish the complaint, though, I want to offer the observation that, both in the text and in forum posts, Ron routinely encouraged Trollbabe GMs to pressure the players by sending really pushy NPCs after them to hit their low numbers.

My own instinct is more to set up out-of-scope obstacles to encourage variety in problem-solving: if your enemy's will is being backed by an army in a given situation, then you're not going to Fight your way into dominating them, and therefore other kinds of solutions are indicated.<br/><br/>Ultimately I think that the game's a little bit trapped by the mechanical master constraint that both sides have an unilateral right to declare conflict and its Type at all times. It is a conceit that, when taken literally, shares power in a little bit of a mutually assured destruction fashion. Makes for an interestingly sparky gaming experience with the right sort of players who are willing to push a bit, but have the sensibility to not trample over the fictional conceits entirely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/paganini" title="paganini"><img alt="paganini" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/paganini">paganini</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464862/#Comment_464862" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-16T22:25:38+00:00" title="July 16, 2017 10:25PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here is a point of strong agreement I share with Ron:<br/><br/>Traditional literary theory categories of conflict are useless. <br/><br/>To be useful, a theory needs to do one or both of two things:<br/><br/>1. Help me understand someone else's work and why it succeeds or fails; an analysis tool.<br/>2. Guide my own private crafting process; a creative tool. <br/><br/>Sorting stories into little boxes named "Man vs. Man" and "Man vs. Nature" neither helps me make my stories interesting, nor understand why someone else's story succeeds or fails. Trollbabe (and Sorcerer!) do enrich my creativity in specific technical and procedural ways. That is why, even mired in Ron's jibber-jabber as they are, I keep going back to them. I haven't found anything else like them. <br/><br/>I think Trollbabe (and Sorcerer as its ancestor) is an expression of a theoretical idea incorporated straight out of Egri; that the word "Conflict" is useful only as the name of one specific literary structure. Namely: <br/><br/>We have a character who is<br/><br/>1. Motivated (he wants something)<br/>2. Committed (he won't or can't turn away from wanting or trying to get whatever it is)<br/>3. Blocked (some other motivated and committed agent is opposing him) <br/><br/>If we hit on all three (which is really four things; two characters, each both motivated and committed) we can't escape without making some choice and taking some morally-weighted action. Theme emerges. Story Now. <br/><br/>To paraphrase one of my very favorite Bertrand Russel quotes, if good-faith interaction fails to reach an accord, violence or manipulation are the only tools we have available to proceed. Russel was speaking of the action of states (diplomacy, force, and propaganda) but it applies just as well to individual people. I think the truly brilliant part of Trollbabe is that it perfectly encapsulates this notion mechanically. We take committed motivated characters, set them on a collision course, and our mechanical options for dealing with them are to hurt them or manipulate them. <br/><br/>IMO, this brilliance is terribly blunted by the wishy-washy tower-climbing ocean-swimming gate-crashing examples. <br/><br/>So my theory, slightly counter to yours, Eero, is that, originally, Trollbabe was here to teach us the message that <a href="http://lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/674" rel="nofollow">Vincent's Ski Lift</a> is not really a conflict. <br/><br/>In older Forge posts Ron used to refer to the Trollbabe text in kind of the same way as a Bible literalist refers to the new testament. Very specifically, and very strict. He would say things like "Trollbabe is the only game I know of where at every point in play a rule is in effect." <br/><br/>I think that what happened is, over time, Ron being a kind of arty guy who likes "black-belt play," he found more and more clever and abstract ways to use the mechanics that did not fall within the strict original parameters.<br/><br/>I get what you're saying about "spooky action at a distance" conflicts. As long as the players know that this or that thing is against the interests of the characters, we can expand the mechanics to cover more things than just the characters' immediate motivational disputes, even if the characters themselves don't know that their interests are being threatened. <br/><br/>A slight tangent:<br/><br/>The above discussion of conflict applies equally well to Sorcerer, notwithstanding Ye Olde Timey List O' Difficulties in the back. Even in the original text of Sorcerer, which is weighed down by Ron struggling with a huge mass of "gamer baggage," there's still a paragraph about how Sorcerer resolves only what other games call "opposed actions." The annotations significantly expand on this concept. I think that, at their core, Sorcerer and Trollbabe are substantively the same game. <br/><br/>- N                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/paganini" title="paganini"><img alt="paganini" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/paganini">paganini</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464863/#Comment_464863" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-17T00:27:58+00:00" title="July 17, 2017 12:27AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought it might be instructive to get out the old original version of Trollbabe and compare it with the new one, so I dug out my PDF this morning. Interestingly, it suffers from exactly the same problem I talked about in my first post, in a slightly reorganized way. <br/><br/>The instructions for declaring conflicts are even more strongly stated than I remembered, consistently using the word "must." \n<blockquote><br/>The person declaring the conflict must specify who is in conflict, about what, and what Action Type is involved \u2013 basically providing everybody with a \u201csquaring off" context in which to get involved, knowing who is up against whom, and about what.<br/>. . .<br/>*  If the declarer of the conflict is a player, his or her character must be involved, and the declaration should specify what NPCs are involved as well.<br/>. . .<br/>Characters involved in conflicts must state Goals, which are essentially the desired outcomes for those characters. <br/></blockquote>\nAnd then, the very next example is not the tower-climbing, ocean-swimming, or gate-crashing one, but it is Retta's "on the lookout for ambush" perception conflict that has caused so much confusion over the years. \n<blockquote><br/><i><br/>It all depends on clarifying the Goal for a stated conflict. When the player says, \u201cRetta\u2019s watching out for skulking thugs,\u201d the GM must say, \u201cOK, we have a conflict. What\u2019s your goal?\u201d If the player says, \u201cTo make sure nothing\u2019s there,\u201d then success will mean no one\u2019s there, but if the player says, \u201cTo see if anyone\u2019s trying to bushwhack me,\u201d then success means that they are indeed doing so, but the trollbabe spotted them in time. Or if the player says,\u201cTo avoid anyone who\u2019s trying to bushwhack me,\u201d then success means they\u2019re there, but she gives them the slip.<br/></i><br/></blockquote>\nRereading this now, in the context of our previous discussion, I can articulate more clearly why this has always bugged me. This gets back to what you were saying earlier, Eero, about "providing adversity."<br/><br/>The problem with the example is that "make sure" is used equivocally. When Retta says "make sure," she means "I want to check and see (i.e., verify) that nothing is there." She can't mean (as the example takes her to mean) "I want to cause there to be nothing there." <br/><br/>There's no action that Retta can take to "make sure nothing's there." She can't *cause* there to be no bandits through her own agency - that's against the "the world belongs to the GM" rule. (How would that even work? How could Retta have a conflict with the entire game-world? What action could she use against it to retroactively unhappen hypothetical bandits?) She also can't call for a conflict and then say that bandits have been following her - that's against the "no new information" rule. In other words, it's up to the GM to provide the adversity (bandits) if he wants to; not to decide whether they're there or not using a die roll. <br/><br/>If the example had followed the proper order ("With who?" comes before "What's your goal?") this would have been clear:<br/><br/>EITHER<br/><br/>Player: Retta's watching out for skulking thugs.<br/>GM: Nothing is there. (Because the GM has prepped no bandits, or thinks bandits would be boring at this stage and doesn't improvise any, no mechanical Conflict is required.)<br/><br/>OR<br/><br/>Player: Retta's watching out for skulking things.<br/>GM: Conflict!<br/>Player: With who? <br/>GM: There are some bandits sneaking up on you. What's your Goal?<br/>Player: To make sure they don't bushwhack me!<br/><br/>- N                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464866/#Comment_464866" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-17T02:45:24+00:00" title="July 17, 2017  2:45AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2017 2:45AM by AsIf.">edited July 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see that.
