(It's only oneway, and there's a limit to it's use.)<br/><br/>Ideally, I'd like to see the hearthstone used in this fashion: a group (or a single player) can pop out of a dungeon to head back to town whenever a night's session has naturally ended, rather then picking up from inside the dungeon. As a result, you can reasonable have different characters (and different players) switch in/out of the group for a given night's attempt.<br/><br/>On the other hand: does this create overly wonky/weird fictional outcomes? How do you justify this without breaking the rest of the game? (And indeed: being able to get back to town basically at-will would unbalance other aspects of D&amp;D.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136102/#Comment_136102" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-24T08:11:14+00:00" title="March 24, 2008  8:11AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Find some in-fiction reasons to mirror the "only used at the end of the session" thing you want to get out of it.

I think it's important to have some kind of token on the other side. Here are two options.<br/><br/>One I used in a D&amp;D campaign was a powerful benefactor who sent them on crazy adventures. (He didn't have time for the little stuff.) He gave the party magical rings that could bring them back to his tower. <br/><br/>Another option is to give each player <i>two</i> hearthstones, and one can always be used to teleport to the other one. Each adventurer has to find a safe place to store his "home" hearthstone so it doesn't get stolen -- but there are some adventure opportunities, no? Also, if someone finds their "home" hearthstone and figures out how to use it, they could teleport to the adventurer. This could be used to track down and attack the party at an inopportune moment, or it could drop a fairly helpless (but curious) NPC into the party's lap and now they have to protect them from danger.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136111/#Comment_136111" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-24T09:03:29+00:00" title="March 24, 2008  9:03AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 24, 2008 9:37AM by lachek.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the two linked hearthstones idea, it sounds like a really fun toy for the adventurers to play with, aside from the story advantage for players and DM alike.<br/><br/>One thing to watch for, though - introducing any such powerful device could short-circuit adventure situations with ease.

A blast of heat and fire washes over him and he sees the wizard crumple to the floor. Shouts and screams echo around him as the remaining party members go back-to-back, hoards of goblins threatening to overhwelm them. With cold fingers the warrior fumbles in his pouch, lifting the stone from its hiding place, trying not to drop it, slick with his own blood. The runes fill with his life essence and begin to glow as the room starts to waver. <br/><br/>"Home," he thinks. "I just want to go home..." Darkness seeps in from edges as voices fall away, screams of anger and howls of goblin rage fading as though being pulled away, faster and faster ,,, <br/><br/>"Here! Over here!" the voices call. Rough hands flip him over and worried eyes hover above him. "I've found another one! He's in bad shape!

(Especially since the other stone can be stolen and the longer the timespan between losing it from sight and using it, the farther can a wounded adventurer end up after teleporting - which leads me to images of a freezing, wounded warrior dropping nearby a desert caravan.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136232/#Comment_136232" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-25T01:45:44+00:00" title="March 25, 2008  1:45AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a kind of similar element in my work in progress game Yeld.

See the Campaign Guide for more info on Inns, Home, Travel and the Map.</i><br/><br/>And then, from the Campaign Guide:<br/><br/><i>Inns can be found all across Yeld. Sometimes these are actual Inns, serving food and renting beds to travelers. Other times these are just a safe place for us to sleep, like the barn of a friendly farmer or the campsite of a fellow traveler. Paying Coins to stay at an Inn will allow us to gain back lost Core dice (as described in the Fight Guide), but we can also set an Inn as our Home.<br/><br/>A Home is the spot we return to if all of us become Ghosts. This won\u2019t happen often (especially if we have a White Mage), but it\u2019s better to be safe then sorry! If we pay Coins to stay at an Inn we can select it as our Home. We should be sure to choose an Inn that\u2019s on a map square that\u2019s close to where we want to be. The last thing we want is to lose a fight on the East side of Yeld and reappear in our Home Inn on the West side of Yeld!

I can dig it. Also: Portal: the RPG &lt;= Really Needs to Happen. (Ideally in a vanilla system that just emulates physics in a cruel fashion.)<br/><br/>Back on topic: the fictional twists are neat, but I think I'm mainly still interested in supports this social question: how to justify a flexible troupe of adventurers in a dungeonesqe situation. I think it works decently to allow the hearthstone use - warp everyone back to the Inn - but the understanding that the dungeon will react to what you've done. So you can speed through the dungeon on the second go, back the way you came, except you realize the DM has the right to inject new traps / an ambush / other nasties along the way. ("Who replaced the kobolds with a manticore nest?") Not at every step, just at a nasty point or two.<br/><br/>To drift a bit, I'm thinking of some other mechanics/setting elements that might do this.<br/><br/>For another mechanic to borrow from CRPGs: the Bucket! In "Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles", someone has to carry around a Bucket with, dunno, superwater that pushes back the Miasma, this field of ick that saps your health (so, you stay close to the bucket). Here's an alternate version: the dungeons, being inherently Chaotic And Evil, will sap your strength unless you have your protective amulets with you, but they degrade over time. Therefore, your dungeon runs are of a limited time (in fact, as much time as you have in the session) before you have to get out.<br/><br/>The other thought is modifying the dungeon design: shallower actual dungeon coves to dive into, but the insides of a dungeon are more like an underground wilderness. A troup of characters (a superset of all the players) might make camp at one branch of the dungeon, near freshwater, etc., but only a subset (that evening's adventurers) will go into a short actual-dungeon offshoot from the path. Designing for much shorter, less-than-one-session dungeons, but the resource challenge (making it through the larger dungeon in the long haul) is still there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
