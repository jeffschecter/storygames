This is done via a process of hypothesis and experimentation by interacting with the antagonist.<br/><br/>If we see this on the party level, an old school game where you get to understand the ecology and the secrets of a monster before you are able to bring it down, follows a similar structure.<br/><br/>How do you think this can be modelled? In a way it reminds me of a code-cracking puzzle game (mastermind anyone?) where you must take risks and make sacrifices to gain any piece of information by running small -potentially deadly- experiments.<br/><br/>A monster could start out all powerful and be described with a network of advantages and disadvantages and clues that have to be uncovered by expending resources. (Oh no the monster can fly! /advantage/ .. hey but it can only move vertically.. we can use this to trap it /disadvantage/ )<br/><br/>Is there any system that does this well already?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382569/#Comment_382569" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-17T06:54:29+00:00" title="June 17, 2012  6:54AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I recall correctly, <a href="http://kck.st/JjK5Gc" rel="nofollow">Farewell to Fear</a> uses a similar model for conflict resolution.

First one being investigation, as in finding the antagonist strong and weak sides. Second being preparation, where you gather needed resources and finally the execution. Note, you may have those stages repeat, when the "party" can't find the resources needed and needs to find another way, or has failed their attempt in defeating the antagonist. I do not know of a system, that does all 3 in an interesting way.

For example, creatures in Esoterorists have a Special Means of Dispatch - the creature's specific weakness. But in additition to that, you can spend investigative points tactically (tactical fact finding benefits) so you could use architecture to spot a weakness in the ceiling, biology or natural history to find a weak spot, etc. In Night's Black Agents, this is what thriller chaes are all about - using electronic surveillance or cop talk to throw of the cops or urban survival to get a short cut. I've also used this idea in GUMSHOE Fantasy - and you can push quite far in a player-facing direction. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382618/#Comment_382618" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-17T20:52:09+00:00" title="June 17, 2012  8:52PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Where is this GUMSHOE fantasy people keep talking about?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/swavomeer" title="swavomeer"><img alt="swavomeer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/642/n9D042GBVCM5M.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/swavomeer">swavomeer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382644/#Comment_382644" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-18T01:36:55+00:00" title="June 18, 2012  1:36AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2012 1:49AM by swavomeer.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting, will need to check those out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382651/#Comment_382651" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-18T03:52:38+00:00" title="June 18, 2012  3:52AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To be clear, the GUMSHOE approach isn't the OP's in its pure form.

He did essentially what you're describing above, with the dungeon being mapped as one "conflict" and each "trap/room/puzzle" was just a round, where the party had to "see and raise" to stay in.  Worked out a lot like a battle conversation, expecially because in DitV you grab items from your inventory (like information, or Relationships, or Traits, or sometimes physical objects like lock-picks, etc) to add dice to your pool before you respond.<br/><br/>But where it might be weak is that certain items don't merit higher values or higher dice or more potency against certain threats.  Holy water, for instance, would have no more effect (in Dogs in the Vineyard) against a Vampire than against a stubborn child, without some careful handling of the rules and themes.  You could codify some side-rules to represent advantages to know a weakness, or to exploit a network, to grant them more power or more serious Fallout (wounds in DitV, essentially).  Otherwise, it's essentially possible to overcome most threats without doing that legwork, and it takes the wind out of your idea.<br/><br/>Still, the back and forth is something you might want to emulate, if I understand you correctly.  But I've heard a lot of good stuff about Gumshoe too.

We have 4 questionable heroes, and a load of evil goblin-like creatures attacking a small town. In the battle you roll a dice, narrates the result, and possibly you are wounded in the process. Each of the pre-written characters have 4 flashback scenes, all focusing on a shaded and painful past, and each of these scene have a mechanical healing effect if you play them out/narrates them (the player decides). You can activate the scenes as a "response", so you can't be killed before all the scenes have been used, unless you choose not to activate a scene and die instead. So in order for the character to be killed, you have to know his past and his dark secrets. However, the mechanics are pretty much the same as usual.<br/><br/>I bet you can use this method to tell the battle-story you are looking for. Each time you "kill" the monster, it can recharge its hit points, by giving you information on how to really kill it.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
