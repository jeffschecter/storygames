For the projects I've run, the tracking tools show about half of the funds coming from "Kickstarter referrers." The way Kickstarter counts these inflates the number somewhat, but I think at least a third of my funds wouldn't be there without the community Kickstarter has built.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420378/#Comment_420378" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-19T18:14:09+00:00" title="August 19, 2013  6:14PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After IndieGoGo spammed me and tried to make money off of the May Oklahoma Tornado disaster, they can go suck a bag of dicks.

That said, having an Indiegogo as a secondary (and to take payments that Kickstarter can't/won't handle) isn't a bad thing, I just wouldn't lean on it.<br/><br/>Marketing efforts and word-of-mouth are super important.  There are browsers (like myself) but you can't just set it up and wait for them to come, unless you're a zombie board game and/or made a popular video game twenty years ago.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420409/#Comment_420409" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-20T08:15:54+00:00" title="August 20, 2013  8:15AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An important note : kickStarter is definitely the best choice for game, innovative, tech and "large scale" projects.

I've seen it used too many times for situations where:<br/>* The creator tried to raise money on KS, failed. Rather than regroup, rethink, pause, etc, the creator immediately starts an IndieGoGo campaign. The goal is not met, the creator keeps the money (several thousand dollars or more), and in most cases the project never materializes.<br/>-- One single exception I saw was a project called "The Other Brothers", a video game platformer. They eventually developed it for iOS, but apparently have not sent the rewards to any of their backers, who are starting to write angry comments.<br/>* The creator suffered one or a string of failures on Kickstarter (including things like "Kickstarter doesn't approve the project for some reason"), and moved to IndieGoGo to Just Get At That Money. Project never appears to proceed from there.<br/>* To "just get money", with no creative project. "I want to study for a semester in Europe/Asia/etc; and - ew - I don't want to get a job here or there to fund it, so please give me money! As a reward, I'll take selfies of me having fun." I noticed this trend when I searched for "Japan" on Kickstarter (a bunch of culture, music, game, theater, writing projects) and on IndieGoGo (hundreds of folks around college age simply raising donations for overseas study or vacation; which horrified me given all the time I spent raising the money (and working) to make it happen in my own case).<br/><br/>The above two situations (the project ones, not the skuzzy ones) I've seen happen over and over again so many times that I just can't take IGG seriously, not while "Flexible Funding" exists as an option on their site.<br/><br/>There are very few IndieGoGo projects that I'll back at the Flexible Funding level. I'll take more risks on Fixed Funding (ala "Kickstarter"), or where it's clear that the creator is in a country that Kickstarter wasn't available in.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg" title="semajmaharg"><img alt="semajmaharg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/n0TRVVHW3SOVY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg">semajmaharg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420448/#Comment_420448" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-20T14:56:21+00:00" title="August 20, 2013  2:56PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, when I see an IndieGoGo project, I always look to see if it is fixed or flexible.
