While I got some helpful advice, I also got some suggestions to the effect that although the game and setting I am using allows for many kinds of campaigns, the only really viable one is "kill things and take their stuff" (or in the context of the setting, everyone wants to play Firefly). I couldn't disagree more.<br/><br/>The wandering band of rogues out for violence and loot who owe nothing to no one but themselves is a campaign model that is assumed by many roleplaying settings. While I acknowledge the validity of this model, I also think it's more than possible to go outside the lines and turn it on its head (and not just by playing bad guys instead of good guys).<br/><br/>Years ago, I ran a Shadowrun game where all the PCs were cops. Worked great. I've run a great campaign where all the PCs were grunts in a military unit with a functional chain of command (something people seem to avoid because they don't want to/can't deal with all that entails). I'm cooking up the exploration themed campaign I mentioned above, and I don't think there is going to be a single incidence of traditional RPG style combat, although I know there's going to be plenty of tension and conflict. Sometimes a set-up with some restraints, one that isn't just a crew of merry anarchists killing and looting their way across the galaxy (got that out of my system years ago...) can be just as interesting, if not moreso.<br/><br/>I guess I'm just tired of people telling me I can't color outside the lines of the traditional RPG party/campaign model. I've done it a lot, and successfully, over the years. If all of us in the group are down with the concept and willing to make it work, I just don't need the negativity from naysayers who say it can't be done.<br/><br/>OK, got that off my chest...  ;-)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oliof" title="oliof"><img alt="oliof" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.mausdompteur.de/gravn32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oliof">oliof</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58964/#Comment_58964" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-05T01:04:34+00:00" title="March  5, 2007  1:04AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, tell me how to do it.

If I get a better handle on what I want to do (and whether my players want to do it) I'd love to start a thread and talk about it.
