Years before his famous novels inspired an entire generation, Kerouac delved into a world so vivid, so holistic, and so engulfing, that the fact that so little remains of it on paper - most of it disappearing with its creator - is heartbreaking.<br/><br/>Recruiting real baseball players (Lou Gehrig), notables of the day (Pancho Villa), and plenty of fictional players, Kerouac filled up his league, and then set about with the most remarkable game.<br/><br/>Throwing marbles, toothpicks, and homemade dice against a wall 40 feet away, Kerouac would dutifully record the results, and then analyze a collection of 25 handwritten cards to see the result - of each pitch. Everything was accounted for, from foul tips to passed balls to sinking liners in shallow right field.<br/><br/>He diligently produced game after game, and occasionally wrote newsletters for the result (which he gave to his mother) which explained the day's or week's games in an exaggerated Ring Lardner style, the custom writing ideal of the day.<br/><br/>It is said that after Kerouac moved to Mexico City, he would play the game every day, never writing down the results. He would just sit and roll the dice and grunt and peer at his cards and nod or smile, keeping track of an imaginary team playing an imaginary game for the ages.<br/><br/>Tolkien had his Silmarillion; Lewis Carroll his Wonderland; and Kerouac had his Summer League. </blockquote>\nfrom the Cosmic Baseball Association website:\n<blockquote><br/>1935<br/>Kerouac family moves to Sarah Avenue.

My dad, definitely NOT a gaming type of guy, once described to me long ago a baseball game he and his local buddies created. I think it involved dice, but I'm not sure. I think they "played out" games of their favorite teams. <br/><br/>So, my hunch is based on, well, if Dad (a little) and Jack Kerouac (a lot!) did it, I bet there were hundreds or thousands of others who did, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107768/#Comment_107768" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-11T07:26:06+00:00" title="November 11, 2007  7:26AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fantasy baseball is an often overlooked sibling pasttime to roleplaying.<br/><br/>I thought I read an essay by Michael Chabon where he talked about fantasy baseball and D&amp;D as two of his youthful pursuits that brought him to become a writer, but his website at the moment just shows him with goggles on.
