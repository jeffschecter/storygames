In return I have monies, am just generally adorable, and can make people silicone rubber ears or horns if they want.<br/><br/>Also, which games on the LARP and RPG track do people recommend, as there are JUST TOO MANY!!! The only thing I know for certain I want in on is the Night's Black Agents championship.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
