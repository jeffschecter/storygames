We've just finished a 18-month game of Pendragon and we are searching for our new game. RBH was going to be a stand-in one shot. It might be a lot more...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe whipped through the oh-so complicated rules in about five minutes and then ploughed into character creation. This lasted a little longer than I expected -<br/>\nmainly due to the fact that three of the four players rolled two sets of stats, each as bad as the other. Oh how the other player laughed!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end we had the following<br/>\n<br/>\nPharos the Magus<br/>\nAl: +4<br/>\nDa: +2<br/>\nEl: +0<br/>\nSn: +3<br/>\nSz: +1<br/>\nSt: +3<br/>\n<br/>\nTalent: Blast<br/>\nGear: Dagger (Light), Dragonhide Robes (Heavy)<br/>\nSpecial Gear: Imp Familiar<br/>\nMotivation: Make money for more spell research<br/>\n<br/>\nGaroc the Warrior<br/>\nAl: +0<br/>\nDa: +0<br/>\nEl: +0<br/>\nSn: +1<br/>\nSz: +3<br/>\nSt: +2<br/>\n<br/>\nTalent: Armour of Scars<br/>\nGear: Big Sword (Heavy), Plate Armour (Very Heavy)<br/>\nSpecial Gear: Battle Standards with the heads of his fallen foes<br/>\nMotivation: Seeks fame and fortune but mostly fame<br/>\n<br/>\nScrewtail the Fox<br/>\nAl: -1<br/>\nDa: -1<br/>\nEl: +2<br/>\nSn: +2<br/>\nSz: +0<br/>\nSt: +1<br/>\n<br/>\nTalent: Three Tails<br/>\nGear: Bow (Ranged), Fix Sized Samurai Armour (Light)<br/>\nSpecial Gear: Quiver of Arrows he can stab people with<br/>\nMotivation: He has a vixen and 24 cubs to feed...<br/>\n<br/>\nBalan the Bear<br/>\nAl: -1<br/>\nDa: -0<br/>\nEl: +2<br/>\nSn: -1<br/>\nSz: +2<br/>\nSt: +0<br/>\n<br/>\nTalent: Heart Song<br/>\nGear: Mace (Very Heavy), Loincloth and Battle Harness (Light)<br/>\nSpecial Gear: A dope pipe with spreads intoxicating fumes<br/>\nMotivation: To spread the love and bring the party<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd with that I drew a small village in the middle of a piece of paper and offered the players the opening sentence of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n"And thats why you have to retrieve the Cursed Emerald!' said the scarred bear in the smokey tavern.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe each took turns to add a geographical feature to the map until we had done three rotations around the table. Then moving from left to right on the map we<br/>\ncreated the details and linkages between the various areas. So 'Madga the Witch' became 'Magda the One-Eyed Witch who was once the Queen of the Amazon<br/>\nWarriors who guarded the wall between the Kingdom and the Wasteland. However the One Eyed God, who lives in the mountains to the North fell in love with her<br/>\nand cut out her eye to make her in his image. Her scarred ugliness was shunned by the Amazons and she was cast from their martial refuge into exile. She<br/>\nlives alone but secretly she is loved from afar by the insane old hermit, Archimedes the Druid who lives deeper into the Wasteland' etc etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe basic gist of the area was a sort of 'Cursed Earth' wasteland, decimated by a magical accident many years ago. The Kingdom has walled itself off and the<br/>\nsurvivors of the city of Nephos, the epicentre of the accident now find themselves isolated in a small town they created.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe called it F'ked. We thought it was appropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt="2290499899_5e054d6ce2.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2031/2290499899_5e054d6ce2.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130108/#Comment_130108" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T04:18:12+00:00" title="February 25, 2008  4:18AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2008 5:06AM by Neil Gow.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The party questioned the Bear and they discovered that the Emerald was the Dragonheart Emerald and it was blessed to protect the Bear village at the foot of<br/>\nthe Dragons Peak Mountains from being attacked by the deadly spirits that roam the wasteland. Without it the village would surely fall. Additionally the<br/>\nEmerald was cursed and if it was removed from the village it would act as a beacon for the deadly spirits, drawing death and disaster to those around it. The<br/>\nEmerald was taken by spindly spiked black humanoid creatures.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe players decided that they sounded like the sort of constructs that Archimedes the Druid (who is a friend of Balans) would make, so they set off along the<br/>\nRoad of Broken Glass to the Forest of the Lonely Druid. However, that was in the morning - the Bear decided to kick up a massive party, upset the locals and<br/>\nended up in the stocks (failed Eloquence challenge) overnight. He was a sad, wet bear...<br/>\n<br/>\nSome way along the protective road, it had been broken. The Fox, being a talentless but desperately inquisitive sort was flying overhead and was acting as a<br/>\nscout. He failed his conflict to notice the ghoulish dead waiting for them to cross the road and they were beset by a pack of 12 spirits desperate to feed on<br/>\nthem. After a few spluttering starts the despatched them with little trouble and Balan used his Heart Song for the first time (Every time he does that, the<br/>\nplayer gives the wounded player a big happy grin, double thumbs up and a Fonz-like 'heeeeeey' to signify his happy aura of healing. So funny...)<br/>\n<br/>\nArriving late at night they gain entry to Archimedes towering oak tree home, but only after he has shown his disdain for the Fox. The part question the druid<br/>\nabout the assailants but he knows nothing about them - but he could if he knew what they were made of. Meanwhile Screwtail secreted himself into the druids<br/>\nroom and pissed in his bed in revenge for the insult - only to notice a flying black obsidian barge, trailing ropes holding dozens of spikey creatures<br/>\ndrifting towards them over the forest, helmed by a giant version of the spikey things (Obsidian golems for now on!)<br/>\n<br/>\nRaising the alarm, the heroes rushed to meet their foe. Archimedes used his plant magic to deal with the mooks (window dressing only) whilst the players<br/>\ndealt with the giant golem, which was despatched with little effort by an ably assisted Magus!<br/>\n<br/>\nObsidian Golem<br/>\nHP 10 AC 12<br/>\nAl: +2<br/>\nDa: +2<br/>\nEl: -1<br/>\nSn: -1<br/>\nSz: +5<br/>\nSt: +2<br/>\nThick Skin<br/>\nImpressive Heavy Reach Weapon (large stone shards from fists)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe druid soon identified the rock and challenged the Magus to also identify it - which he did as a rock natural to The Mountain of Black Rock in the Dragon<br/>\nPeaks. He also said that it was emanating evil and destroying the natural<br/>\n<br/>\n(Yes, Blackrock Mountain - the game was scattered with WoW references but in a very good way.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe party then headed south towards the mountains, stopping first at the Monastary of the Sun, a polished stone outpost (the monks polishing it with their<br/>\nbare hands - hardcore!) of warrior monks who watch over the ruins of Nephos. The monks leader - the Most Enlightened Eye, Do - met with the players to answer<br/>\ntheir questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow he is a right piece of work as he believes in accuracy in everything. So when they presented them with 'the Evil rock' he questions whether the rock is,<br/>\nin fact, evil or whether it is an innocent bystander caught up in the evil acts caused by the magic that animated it. Queue five minutes of infuriating<br/>\nconversation with the players who were tearing their hair out. Eventually he twigged that the players were going into the Ruins and he said they could not<br/>\npass. Even though they pledged that they were 'just passing through' the motivation of the Magus was visible to his Enlightened Eye and he knew he would<br/>\npilfer the ruins. To prove their point they entered Trial by Combat - Garoc vs Do! Sword vs Naginata! Loincloth wearing monk vs loincloth clad warrior!<br/>\nAs the battle raged, Screwtail attempted an Assist by screaming 'Oh My God, you can see his bollocks through that!' which failed, not bothering the monk but<br/>\nmaking Garoc look instead! He still won however and shamed, the monks let them pass into the Ruins of Nephos.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe tiered city of Nephos was destroyed by the magical disaster and lay in ruins. The players mentioned that they had heard there were vampires in the ruins,<br/>\nwhich made the mages determined efforts to find the Library of Mnemnos all the more silly! But find it they did, underground. As they descended they found a<br/>\nlarge room filled with broken shelves and destroyed books, laid out like a large campsite, with a fire pit in the middle of the room. Around the firepit they<br/>\nfound pots of cold stew - human head stew!!! They then heard the inhabitants of the camp site returning - miners from the Tribe of the Severed Tongue<br/>\n(worshippers of the One-Eyed God who cut out their own tongue so that they will only hear the words of their god!). The heroes ran ... straight into<br/>\nsomething even worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nA barge laden with black obsidian rock from the mountain was floating into a newly opened magical rift, powered by a Severed Tongue Sorceror, and hundreds of<br/>\nminers had come to see it off! The heroes decided that this had to be stopped so the Magus opened up on the Sorceror whilst the Bear and the Warrior tried to<br/>\ngrab ropes and swing onto the ship. Both failed and crashed down next to the Magus. They protected him from the mooks whilst he battled it out with the dark<br/>\nmagician - who lost and fell into the portal. The magic flared and went haywire and the Magus tried to use it to stablise the portal but failed horribly and<br/>\neverything and everyone was sucked through to the other side of the portal!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich lay on the other side of the map, in the lair of the One Eyed God!! The mooks were all killed by the magical trauma of the journey but the players<br/>\nsurvived to face the wrath of one of the Sons of the One Eyed God, a furious and immense hairy cyclops monster - around whos neck the emerald lay!<br/>\n<br/>\nBalan then engaged the fuming monster in the most charming bout of doublespeak and distracting placating language, explaining that they were there to broker a deal rather than fight and that fighting just wasn't really on the cards at all, here have some beers etc. This gave the party the chance to let his Heart Song ability heal their minor wounds. It would have been churlish not to have allowed it as it was inspirational!<br/>\n<br/>\nSon of the One Eyed God<br/>\nHP 10 AC 12<br/>\nAl: -1<br/>\nDa: +2<br/>\nEl: +0<br/>\nSn: -1<br/>\nSz: +5<br/>\nSt: +5<br/>\nVery heavy Obsidian Club<br/>\nThick Skin<br/>\nBloodlust<br/>\nVicious<br/>\nSecond Weapon (Ranged, Thrown Rocks)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was a much closer fight, with Balan the Bear being injured, Pharos being knocked unconscious and it all coming down to whether Screwtail could hit the<br/>\ngiant for 1 point of damage before he unleashed his stack of Awesome Tokens on the players. The Bloodlust+Viscious combo is particularly brutal!<br/>\nHowever, they did defeat him and retrieved the Emerald, saving the village. Everyone had reached level 2 and for a one-shot the players took great efforts in<br/>\ndeciding what role they should take in the team and what talents would aid that.<br/>\n<br/>\nScrewtail is 'primary assist' and added +1 Alertness and took 'Strategist'<br/>\n<br/>\nGaroc would be 'Tank' and added +1 siz (upgrading his weapon) and took 'Long Shadow'<br/>\n<br/>\nBalan would be 'off-Tank' and took 'A Mighty  Grasp', upgrading his mace<br/>\n<br/>\nPharos continued to be a boom-mage but added one to Stubbornness and took 'Illusions'<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a epilogue I showed the scarred bear enter a large cavern with the emerald. He transformed into a Lizardman and bowed before his Dragonkin lord, who was<br/>\npleased that the emerald was now his and civilisation was doomed!!!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130109/#Comment_130109" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T04:18:31+00:00" title="February 25, 2008  4:18AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Drawing things from the game:<br/>\n<br/>\nd12?

It's realy great. I just wish I could zoom on your map doodle to see it in a larger size. It seems realy excellent.<br><br>I was amused to see that some players at your table chose exactly the same powers for their PCs as mine did. The most obvious being the Fox who began also with Three tails, developped as the scout/assist specialist of the group and took Strategist upon hitting level 2.<br><br>About the monsters being seemingly to weak and having too few hit points : I had the same problems in my latter games. Eric is working on that. I think he'll be able to offer some solutions soon. Some ideas might include : limiting weapons damages to 2, bumping the monsters HP...<br><br>I am also curious about the Awesome Tokens. Specificaly : what did you or your players think of spending them after the attack roll ? Is there still tension or interest in the roll ? Did some players take the risk to attack with very few tokens ? Did you have failed attack rolls ?<br><br>How did you feel about the Dangers of the actions system for non-combat conflict ? Did you often include the danger of failing ? How many dangers max did you use in a given conflict ?<br><br>About the xp problem : do you mean that you denied them the xp because they gave the treasure to their patron (the lizard in disguise/bear) ? I never had this problem in my games because the PCs always were their own patrons for the treasures. Until now, I have found this xp rule realy great : on one hand, the PCs are heroes because they kill the monster that threaten a community, on the other hand, they are thieves that are content (= gain xp) when they steal what's valuable in your town. In the games I ran, this ambiguity gave a very sword &amp; sorcery feel like in Conan's Tower of the Elephant or Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser tales.<br><br>Thanks again for all that.<br><br>Best,<br>Antoine                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130133/#Comment_130133" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T06:59:33+00:00" title="February 25, 2008  6:59AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Antoine<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I have been instructed by the group that my epilogue demands more play, I am going to neaten up the map a little and make the notes more readable. When I do I will certainly post it again.<br/>\n<br/>\nAwesome tokens were fine. In many cases the combats came down to them working out how much damage they could do to the monster before it got another smack at them. The final battle was perfect in that they worked out that they could down it before it struck if everyone hit. Of course, someone missed and it was all on the Fox to do one more point. The monster at that time had managed to accrue 6 Awesome Tokens and with a 3 damage weapon anyway, he was taking someone down like James Brown!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we had many many many failed attack rolls. The magus was the primary offensive weapon of the group and as such the others were attempting to assist on a number of occassions and failing miserably as well. As the session progressed the dice began to play the game but at the start it was painful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI only did a single danger with each conflict - Lose and end up in the stocks, Lose and everyone is Surprised, Lose and you are caught sneaking around, Lose and you are revealed as a liar. There were a couple of times when the players tried to dampen down the impact of the loss, but I explained that it had to be a palpable loss rather than just a situational inconvenience. It worked fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the patron model - well, for example, many a Greek hero does their task and gets their treasure for someone else but the glory is in the task rather than the statue on the fireplace. I slid the rule a little so that they got the xp for retrieving the famous item rather than keeping it for themselves and setting it on a pedastal in their clubhouse.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/andreww" title="andreww"><img alt="andreww" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/andreww">andreww</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130138/#Comment_130138" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T07:29:33+00:00" title="February 25, 2008  7:29AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the factors which was strongly in play in the game is that our magus rolled amazingly for his stats while the rest of us rolled terribly.  <br>\n<br>\nIt fairly quickly became apparent that our attempts at using the Showing Off/Assist action were not going to be all that successful and we kept giving the bad guys awesome tokens.  That probably changes now with the Fox picking up Strategist, although the general feeling was that +5 was too big a bonus.  <br>\n<br>\nSpending awesome tokens after the roll seemed perfectly fine.  Given we had a small number of them flying around they werent used on most rolls.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20O%27Rourke" title="Ian O'Rourke"><img alt="Ian O'Rourke" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20O%27Rourke">Ian O'Rourke</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130198/#Comment_130198" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T09:32:37+00:00" title="February 25, 2008  9:32AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the key is how the characters interact as they earn abilities. Obviously this is less a factor at level 1. It may also put more weight into the stats. I can already see us worrying about the stats more at level 2 as the Fox can be all wily like and generate awesome. I can actually tank now with long shadow, etc.<br><br>A bigger map can be found in the link at:<br><a href="http://www.fandomlife.net/fln/blog.cfm?ID=921" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fandomlife.net/fln/blog.cfm?ID=921</a><br><a href="http://www.fandomlife.net/fln/images/content/rbhmap.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fandomlife.net/fln/images/content/rbhmap.pdf</a><br><br>It's a bit clearer.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130319/#Comment_130319" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T15:38:37+00:00" title="February 25, 2008  3:38PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2008 3:40PM by Eric Provost.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Hey guys, I'm really excited to hear how much you liked the game.  And I really appreciate all your feedback.  The more I get the better I can tune this thing.</p>\n<p>I think this is the first time I've seen the attribute rolls come out so skewed, even after rerolls!  But that's cool.  See, with you guys playing out characters under those conditions, that gives me a couple data points that I may not have gotten otherwise.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>d12? We couldn't scramble five d12s between us. Couldn't all of the dice just be d10s?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>You're not the first one to ask that.  But I'm sticking with my d12s.  I like them.  I like the probabilities they make.  They feel good in my hand.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Alertness, Daring and Size seemed to be far more important as stats than Eloquence, Sneakiness and Stubborness.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>I'm guessing that's because the characters spent more time killing things than talking or sneaking.  That's cool.</p>\n<p>edited to add:  I bet if you used the Danger system a little more, you'd find those other three attributes more and more useful.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>The monsters seemed exceptionally weak when faced with four heroes - even first level ones. 10 HP simply isn't enough</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Balancing the combats still involves lots of guesswork.  I'm working on tuning the game up a bit here, but for now I suggest trying to balance things out by seasoning to taste with more or less mooks.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>I felt that denying players XP for retrieving treasure was a little harsh as it carves out a classic adventure archetype - the patron.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>It is harsh.  The game rewards you for making your character a murderer and a thief.  I had this very same feeling during our last session when the PCs returned a valuable statue to the town it was stolen from.  I'm currently in the middle of deciding if I want to keep the rule or not.  I'll let you know as soon as I make up my mind.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Feedback on the game has been exceptionally positive. We had a right good laugh playing it and it seemed to scratch a loosey-goosey fantasy itch that a number of us had found festering.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Right on.  I'm really glad to hear it.  Thanks again for the feedback.  The game keeps getting better and better with everyone's help.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130405/#Comment_130405" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T23:31:55+00:00" title="February 25, 2008 11:31PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That was fun to read.
