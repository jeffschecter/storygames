Some fancy BSing by Declan and they talk down the grieving aunt who walks in and catches them there. Thanks, cupcakes Sienna thought to bring along!<br/><br/>A dare from Jacqueline got spotty Allison to sing in class and she turned out to be Susan Boyle-amazing, which knocked Zed for a loop. Ophelia stirred up shit by egging Zed on and pushing Jacqueline to try and upstage Allison's new hotness with a big public memorial for poor dead Stephanie.<br/><br/>Gazing Abyss-ward by Stephanie's landing site at the bottom of Copper Cliff in D'Amico's quarry shows Sienna that there's something old and hungry beneath the hills, and all that blasting is causing it to stir. Only the regular sacrifice of virgins to it by the coven in town is keeping it down. The bad news that it hears them poking around and thrashes about from its watery gravel pit resting place, bloody tentacles flaying the local cop who runs up to investigate and ripping off Declan's letterman jacket before they manage to escape it.<br/><br/>Up on Copper Cliff, reliable make-out spot Coven Rock seems like as good a place for a picnic as any, and Zed has no trouble inducing Allison to accompany him there, as Ophelia lurks nearby to watch the fun. A simple strangulation goes wrong when something in the ground takes hold of her and fights him, hard. Ophelia rushes in to help, and they're both clocked hard before Zed manages to sink his teeth into her guts and chew through her spine. Ophelia is getting off on the carnage, but as the blood drains through the crevices into the rock, the Tyrant chastises her for waking something up that was better left undisturbed. She and Zed stagger out, leaning on each other, soaked in blood and bile just as Jackie, the Chorus, and stupid Constable Andy top the hill singing 'Candle in the Wind.'<br/><br/>(In short, pitching a Monsterhearts Con game as "We're gonna do a pilot for the coolest, bloodiest HBO teen monster series ever" seems to work OK.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375095/#Comment_375095" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T09:53:54+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  9:53AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome write-up, Jim.

It was exhausting, in its own way. For each folder, you need to: fold twenty sheets of paper by hand, stencil the Monsterhearts logo onto the folder cover using silver sharpee (which takes a couple minutes to do right), carefully cram the folder full of the sheets (it's a tight fit!). It takes a surprising number of minutes to do each folder (and there's 100 folders to do).<br/><br/>This is my round-about way of saying: your hard-copies will be in the mail super soon! I'm assembling the preorder stuff right now.

One dude was a little frustrated at first by the 'constraints' of the Witch (he wanted a bunch of hand-wavy magic that I felt was overstepping a bit), but everyone was engaged, enthusiastic, and really got into their characters. (One really gratifying thing was that it was the first game to fill up, several people at the table were super-psyched to see it being run, so it's definitely got some buzz!)<br/><br/>I totally forgot to highlight stats. : P<br/><br/>Though that didn't really matter because we only had 3 hours to play so never really got close to an advance. In future, my plan is to explain how highlighting works, and arrange to have the game break 60-90 minutes from the end (of a trad 4-hourCon slot) and just have some time pass and tell them to take an advance regardless of accumulated xp.<br/><br/>The Homeroom seating chart is a fantastic idea generator and really involves the players. I had them sitting in a biology lab with the two-person tables with the sinks. Everyone picked where they sat, but then said who sat next to the next PC at the table. They were sticking each other with awkward and undesirable lab partners right from the get-go.<br/><br/>For play, we didn't have time to do a whole town from scratch, so I took an approach that split the difference between a cold start and 'Misty Harbor'. I pegged the setting as a wealthy CT suburb, and printed a list I laid out on the table, with locations in town down one side, and some of the people you might find in those places down the other. (Example: "Mill Brook Pond/Park: Dereck the Lifeguard, the skate rats, Mike the Ice Cream Truck guy") I also laid out a list of the Top 50 US Baby names from 1995 (for both boys ans girls) for inspiration for names of current High School students. I found that not having a pre-done map freed us up to place stuff where we wanted for the one-shot.<br/><br/>I created two broad and easy-to-adapt menaces with 2 custom moves each and just slotted them in. The 'suicide' grabbed their attention right away, so I never even brought the other menace into play (I'm going to keep it close to the chest in case anyone reading gets a chance to play it). <br/><br/>I'd love to hear about other play aids people found useful. I guess I get the criticism I occasionally see that AW and its clones are hard to run as one-shots, but I have found that as long as you pitch it as a 'pilot' to a cool series and that there will loose ends and maybe even a cliffhanger at the end, players are fine with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376911/#Comment_376911" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-07T08:01:00+00:00" title="May  7, 2012  8:01AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jim Crocker</cite>I had them sitting in a biology lab with the two-person tables with the sinks.
