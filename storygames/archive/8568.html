Let me know if this is somehow wrong, and we'll revise.<br/><br/><b>F - the broken bridge</b><br/>The voluminous underground stream runs through a large, echoing cave here. It's dark and the noise from the water drowns most voices. There used to be a large stone bridge here high above the river, built by those who came before, but now most of the old structure has crumbled away. The river cavern itself is pretty large, the river has discernible shores and gorge walls ranging from a couple of feet to a dozen several hundred feet to either side of the bridge. Upriver the river comes out of an underground stream, but downriver a man might survive a swim through the rocky, dark passage out to the estuary. The distance would be over a mile, though, so all but the most robust would surely succumb to a watery grave if the river swept them away.<br/><br/>The river is inhabited by Brackish, which are essentially Deep Ones adapted to freshwater streams. They come from a deep estuary downriver and have established a semi-permanent trade route on the river, which originates in Carcosa, upriver. The structures of the old bridge are large enough that a half dozen Brackish rest in the underbridge structures most of the time on their way up or down the river. There is also one Slough present half the time - a sort of Brackish sheriff/ranger type that keeps the whole river section safe for the Brackish, so might be travelling somewhere when the characters come by. There is also a small chance that a large underwater barge is being dragged laboriously by slaved river dolphins up the river or floated down the river (the dolphins are considered delicacies in Carcosa, so it's a one-way trip for them) if a character stays to observe for long - this is a quarterly event for this river, roughly. Finally, there might be 1-3 Brackish merchant types with underwater storage lairs and semi-permanent residence if the rest of the dungeon has creatures with interest in crossing the river or other trade - the Brackish are unlikely to allow crossings without some sort of toll or other compensation from the other monsters. (Adapt the number of merchants and treasure based on whether the rest of the dungeon ends up having any interest in cross-river activity.) The Brackish speak a dialect of the Deep One language, as well as the occasional other monster languages and are capable of trading and negotiating with other monster races.<br/><br/>The bridge could be used to cross the river precariously with some rope and acrobatics. More solid solution requires bringing in wood from somewhere and figuring out how to prevent the Brackish from dismantling any makeshift bridge structures that are left unguarded. The Brackish are an opportunistic lot, but suspicious of new things - they'll negotiate and even sell services to monsters, but heroes will have to manage to encounter them on their own level to build enough trust for any relationship but mutual predation. Avoiding the creatures is an option for characters who never find reason to descent down near the river - in fact, even noticing that they are there is unlikely, unless characters stumble on them while drawing water from the river or they decide to reveal themselves.<br/><br/>Fighting with the Brackish in a manner that makes the bleed copiously in the river will bring a war party of them in a day or so from the estuary as they taste the kinblood in the river water. Even cunningly disposing of them is not a permanent solution, as the river traffic is relatively heavy - new Brackish will come by in a day or two if not sooner.<br/><br/>Elsewhere in the dungeon there might be some items relevant to the river. One of these are the amber stones used by dungeon denizens as crossing passes with the Brackish - presenting such a stone to them as payment (and being a creature the Brackish are willing to trade with) would obligate any Brackish currently under the bridge to help the client in crossing the river once. The Brackish even have a raft of sorts downriver for the purpose, although getting it up here would take an hour or so. Another pertinent item is some magic for water-breathing and swimming. Useful for anybody wanting to engage the Brackish on their own grounds, or wanting to travel the river up or down.<br/><br/>The river shores (which begin a couple hundred feet upriver where the stream comes out from solid rock and continue all the way downriver to the estuary, as we remember from above) are mostly sandy and rocky, except for some shoals that grow with freaky underground reed. These reeds are white and probably used for poison-making, spirit flutes or some such weird stuff by the Brackish, who harvest them from time to time. Probably poisonous to eat or handle too much. The river gorge plateaus on both sides as sort of ledges that range from a couple of feet to a dozen in width. There's not much on the upper ledges on either side of the river, except for the bridge ends themselves and the crumbling, precarious stairways on both sides that lead up and away from the river.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189884/#Comment_189884" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-24T23:29:44+00:00" title="January 24, 2009 11:29PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2009 11:33PM by akooser.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bingo Eero.

Hired by a third party (a rather frightening illusionist) to terrorize the surrounding area, they sense that the arm of the law is likely to reach for them soon and they're ready to move on. Half the band, including Scurflax their leader, wants to wait for their considerable payoff (which is late), and the other half wants to quit the caves now with their loot (which is buried in the back of this cave).<br/><br/>The bandits are numerous and well-armed and provisioned, but months of successful raiding have left them somewhat careless. Guards are likely to be lax and may even be drunk if Scurflax is asleep. Nevertheless, they are all brutal killers and willing to fight.<br/><br/>Scurflax is a cunning and dangerous man, but a pragmatist. Under the right conditions he may negotiate or even cooperate with adventurers, though his greedy nature is likely to get the best of him if they think they have treasure on hand. He and his band all fear their employer terribly, and will not willingly cross him or reveal his identity. The Illusionist has briefed Scurflax on the contents of the dungeon up to the bridge, and Scurflax has notes to this effect in his private possessions.<br/><br/>There are several bedrools towards the rear of the cave. An overturned cart serves as a table in the center of the room. A curtain shields the light of a small cooking fire from spilling out into the outer room. A small sinkhole in the corner of the cave is being used as a privy by the brigands. If dug out, however, the body of an unfortunate adventurer may be found with a useful magical item.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189907/#Comment_189907" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-25T11:16:07+00:00" title="January 25, 2009 11:16AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>A: The Drop</b> The only obvious way in is this straight drop.

The artfully carved marble walls, though crumbling, stand in stark contrast to the unhewn walls of the caves in area <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> and C).  The carvings depict the complex' original purposes and builders, before it fell into decline.  A well was built here, so that soldiers and messengers could fill up their skins before venturing forth to do the complex's business.<br/><br/>As the complex's inhabitants fell into corruption and wickedness, they began practicing foul rites, including ritual drowning of any heretics found among their ranks.  The drownings were performed in this stagnant well, and the bodies were left to rot.  The spirits of souls so killed could not traverse running water, and thus could not then trouble those still in the tower across the bridge.<br/><br/>One of those killed here was an over-ambitious demon-summoner named Kimmaroth, whose powers were such that the complex's masters saw fit to have him eliminated.  Kimmaroth's spirit persists, vainly seeking some vague sort of revenge.  Scurflax's employer, the Illusionist, grew tired of negotiating with Kimmaroth on a daily basis as he travelled through, and so he sealed the well with magic runes of the flimsiest variety.  While this prevents Kimmaroth's spirit from actually leaving the well, he can menace anyone who gets too close.  His voice, however, can be made to seem like its coming from anywhere within the room.  Kimmaroth will beg, cajole, lie, and do anything he can to get passers-by to disturb the runes that bind him.  If the runes are disturbed, Kimmaroth's spirit will be free to roam the complex in search of fresh victims.  Additionally, if the Illusionist who bound him is slain, the runes will expire instantly.<br/><br/>Kimmaroth's one notable weakness is that as one who dealt with demons, he can be bound to contracts and sworn oaths.  If he cannot trick someone into accidentally disturbing the runes, he will try to negotiate a deal.

Two of them completely block the entrance to the northern passage, except for a tiny space. The stalagmite creatures cannot move, but they can cause hands formed from earth to rise from the ground to grasp things for them. <br/><br/> Using this ability and their placing, they operate a toll- charging those who would pass through the hall a gem (or two, if the prospective traveler tries anything funny). Once their toll is paid, they lower themselves into the ground long enough to allow one person to pass- if another tries to get by for free they quickly rise out of the ground again, impaling the freeloader from below- not a pleasant experience. Even someone managed to get through without being impaled, the elementals would use their stone hands to try and grab the person and toss them into the well. However, if someone was unable to pay, but judged by the elementals to be trustworthy, they might allow them to pass for free in exchange for some of the gems from the bottom of the well- the elementals are acutely aware of their existence and have been longing for them since they laid to rest there, yet are unable to get them using their stone hands, since the gems are submerged in water.<br/><br/>Interestingly, they have recently been being paid to <i>not</i> allow things to pass. The bandits have been paying the elementals to stop people up, so that those who wander into the cavern will have no choice but to face down the bandits. Although Scurflax originally objected to the idea of giving up precious gems to the elementals, their employer realized that preventing people from passing would protect him (since would be attackers wouldn't be able to reach his lair further north in the cavern) and so he offered to pay the elementals himself. However, unbeknown to everyone except the illusionist, the gems he has been using to pay the elemental's toll are really just plain rocks disguised with magic. No one knows what might happen if the elementals were to find this out, but one could imagine that they would be less than pleased- perhaps enough so to bury the entire cavern out of rage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189915/#Comment_189915" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-25T13:33:38+00:00" title="January 25, 2009  1:33PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You all rock.

From the initial balcony and stairs, all that can be perceived is a sense of great open space.  When the temple was still in active use, before the eventual slide into depravity and dark rituals, this room was well lit by hundreds of oil lamps, the better to appreciate the beautiful murals that decorated the ceiling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe construction here is eerily precise, a giant circular bore leading deep beneath the ground, unmarred by signs of carving or stonework.  The ceiling, although out of sight above, has become the home of a sizable colony of bats, which may be attracted to any sound or light.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough the chamber itself appears to have been seamlessly bored out of the surrounding rock, the staircase which spirals around the outer edge is more easily recognized as made by the hand of man.  Worn flagstones wind down the outer edge of the chamber, leading down into the darkness.  There is no sign of a railing, but there are occasional blasphemous carvings or murals defacing the smooth stone of the outer walls, clearly a remnant from the evil end this complex eventually came to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans%20Andersen" title="Hans Andersen"><img alt="Hans Andersen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans%20Andersen">Hans Andersen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189936/#Comment_189936" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-25T21:19:28+00:00" title="January 25, 2009  9:19PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweet.

The Machine Room.  </b>This vaulted chamber has a rusted metal grid for a floor, above a roaring artificial cataract of the underground stream, which is connected to the main flow by a stone sluice.  From above, it's clear that the bend formed by the sluice has captured dozens of the Brakish's amber stones (and other shiny things), although retrieving them would require removing part of the floor and braving the torrent.  The room itself is thick with ancient machinery whose purpose is easily determined by an engineer - there is a waterwheel, long raised above the flow, and raceways for a series of heavy cables that are currently missing.  It is the mechanical guts of a very ancient elevator, built  in a scale not quite human, whose platform lies dormant behind a locked ornamental door to the north.  The waterwheel is functional and can be lowered and raised.  A series of gears and cams allow the engine to be reversed, and all that prevents the elevator from functioning is the installation of a pair of cables - stout ones, by the look of the raceways, and very, very long, by the size of the massive spools. It's apparent that this was built by someone who needed to get to the bottom of the pit regularly, but couldn't or wouldn't use the adjacent shaft for some reason.  It's obviously older than the stairs but younger than the Deep Tower itself.  <br><br>This all presupposes a careful analysis by a competent engineer, of course.  If random fools start turning levers to see what happens, roll 1d6 and consult the following table:<br><b><br>1:  </br></b>The waterwheel lowers, drawing enraged Brackish from the river - the pounding hurts their delicate tympanum.<br/><b>2:  </b>The cable spool activates, oscillating wildly without cables and causing the rusty metal floor to collapse in spots.  Adventurers will have to find a way out or be sucked into the cataract below, with heavy metal debris raining down.<br/><b>3.  </b>A multi-ton counterweight falls straight through the floor, punching a man-sized hole in the grid floor, blocking the exit and disturbing the cataract's flow upward.  The chamber will flood in minutes.<br/><b>4.  </b>Gears grind to life, crushing generations of toxic mold into an aerosol powder that fills the room with deadly poison.<br/><b>5.  </b>An ancient cam groans under the strain of motion after centuries of rest, sending rust and the pulverized husks of dead giant spiders  pouring down - but no other ill effect.<br/><b>6.  </b>The machinery shudders to life, alerting <i>something </i>far below.  From the narrow cable raceways comes a distant scuttling noise and a soft, iridescent light.  The chittering of thousands of hard-edged claws increases in volume, and the light begins to brighten....                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190109/#Comment_190109" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-26T16:50:08+00:00" title="January 26, 2009  4:50PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            allright so this is wrapped up.
