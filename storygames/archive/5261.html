The linked wikipedia article lists a number of learning models, but there seems to be a general categorization of people who learn by doing, hearing, and/or seeing. The point has been put forward that game books can do well by incorporating awareness of all these styles into their presentation of rules.<br/><br/>I get that, and I do hope to use this knowledge to present rules more clearly in my own work, but I'm curious about the other end of the educational relationship.<br/><br/>One of my goals for Do is to empower each player/reader to also become a <i>teacher</i> of the game to others. Towards that end, I'm curious if there are styles of teaching, as a counterpart to the styles of learning. I suppose those styles would be "teaching by doing," "teaching by saying," and/or "teaching by showing."<br/><br/>If there are no such styles formally defined, how would you define them? How do you teach your games? What advice would you give differently styled teachers on how to teach a game to others?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess" title="Darcy Burgess"><img alt="Darcy Burgess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://home.ca.inter.net/~krunch/PBP/gc07/pics/icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess">Darcy Burgess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118644/#Comment_118644" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-08T18:39:56+00:00" title="January  8, 2008  6:39PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Wow, Daniel...ask a tough one, why doncha?

It should be noted that in both those games those parts are both really fun and make a giant difference to what comes afterwards, in addition to being stripped-down versions of the "real deal".<br/><br/>Some assistance in making a first session would be good too.

They've never encountered/heard of D&amp;D or the like. This person, I think, has become fairly rare due to increasing cultural awareness of such a medium (film, CRPGs, books, work etc).<br/><i>False beginner:</i> Someone who knows basic ideas and concepts surrounding RPGs, such as dice or the idea of playing characters within a shared narrative. In terms of teaching an RPG, I imagine this person is more the norm rather than the exception.<br/><br/><b>Student's needs:</b><br/><br/>To become familiarized with the underlying skeletal system of a game in order to participate and enjoy that game to its fullest. This may involve a spectrum of needs from absolutely minimal structural awareness (I'll tell you what to roll, just tell me what you want to do) to complete understanding and ability to utilize every aspect of the structure being used.<br/><br/><b>Teaching needs:</b><br/><br/>By determining who your student is and what they need, the most appropriate level of teaching can be pitched to the student and (hopefully if the level has been judged correctly) the student will be able to absorb, understand and reiterate the concept taught.<br/><br/><b>Teaching methodology:</b><br/><br/>Try to have a small group to teach and use any experience already within the group as peer teaching, but monitor to ensure what is being shared is consistent.<br/>Teach a single concept rather than the entire game. Break down the game to be taught into sections, combat, conflict or task resolution, dice mechanics, elements of character etc.<br/>Once the concept has been explained, get the group to practice that concept. Establish a mini scene which directly ties into the concept just taught, and have the group play it out with the players as PCs and NPCs. The teacher should not be involved at this stage in direct play, rather as a stand-back monitor answering questions and ensuring everyone is comfortable with the concept just taught. If necessary this can be repeated with increasingly more complex situations as the confidence of the group grows.  <br/><br/>This really isn't anything new and is simply the rehashing of some old TEFL techniques and can be used for small concepts right up to major aspects of a game. The time taken also varies based on the student, their pre-existing ability and the complexity of the concept being taught. But again, I'm sure this is all old-hat.<br/>John                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118771/#Comment_118771" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-09T09:07:25+00:00" title="January  9, 2008  9:07AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reading through these comments, I'm seeing a common goal of helping teachers facilitate the student's actual play. Looking back at my first post, I think I was mistaken in saying that the counterpart of "learning by doing" is "teaching by doing." It would seem that style is better described as "teaching by <i>letting others</i> do."<br/><br/>The extreme end of this style might be tossing a kid in the deep end of a pool to teach them to swim. Or, as has been mentioned in the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5224" rel="nofollow">Boardgame Theft</a> thread, this could also be providing the bare instructions without any analysis or advice.<br/><br/>I haven't played Portal yet, but the reviews imply that it is designed in this style, but presents each step of gameplay in such small, palatable increments that the learning curve is exquisitely gentle.<br/><br/>So incremental education, combined with an ample supply of the play aids as described by Darcy and JD, sounds like it's the best advice for that style of teaching. (My guess is that this advice would apply equally to all styles though.)<br/><br/>I'm super-interested to hear advice for teachers and learners of different styles.

Briefly (and from memory), the structure is 'Presentation' whereby the teacher introduces the topic by demonstration, explanation and elicitation of prior student knowledge. Once the concept is 'packaged' to a certain extent, the lesson moves to 'Practice' via firmly contained and structured roleplay scenes which serve to allow the student to practice the concept under supervision and with constant teacher/student feedback. Lastly, by running a more freely structured scene or adventure, the student is able to demonstrate a working understanding of the concept. This 'Production' stage would become increasingly complex as more concepts are introduced. the Presentation and Practice stages could conceivable take about an hour, dependent on the complexity of the concept being taught.<br/><br/>John<br/><br/>[edit]Realised I have a basic inability to count.[/edit]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118845/#Comment_118845" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-09T13:24:30+00:00" title="January  9, 2008  1:24PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>or something.</blockquote>\nWord.

Giving examples where possible.<br/>\n  When teaching in general, I try and use a mental checklist. Explain what to do, show how to do it where possible, and explain why it is done that way. I find that you can "get through" to people who learn by doing when you explain why it is that way. In this way you can, sort of, get to the heart of the matter with this learning style, without plunging them into the deep end. Of course the goal of any teaching is to show them how to do it themselves. So naturally, people that learn by doing get their fill at the end of the training. The goal is to prep them with the right tools so they don't make any common mistakes...<br/>\n  I hope that helps.<br/>\nDave M<br/>\nAuthor of Legends of Lanasia (Still in Beta)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118908/#Comment_118908" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-09T23:38:49+00:00" title="January  9, 2008 11:38PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite>The extreme end of this style might be tossing a kid in the deep end of a pool to teach them to swim.</blockquote>\nYeah, they did that to toddlers when I was growing up. Unfortunately, even to this day I don't float. The teachers said I would come up eventually. Eventually, my dad dove in and pulled me off the bottom of the pool and told them they were complete fucking lunatics and took me home.<br/><br/>To keep this remotely on topic, Josh Waitzkin (of <i>Searching for Bobby Fischer</i> fame) has a new book out that has some discussion about teaching and how people learn. If you've heard him speak or read anything by him, you know that he's got a strong zen vibe to his thinking too.
