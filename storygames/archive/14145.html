DOW gives socially strong characters teeth but only in the immediate term. Socially strong players still very much have an advantage in the long term.<br/><br/>In BW, I'm pretty lax about allowing DOW compromises to influence the outlook or attitude of NPCs. So if I have a thing where, like, a player wants to arrange a trade agreement with an NPC vizier and the vizier wants the player to sign himself and his friends on as members of his guard: the player loses the DOW but gains a compromise, so I'll offer that the vizier is positively disposed to the PC, impressed by his business acumen, and will be happy to hear more about the trade arrangement after they get back from doing a thing with his guards. I'll even make it mechanical and offer a linked-test bonus to the PC's dispo at that time.<br/><br/>Once I've done that a bit with NPCs, I find that the players feel more-okay with adjusting their characters' attitudes toward one another as compromises.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20McNeilly" title="Chris McNeilly"><img alt="Chris McNeilly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20McNeilly">Chris McNeilly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320770/#Comment_320770" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-15T10:23:09+00:00" title="April 15, 2011 10:23AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Even without specific stakes for maintaining cordiality, I'd be curious to know why you or your GM feel compelled to always interpret the result as an aggravated NPC.<br/><br/>Is it not ever possible to use your social skills to convince someone of the merits of your stance and even change their mind without them being pissed off afterwards?<br/><br/>If you've used a skill such as Charm or Persuasion or the like, I would imagine that the default result would be a civil and agreeable understanding.

There are a great many arguments without lies or threats where one side will concede to well-argued points - but only grudgingly and seeing themselves as pushed.  For example, many though not all successful salesmen are seen as pushy even by the people who buy from them.  <br/><br/>In Burning Wheel, our Duels of Wits usually came across as this sort of barely accepted argument.  The things that gave that impression include (1) I would always keep bringing up points to support my original position, and (2) I would never concede anything until I had won my main point.  My character was never rude, but she always pushed for her way - and would only concede others' points basically after she had won her main point (i.e. final compromise).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320867/#Comment_320867" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-15T20:06:44+00:00" title="April 15, 2011  8:06PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>This is split off from<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14121&amp;page=1#Item_77" rel="nofollow"><b>Social skill that isn't obnoxious aggression</b></a>.
