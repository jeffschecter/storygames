If you see one please tell me so!<br/><br/>Ok basically this is used for a GMfull system that gives you the basics for framing scenes with a challenge incorporated, right from the beggining of the game. The basic challenge crated is nothing from the other world: a random monster attacks, crossing through a dangerous/unstable terrain, some trouble with a faceless NPC, etc. The challenge doesn't complicate much beyond that point and if the players are lucky and handle their resources with care they should be able to overcome the challenge with no consequences.<br/><br/>This is also meant to help players learn the basics about GMing. But here comes the twist: Past the first turn they "learn a new GM power". They get to choose from a list of different things they can add now to the tools they use to create challenges. Like "the next challenge is hidden from sight and the player needs to succed in a spot roll before solving it or take damage" or "now something dear to the character is involved in the challenge and they can lose it if they don't succeed"<br/><br/>Since every player would get to choose something different, challenges are going to become more varied as the game progresses. Of course, you can stick to the ones you feel safer using until you see other players go creative on different tools. I know is a little like Tom Sawyer's trick but it's supposed to work for newcomers. I would also like to have players earn these GM abilities, but I'm afraid that could make the game slower unless I make purchasing those abilities easier, or the goals needed to unlock the abilities easier to complete. Any ideas?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372252/#Comment_372252" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-10T18:14:04+00:00" title="April 10, 2012  6:14PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would a set of GM Powers flash cards to hand out make it more addictive to try new things?  :-)<br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GregPogor" title="GregPogor"><img alt="GregPogor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_e5387V2_bKU/TVEgYJ8ZWtI/AAAAAAAAAcw/CFb4Akfg5SE/avatar_storygame_small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GregPogor">GregPogor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372355/#Comment_372355" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-11T09:09:05+00:00" title="April 11, 2012  9:09AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might want to have a look at <i><b>Poison'd</b></i>. There's a basic situation in play, and the GM can bring more situations (which fit on a cue card) depending on what happens in the fiction. So the pirates are captainless, on a broken ship, with a navy ship coming at them \u2014\xa0simple problems (!). But as the try to solve that, they'll do some things that will trigger other situations (like "if you come to shore and the crew is in Malcontempt, bring the Spies event on the table").<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the situations unlock as the players learn the game and the plot thickens accordingly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
