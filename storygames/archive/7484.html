When I run it again I will definitely take more time and add more color.  <br/><br/>Other than that, the game is pretty simple.  One thing I didn't realize until after reading some of Vincent's posts is that the GM can introduce any of the Cruel Fortunes at any point in play so long as there is fictional lead up to the event.  One simple example is describing a storm in the distance and throwing out Urgent: The Storm.  Urgency is really your key to mixing things up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166361/#Comment_166361" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-31T17:40:09+00:00" title="August 31, 2008  5:40PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Georgios, what are your feelings about the game at the moment, and how it plays?<br/><br/>The massive pitfall to avoid is: this is <i>not</i> a board-gamey mechanical game, where the mechanics tell you exactly how to proceed from one scene to the next. <br/><br/>Vincent explains it well in the GM advice section (in the GenCon version): the rules are "watching over your shoulder" as you invent the fiction. So you sit around with your friends, saying what happens, but the mechanics kick in when there's a fight/somebody's brutal/somebody makes a promise/etc.<br/><br/>You sometimes have to make instant GM rulings! Like, if someone tries to sneak up on another pirate and stab him? You'll have to decide exactly what rolls are made. Ambition vs Something for the stealth, sure, but does the victim get to call for a fight? Or is he just an unsuspecting victim, subject to a Brutality vs Ambition roll? Is the wound a deadly wound? You'll have to do instant rulings. It's cool, just decide.<br/><br/>The rules for fighting are different from other games. Things to remember:<br/><br/>* You never, ever set stakes. If a player says "I want to fight the guard, but I really want to knock him out"? He can't. Fight or don't fight, those are the options.<br/>* Fighting's really deadly. This is fun.<br/>* There's...more stuff I've forgotten.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166666/#Comment_166666" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-02T14:12:00+00:00" title="September  2, 2008  2:12PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the game turned out to be a little disappointing. I mainly chalk that up to only making sense of the rules after having seen (and misapplied them) in action. <br/><br/>Fights turned out to be very confusing. Mostly because not once did the pirates engage in an evenly matched fight. (I don't think this was intentional, it just seemed to happen by accident.) But this made it harder to figure out how fights are supposed to work. We fell back on freeform storytelling more often than not. Which I wasn't happy with, considering that trying out the rules was one of the main reasons for running Poison'd that day. <br/><br/>How to calculate Brinksmanship for anyone that isn't a single NPC was another problem. I was working with the ashcan, which doesn't address this question at all. Having since had a look at the First Edition, I'm still not 100% sure how things are supposed to work. I guess every fight is treated as a one-on-one affair? So mobs, ships or fortresses don't get their own Brinksmanship rating and only provide Profile (and thus by extension X's) for the NPC side. The pirates in a way only engage the leader or captain of the NPC side.<br/><br/>Additionally, I overlooked the crucial difference between a deadly wound and being killed in a fight. The latter being something that cannot actually happen based only on an unlucky roll. There's always the option of striking a bargain to survive. Not to mention that NPCs escalating in a fight was a little tricky, without anything to hold them back but my judgement of the fiction. <br/><br/>Apart from that, there was one thing that the "character roleplayers" in our group didn't like, which the "mischief roleplayer" did like, ironically. Both observed that the characters' stats push the character into a certain pattern of behaviour. Doing things really only made sense, if you had a chance of scoring X's this way. Otherwise the chance of stumbling into a fight without any X's was too high. And as it turns out, going into a fight without any X is pretty dangerous. The "character guys" didn't like having these restrictions put on them, while the "mischief guy" liked that it forced him to play his character consistently (instead of just being random and unpredictable when he felt like it). <br/><br/>All in all, I got a very strong OD&amp;D-vibe off this game. Which might be because I've been reading the OD&amp;D booklets recently, but I think the way the fiction and the rules play off each other, the very free-wheeling nature of the game, the emphasis on following the fiction or the GM's hand in the fiction and the strong tendency to build up some momentum before heading into fights maps very nicely to OD&amp;D. At least in my mind. <br/><br/>Anyway, I'm still chewing on the game for a while. Trying to figure out how to handle it, but even though I was a little demotivated about running it again at the end of yesterday's game, I'm quite eager to give it another try soon. Although this time I think I'll prep a dozen or so NPC, crew, ship and fortress stats. Interrupting the game to flip through the rule booklet and writing up names and numbers really threw me off. In fact I'll probably have to copy, rewrite and re-arrange most of the information in the book to keep it handy during the game. I think I had to look up what kind of action requires what kind of roll at least half a dozen times. Not to mention the rules on X's and Cruel Fortunes. <br/><br/>For being only 20 pages long, there's a lot of rules to keep track of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166704/#Comment_166704" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-02T18:20:35+00:00" title="September  2, 2008  6:20PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, man, that's sad.

So.<br/><br/>In the First Edition, as I understand it, NPC Brinkmanship doesn't matter as much as it did in the ashcan. Remember how, in the ashcan, you used to roll dice equal to the NPC's Brinkmanship? You don't do that any more. Instead, you roll 6 dice, plus or minus the difference in Profiles. This means you don't have to worry about the Brinkmanship of, say, an NPC ship: you just roll 6 dice, plus or minus the Profile difference.\n<blockquote>Additionally, I overlooked the crucial difference between a deadly wound and being killed in a fight.

The bargaining is fun.<br/><br/>Being killed in a fight <i>can</i> happen as the result of an unlucky roll, I think: the third level of escalation of Sword vs Sword is "being killed outright". To me, that's instant death, no chance to bargain.\n<blockquote>Apart from that, there was one thing that the "character roleplayers" in our group didn't like, which the "mischief roleplayer" did like, ironically.

Yes, the game pushes you into a certain pattern of behaviour. That's the whole point. (That's the beauty of it, I think).\n<blockquote>Anyway, I'm still chewing on the game for a while.

I find they're very rewarding, once you do.

Looking back, I think we overlooked the fact that the outcome of a fight was supposed to be slightly unpredictable. That knocking out an NPC, can't just be done with a success roll or with winning a fight. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite><br/>In the First Edition, as I understand it, NPC Brinkmanship doesn't matter as much as it did in the ashcan.

This means you don't have to worry about the Brinkmanship of, say, an NPC ship: you just roll 6 dice, plus or minus the Profile difference.</blockquote>\nHmm. I've found this sentence from the First Edition very confusing:<i> "[The GM] takes up dice for your compared Profiles, above, and sets aside dice for her character's Brinksmanship."</i> (p.7)<br/><br/>This read to me as if you had to split your (adjusted Profile) dice for some reason. But I couldn't figure out how. Since single NPCs still get a Brinksmanship rating (p.5 under Pirates &amp; Others), but crews, mobs and ships do not. So if I'm reading this right, single NPCs get their regular Brinksmanship stat. But judging by the example on page 8, it's only used to determine if the NPC will escalate the fight or not. During fights the GM's characters only use "Adjusted Profile Dice", right?<br/><br/>(That reminds me.. if mobs/crews/ships don't have a Brinksmanship rating, when do they escalate? Do you default to a leader NPCs Brinksmanship? Does the GM simply go with what makes sense?)<br/><br/>The GM also doesn't get any X's anymore for a fight. With the exception of Accursing effects. That was another thing, that made the fights go into strange directions during our game. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>See...I think this is an unfair criticism (on their part).

The rules were less of a stumbling block and the story spiralled out of control, in a good and very pirate-y kind of way. <br/><br/>It's still pretty heavy lifting for me as a GM though. Mostly because I'm not used to being that involved with the fiction as we play the game. With poison'd you never really hand anything over to the rules, like you would in pretty much any other roleplaying game I know. It is all very focussed on what's happening to and with the characters. You can never dial down your involvement, which can be a little stressful if you're not wholly committed to the characters or immersed in the story. <br/><br/>I've heard people say that they feel "creatively exhausted and spent" after a game of PTA. I never experienced that but with poison'd I know exactly what they're talking about.
