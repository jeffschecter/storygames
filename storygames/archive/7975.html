ChrisP jumped in as well and we had a go at it between bouts of grilling and eating of goodies I grabbed at the Farmer's Market this morning. C-X hadn't run the game before, Chris-P had played a coupe of times and owned a copy of the game, and I was going in cold, with just stuff I'd picked up third-hand from non-AP discussions online.<br/><br/>Chargen and initiations were held before lunch, with only minimal noshing.<br/><br/>Chris P's character: Br. Ebeneezer<br/>Br. Ebeneezer was based on Lenny from Grapes of Wrath [EDIT: D'oh! I meant  "Of Mice and Men"]. He was a slow kid who'd been "accidently" abandoned by non-faith settlers heading west by wagon train through the territory. A local steward had found him and adopted him, and his prized possessions were the Steward's old dog coat and his kids', illustrated version of the BoL.<br/><br/>Eb's initiation involved him trying to give a sermon. The instructors knew he was having a hard time with that part of th training, so he was trying to prove that he understood the faith at an internal level, even if he really wasn't literate. Unfortunately, one of the people at the sermon was his sister, also a dog, who was frankly a big bitch. Anyway, she called him out at the meeting and basically made him look like a stuttering fool. He picked up some kind of trait about doubting he was worthy to be a preacher.<br/><br/>Edit: I think he also had his trait: Dim 2d4 go up to Dim 3d4 as a result.<br/><br/>My character: Br. Azariah, a bookish dog raised in the faith from a bigger town ( maybe even Bridal Falls itself). Pretty much a city kid, or as much as passed for one. I wanted him as more of a scholar and a bit of a reluctant, unsure dog. The kind of guy who could quote verse all over the place, but maybe not good with the actual real-world problems that the people he'd be serving were going through. Ones of his prized possessions was the copy of the book of life his older religious mentor, Br. ( Elder?) Josiah had given him which contained whole huge passages of Josiah's marginalia and thinking on what those writings meant.<br/><br/>Initiation test: My question was essentially; Can I survive in the wilderness? The test involved a ride out into the badlands whereupon the accompanying dogs/instructors took my horse, left me with my gear and said, basically, good luck, we'll see you in town.<br/><br/>To add to the fun, C-X had a ginormous thunder-storm break out. So I'm there, crouched up against a rock, with my coat over my head, sopping wet, trying to start a fire so I can at least eat. Well, I'd almost managed to dig out a pit of dry area and some tree roots to use as fire wood, when water started filliing in the pit, and I was despairing pretty hard. Worse, a lightning strike hit practically on top of me. What was amazing was that, it hit a tree and kept burnig, all Old Testament style. I survived the tet and picked up the trait: God will provide d6 for this little miracle.<br/><br/>In the process, though, my mentor's book was gummed up and effectively destroyed, although I kept it anyway.<br/><br/>(C-X will have to fill in the details of the mechanics on that.)<br/><br/>Losing valued possessions later became a running theme for my character.<br/><br/>Then we all got up and ate lunch.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176293/#Comment_176293" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-25T23:19:42+00:00" title="October 25, 2008 11:19PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The town:<br/><br/>We rode up to our first town, Nazareth Summit, wherewe were greeted by a charming local teen girl named Sr. Lavina. Nazareth Summit was a little place in beautiful mountain country, hard to make a living in or grow crops on, but otherwise pretty splendid.<br/><br/>Lavina had come out to greet us with a picnic basket, so we joined her for a spell and started asking her what was up. She was pretty excited about her relation with a teen boy named Hiram, a couple years older and the Steward's son. Apparently they were due to be married, and she shyly asked if some of the "adult" fun they'd been having was a sin, to which we said "nope" since they were engaged and all. She also mentioned that her dad was encouraging another suitor ( whose name I don't recall), which sounded a bit hinkey, but we didn't think to much about it and helped her pack up stuff and head into town proper.<br/><br/>I didn't think to ask if the family name had been Whatley. I wished later I had, even if only as an out-of-character side comment.<br/><br/>In town, it turned out that we were to be guests at a local greeting celebration. The local folks didn't have a whole lot, but they put on the best spread they could muster and were very happy to have us there. We did notice that a few folks weren't quite as enthusiastic, primarily Lavina's Dad, Br. Edward, Hiram, and Boy-whose-name-I forget ( and who I'll call Other-Boy until C-X shows up to correct that).<br/><br/>Eb and myself decided to approach Hiram and congratulate him on his upcoming wedding. Naturally, we were a bit shocked to discover that Hiram had no intention of marrying Lavina and had a pretty big ego all on his own. We tried giving the by a talkin' to, but that wasn't working out so well and he gave me a good solid shove that landed me on my ass in the mud. Between Eb's vise-like one-handed grip on his shoulder and my patented "Speak softly and turn the other cheek" approach (despite my rather embarassing seating arrangement), we managed to recover the situation and Hiram agreed that he'd make a decision either to announce his intention to marry Lavina or to equally vocally break things off. He did ask to have the night to think over his decision, and we agreed that was the right thing to do.<br/><br/>Having defused that situation, we then approached Br.Edward ( Lavina's father) to discuss the situation. Unsurprisingly, Edward wasn't at all keen on the thought of his girl marrying Hiram, who he thought was basically a bad kid with an enormous ego from being the Steward's kid. Which, really, he was right about. Anyway, this too ended in a bit of a scuffle when words alone didn't work, and the end result was me and Eb chasing him down and tackling him as he was trying to run home for his gun to insure that Hiram didn't get a chance to marry his daughter. Well, we stopped him ( even though  he ended up twisting his leg pretty good in the process), and that event ended up with that poor old fella in tears about the whole thing, out there in the darkened woods. We finally got him to agree to trust god on this one, and understand the mysterious nature of things and so on.<br/><br/>Right about now, Eb and I were feeling pretty good about our work. Naturally, that wouldn't last.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176295/#Comment_176295" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-25T23:36:16+00:00" title="October 25, 2008 11:36PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Going to talk to the Steward and Lavina:<br/><br/>Eb and I split up, each one to talk to one of these two. Br. Ebeneezer seemed to be fixating a bit on the whole "sins of the flesh" discussion earlier in the day, so I felt perhaps it was for the best that he talk to the Steward about Hiram's situation, and I'd go talk to Lavina. Later events have stuck in my mind a bit more, so I'll let Chris P and Caesar-X tell you folks about that meeting and what happened.<br/><br/>Anyway, I decided to go look for Lavina, and found her down by the river crying her eyes out. I guess she'd heard about our discussion with Hiram, and was just torn to pieces at the thought that Hiram might decide to break things off. Well, I tried to talk to her, calm herdown, tell her all kinds of soothing God works in Mysterious Ways type stuff. I tried pointing to the scenes from the BoL that were embroidered on my coat abou folks who were going through tough times and how their fiath had made things work out in the end.<br/><br/>She was having none of it. She cried cajoled, mounted arguments, flirting with me, and frankly, was wearing me down to the point where I was about to give in and go browbeat Hiram into agrreing to marry her, even though I'd promised the boy the whole night to make up his own mind either way.<br/><br/>Now I was sweating. I'd already managed to defuse two situations through my brains, faith and good words, but here I was losing the discussion to this wee slip of a girl. How could that be?<br/><br/>There was only one obvious answer: Demonic Sorcery.<br/><br/>And that's when things got interesting, especially since I thought I was about to play a trump card and grab a huge mechanical bonus, only to discover how very mis-guided I was...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176296/#Comment_176296" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-25T23:44:37+00:00" title="October 25, 2008 11:44PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lavina gets her way:<br/><br/>Okay, so declaring that I've seen evidence of supernatural evil apparently invoked some sort of rule I wasn't aware of, and all of a sudden, little Miss Lavina got a whole bunch more powerful real quick. I guess when she said she'd do or give up anything to have Hiram as her husband was the final thing that let the demon all the way in.<br/><br/>Her eyes started flashing and that creepy demon voice took over. I don't even quite remember what it said to me.<br/><br/>Nothing was to be done, and I fell back on my dog training. I slapped leather and pulled out my well-made but overly ornate hogleg and prepared to send that demon back to the netherorld even it meant the death of this poor girl. I was standing right up close and practically had the barrel touching her fore-head.<br/><br/>Before my finger could move, she'd snatched my revolver and hurled in the river. I was a beaten man, muddled in my thinking, and now I would do this creature's bidding.

Most of the relevant charcatres are back at the Steward's house at the breakfast table. Me and Eb, the Steward, Hiram, Lavina, and Edward. I don't know if OtherBoy was present- I don't believe so.<br/><br/>Conversation starts, but everyone is looking to Hiram to Hiram for the result of his decision. He gives it: He's decided to marry Lavina.<br/><br/>I guess his decision snapped me back to close to my right mind. It certainly freed me from any obligation to that demon-spawn.<br/><br/>So, I outed it. I yelled that Lavina was demon-possessed. Her daddy and the Steward were shocked and tried to grab me, while I tried to figure how to force the demon's hand in revealing itself. I went for some kind of ad-hoc laying on of hands, but the Steward tried to physically stop me, even though I could SEE the evidence of that demon in her!<br/><br/>I could feel this one slipping away from my control, too.<br/><br/>So I grabbed a carving knife, leapt across the table and stuck it in Lavina's heart. <br/><br/>At which point, blood began flowing up the knife, and the rivulets turned into small tendrils and began wrapping themselves around my hand. The demonc blood that had initially splashed up and onto my dogs' coat began to ooze out and blot out, and erase the embroidered religious scenes on the front, almost with a wicked intelligence of its own.<br/><br/>Well, that changed folks reactions quick! Hiram leapt back, stupified with horror, while Eb and the Steward jumped in and helped with what was quickly becoming a full-on excorsism. Edward helped hold Lavina in place while we went to work fighting the demon.<br/><br/>We must have been doing something right, because the demon began to lose it's grip and  started to rise up an seperate from Lavina, partially manifesting physically in an ectoplasmic bit of nastiness above the girl.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Lavina was slipping away. Here abouts, Eb stepped in to use his faithiness to keep the girl from slipping away, with some prayer, invocation, and laying on of hands. The worse of it was that both Eb's hands and Lavina's body where they were began to smoke and burn.<br/><br/>Meanwhile I went for the demon, physically wrassling it up and out as best I could. I guess I managed, because, out came the demon, and if ell back at the release, lost my grip and footing, and the demon went crashing through the window, and up, out and away.<br/><br/>When I got up, Eb and the Steward were standing back from Lavina, who was awake and writhing in pain from the burned tissue. The air was still filled with the smoke, and Eb was standing back, his big hands still smouldering and raw from that hellfire that had scorched them.<br/><br/>Hiram, finally just plain fled the building at that point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176322/#Comment_176322" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-26T10:01:36+00:00" title="October 26, 2008 10:01AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The wrap up:<br/><br/>Well, folks did manage to get things back in order. They were still cleaning up the house when Eb and I prepared to ride out of town. HIs hands are scarred and a bit gnarled now, and were bandaged up. Lavina's chest wound healed all of it's own, quickly, with the casting out of the demon, and the hand shaped burn marks on her torso are becoming less visible, though still an awful pink. Her Sunday dress still shows the burn through, though, evidence of what transpired that morning.<br/><br/>Hiram, I suspect, has had his ego taken down a notch. Seein' the sheer evidence of sin's cost has scared him back on the path of the straight and narrow. Edward was last seen at the bedside of Lavina, along with OtherBoy, who was very carefully and tenderly helping to take care of the girl. Eb and I agree that Lavina is looking at OtherBoy in a whole different way now, something that seems very mutual and content.<br/><br/>Maybe next time we visit Nazareth Summit on our tour of this circuit, we'll have a far happier ceremony to perform than an excorsism.<br/><br/>And with that, Eb and I rode off into the sunset, as it were.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176334/#Comment_176334" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-26T11:59:50+00:00" title="October 26, 2008 11:59AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>There was only one obvious answer: Demonic Sorcery.</blockquote>\nYeah, well that pretty much was the turning point of the night, eh?<br/><br/>This was my first time running Dogs. I had a lot of fun and we probably screwed some things up...but damn it the Dogs saved that town!<br/><br/>Now for my rules questions:<br/><br/>1. I had mentioned to Chris and Robert earlier to let me know if they saw any actual "signs" of Demonic Influence. Should I have told them what the effect of that would be in advance?<br/><br/>2. When Robert stated that Brother Azariah saw Sorcery in Sister Lavina, was I right to roll the 4d10 of Sorcery dice and add to her pool immediately? My quick take on it was that if Azariah saw Sorcery in her, then it must be true.<br/><br/>3. Was I overstepping my bounds as a GM or deprotagonizing Robert to declare that Lavina was forcing Azariah to go convince Hiram to marry her when the Dogs had already given Hiram the night to think over his decision?<br/><br/>4. When Azariah left Lavina to go find Hiram, I was confused about what to do. It didn't really feel right to have him go right after Hiram (see question #3). And we considered having Brother Azariah have an "internal" scene where he tried to cast Lavina's influence out. But in the end, we agreed that it made more sense to have Brother Ebenezer waylay Azariah and talk him off the cliff. Ebenezer won and that felt like the right thing to do. But I still have doubts about that scene transition.<br/><br/>5. The next morning at breakfast when Robert had Azariah..ahem...call the demon in Lavina out, I was confused about the rules. Was Lavina now considered to be a "Possessed Person"? I looked through those rules (pg 129) and they didn't really seem to fit the situation. So I decided to have Azariah in conflict with the actual demon (pg 133) , and I used the 4d6+Demonic Influence (4d10) + 2d6 of helping dice from Lavina's father Edward who naturally thought his daughter was being threatened. My take was that the Dogs were really battling the demon directly and trying to force it out of Lavina.  Right or wrong?<br/><br/>6. Could someone concisely explain the Ceremony rules? It seems like you can't just use those Ceremony dice whenever you want, but I did let them use Ceremony (pg 73) when trying to exorcise the demon out of Lavina. Do they get to use all of the ceremonies that they want? Only some? We muddled through it, but that was all a bit confusing.<br/><br/>Running Dogs for the first time was draining and exhilarating all at the same time. As a GM, you swap any responsibility for the story for the need to keep the pace of the game going, especially during conflicts. Which takes a lot out of you. But we had fun and I'm really looking forward to the next town.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pete" title="Pete"><img alt="Pete" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pete">Pete</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176336/#Comment_176336" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-26T12:07:58+00:00" title="October 26, 2008 12:07PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, that is a sweet AP.

Shit man, my See might've been 'Yeah, the knife slides in easy like her whole nubile hot young flesh is made of fresh churned butter', and my Raise might've been 'The Demons let drop the veils of Pride that have been clouding your eyes and you see Lavinia for the innocent lass she really is. The Devil is laughing it up something fierce.'<br/><br/>(Like those Marvel 'What If...' comics, I often want to rewind to key scenes in the games of Dogs that I play and play out the other, diametrically opposed angles. I daresay that Lavinia was possessed so that played out pretty cool as written. Bloody tendrils erasing the sacred scripture on your Coat? Shit man, that's some good imagery.)<br/><br/>So what did YOU personally think of the session?

Fiction-wise, the outcome was certainly broadly correct (IMO-natch). The problem was more of- well, what do I, Robert do now in the game?<br/><br/>As for what I thought? Hmm. I like a lot of stuff, but I felt that the resolutions had too many back and forths. Tha part of it I just didn't dig.<br/><br/>Now the setting stuff? Top notch. I really like that part.

His draw to religion is more intellectual than emotional. He'd rather be debating and studying religion, and actively finds heresy interesting in a almost academic way. Plus, he's soft spoken and has I'm a Dog d4, so he's less-than-confident in his role as an authority. I guess his constantly losing of treasured possessions is part of some grander scheme of the Good Lord's to test him.<br/><br/>Ebeneezer has issues all of his own. He actually has a pretty big inferiority issue, and he's starting to find himself more and more interested in girls, somethng that very likely he hasn't had any first hand experience with.

I felt this was rather deprotaginizatory: Azariah (and Eb) had already agreed that the marriage was not right. Was this a fair Stake? Had Lavina actually changed his mind? Or just possessed his body?<br/><br/>I had two issues/confusions about our conflicts:<br/><br/>* In the macro view, some of our conflicts revisited earlier conflicts. Like Azariah not wanting to marry Lavina and Hiram. Robert considered a follow-up conflict vs himself to "Save vs Lavina", but that Stake had already been decided (for him). So Eb forced a conflict on Azariah, not to change his mind, but to convince him to wait until morning. That was my second favorite scene.<br/><br/>* In the micro view, I had difficulty coming up with meaningful Raises and Sees that didn't feel like "Yes you did!"/"Or no I didn't!" When a conflict's Stakes have been set, how far can I go with my Raises and Sees?<br/><br/>In our next town, I hope to use some of Eb's interests/Traits about liking animals (but being scared of horses). And some temptations of his new Trait, "Thoughts of the Flesh 1d10". His mind has been opened/corrupted by the powerful combination of Laying Hands on a nubile girl and sizzlin' demonic scars. If Eb, rather than Azariah, had consoled young Lavina by the river, I'm afraid of what might have happened. <img alt="&gt;:)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/naughty.png" title="&gt;:)"/><br/><br/>cp                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176363/#Comment_176363" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-26T21:15:26+00:00" title="October 26, 2008  9:15PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 26, 2008 10:10PM by komradebob.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>"And that booty...<b><i>Kapow!</i></b>"</blockquote>\nChris -P engages in a little anachronistic lingo as Br.

I'm curious if its the fact that she changed your mind or the fact that she made you go back on an agreement that makes it feel deprotagonizing.

Demonic Influence is general badness in the town. Its influence upon conflicts is determined by what nastiness the dogs have seen so far. <br/><br/>Injustice 1d10<br/>Demonic attacks 2d10<br/>Heresy 3d10<br/>Sorcery 4d10<br/>Hate and Murder 5d10<br/><br/>The book gives three particular cases for rolling demonic influence: When administering medical attention you add DI into the fallout roll, when there is no clear opposition roll 4d6+DI, when a sorcerer calls upon the demons for help you add DI to their side. There's actually a fourth case, when fighting demons directly, you treat it like a conflict without clear opposition.<br/><br/>So to get a demonic influence of 4d10 in your game, you <i>effectively</i> called Lavina a possessed sorceress and the GM said "yes, she is" and called upon the demons. I'm not sure Chris was intending to play it that way, but that was the effect. <br/><br/>Since Lavina seems to have been possessed as well as being a sorceress, Chris could also have declared a relationship with the demon and added those dice into the mix.<br/><br/>You, if you had any relationship dice free, could also have declared a relationship to the demons and put those dice forward.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176506/#Comment_176506" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-27T22:41:26+00:00" title="October 27, 2008 10:41PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like it went well; congratulations!<br/><br/>If the worst the Dogs have seen is sorcery, there's 4d10 Demonic Influence, but NPCs (or Dogs!) still have to call on the demons for aid to get that 4d10.  Just because the Dogs think someone's a sorcerer doesn't make them one.  What the Dogs think doesn't change who is and isn't a sorcerer; that's already set in your town writeup. (It's certainly possible that someone the Dogs are treating as a sorcerer will call upon the demons for aid to save themselves, even if they hadn't done so before. A self-fulfilling prophecy, as it were.)<br/><br/>Ceremony doesn't give dice; it sets the fallout die size for raises using the ceremony against "demons, sorcerers, possessed people, and the souls of the Faithful" which allows raises against incorporeal entities.  It's very common to combine elements of ceremony, e.g. Three in Authority calling upon the Ancients and Singing Praise to exorcise (d8) or making the sign of the tree anointing with sacred earth (d8) to protect someone from demons.<br/><br/>The answers to 3&amp;4 are between you and your players; each group should establish its own consensus as to what's reasonable or not.  Personally I try to avoid stakes involving "convincing" the PCs and try to stick with external results.  So not "Does she convince you to make Hiram marry her?" but "Do you agree to ask Hiram to marry her?" (or replace ask with more forceful verb as desired).  That doesn't mean its the only way; it's just my preference to leave the Dogs' internal mindscape purely in the hands of the player, and avoid things that feel like mind control to me.  (Short of demonic possession or the like.)  Others' milage may vary.  (And I'm sure I fall short of this standard myself, sometimes.)<br/><br/>What was the False Doctrine in the town?  Did you have time for Reflection afterwards, for the players to discuss what their Dogs had done?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
