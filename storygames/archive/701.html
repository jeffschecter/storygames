                    I had a thought about gaming as art.  <br/>
<br/>
I mostly accept that role-playing can be an art.  But it seems to me, then, a lot of people seem to confuse changes with the medium with changes in the art -- that new rules allow people to create better art.<br/>
<br/>
I disagree.  It's like saying that CGI is objectively better than a Renaissance oil painting based on the fact that a computer was involved in the first.  I think that it is important for gamers to remember that folks playing blue box D&amp;D are creating as legitimate an artistic experience as someone playing in Polaris -- that changes in the medium allow people to express themselves differently, but that those differences do not constitute superiority in an artistic sense.  That Polaris isn't better than blue box D&amp;D, it's just different -- just as computer graphics are not inherently artistically superior to oil paintings or TV is an artistic improvement over stage theater.<br/>
<br/>
Which might not apply to anyone here, but I felt the urge to say it where someone else might actually hear it.  ;)                </div>

On the one hand, I actually agree with you about blue box D&amp;D.  On the other hand, I don't think all systems are created equal.<br/>

                            You can draw with a crayon, or you can draw with a marker, or you can draw with a pencil....<br/>
<br/>
All depends on what you want your drawing to look like when you're done. If you want something subtle, detailed, and full of fine shadings of a small palette, you are going to have a hard time getting it with the crayons. If you have a big enough box and enough skill, though, you can probably do it.                        </div>

                            There is some point in what Chris is saying, but the whole subject needs huge amounts of nuance.<br/><br/>It may be difficult to say (with a straight face) that oil painting is objectively superior to CGI, but I am sure that nobody has to go far to find somebody saying just that. Some art gets more respect than others; there are cultural biases towards craftsmanship.<br/><br/>What kind of art is roleplaying? Is all roleplaying art, without exception?

                            Is all roleplaying art?  Depends on your definition of art.<br/>
<br/>
What kind of art is roleplaying?  I'd say it probably counts as a perverse kind of theater.<br/>
<br/>
What's a technical agenda?  <br/>
<br/>
What is meant by "impede"?  I ask this because the rules of, for example, a sonnet certainly "impede" one's ability to produce art quickly and easily, but it isn't supposed to be quick or easy.                        </div>

There's an interesting tidbit my art teacher told me about the way different media get different amounts of respect... What's probably the medium most respected as high art? Oil painting. What's one of the easiest media to learn? Oil painting. What's one of the most discounted, looked-down-on, media? Watercolors. But what's one of the hardest media to learn? Watercolors.                        </div>

I didn't say that system didn't matter (tho' I think that its importance is radically overemphasized in the Forge for a variety or reasons, none of which are important here), I said that if RPGs are art (and I accept that they are) then the medium through which that art is created is not an advancement in the art -- that "advances" in art allow a person to create different kinds of art but that art is not superior to the previous, more "primitive" forms of art.<br/>
<br/>
Which is not to say that system doesn't matter.  But what it matters for isn't the creation of quality -- art can be made by a caveman doing fingerpaintings on a to-be-a-French-cave-in-thousands-of-years or in a Renaissance cathedral or a person with a computer.  Quality -- artfulness -- is independent of media.<br/>
<br/>
Which, if we accept RPGs as being art, is equally true of RPGs.  Just as some modern artists create beautiful, and modern, works of art using fingerpainting techniques, and primitive tools to splatter and smear paint on a canvas in a way that would be quite familiar to a paleolithic artist, gamers can create vivid, fascinating games with "primitive" games that are equal in quality to the highest tech, most cutting edge games.                        </div>

                            Okay, the problem here is in the ambiguity of "RPG".<br/>
<br/>
Any particular instance of play of a game is ART.<br/>
<br/>
Any particular ruleset is a MEDIUM.<br/>
<br/>
Could you use cave pigments and a cave wall to create an image that evokes the awe of Jupiter on the horizon of Io?  Perhaps, but it would be MUCH more evocative using CGI tools.<br/>
<br/>
New media allow us to create art that was far, far more difficult to do with earlier media.<br/>
<br/>
If it were not so, why did the old masters nearly always use the most advanced media of their times?                        </div>

Well, that ambiguity is present in all art.  All art has a medium.<br/>
<br/>
And I said, repeatedly, that new innovations in art allow one to do new things.  I am not anti-innovation! <br/>
<br/>
Whether or not the "old masters" uniformly used the best techniques is largely irrelevant, I think.  I mean, that invalidates more modern artistic experience even if your contention was factually correct.  (By the way -- they didn't uniformly use the "most advanced techniques".  Many of the early Renaissance painters modelled their technique off of the thousand year old techniques brought over by Greek icon painters, f'rex.  You were just factually in error, there; it is also important to remember, I think, that those old masters in the Renaissance, at any rate, were trying to recreate artistic prowess a couple of thousand years old -- enter these waters at your own peril; artists are almost always the ones most influenced by past artistry.)  <br/>
<br/>
And whether or not a picture from space more evocative is a matter of opinion.  I have relatives who are archeologists and they're more impressed with the cave paintings.  Are they wrong for being so impressed?  That you are more impressed by pictures from space doesn't say much about what is better art, and I don't think you can reasonably say that people, generally, prefer pictures from space to cave paintings.<br/>
<br/>
(Also, for art based primarily on its newness -- innovations in computer graphics, for instance -- while you might find them evocative NOW much of computer graphics that was stunning and innovative at the time is swiftly forgotten as new technological advances come along.  A computer game that revolutionized the medium a decade ago is a distant memory, now.)                        </div>

<p>The reason we still call them "games" is because they are judged not as art, but by how much fun they are. And a particular game of blue box D&amp;D could certainly be more fun to its players than a particular game of Polaris to another group.</p>
<p>But is OD&amp;D better "art" than Polaris? Give me a break. Someone will always make a valiant effort to argue that cave paintings are better art than the Renaissance masters. But one of these allows for more successful communication of ideas, beauty, pathos, and enjoyment than the other. Come to think of it, OD&amp;D doesn't seem to give much of a shit about aesthetics at all.</p>
<p>Not that OD&amp;D doesn't <em>contain</em> art. Can't knock the Erol Otus.</p>

<i>Well, that ambiguity is present in all art. All art has a medium.</i><br/><br/>No, it's not ambiguous at all, not in any other medium except gaming.<br/><br/>An oil painting is not "oils"  "Cats" is not "theater" it's a play.  When we talk about a painting, we are always talking about that particular instance of that painting, and not about oils as a medium.<br/><br/><i>Whether or not the "old masters" uniformly used the best techniques</i><br/><br/>Interesting that you should use the word "best"... I said "advanced"... thank you Dr. Freud...<br/><br/>The old masters may have been trying to emulate the styles of the ancients, but they used the tools of their age.  Even if they carved in marble, they used steel chisels, not bronze.  When they painted on the walls, they used fresco, not mosaic.  When they created movable images they painted on canvas, not wood.  These are general statements, not universal; of course, you can find exceptions.<br/><br/><i>And whether or not a picture from space more evocative is a matter of opinion. </i><br/><br/>You're making a straw man argument.  I didn't say that the space picture was more evocative.  I said that IF you wanted to evoke the awe of seeing Jupiter from Io, THEN you would have a harder time using stone-age media.  I didn't say that any medium was more evocative than any other, in its own domain.  If you wanted to portray the ritual relationship between hunter and prey, in all its complexity, I doubt you could find a better medium than a cave painting.  Look at the cave painting scene in "Ice Age" and I think you'll see that even CGI artists recognize its power.<br/><br/>To bring this back around to gaming, if you want to do stories of oppression and rebellion, yeah, you can do it with blue-box DnD, but you'll get better results with My Life With Master.  If you want to do stories of authority and judgement, yes, you can do it with DnD, but you'll get better results with Dogs in the Vineyard.<br/><br/>New rules (new media) allow people to create better art <i>in areas where the new medium is strong, and the old one is weak.</i><br/><br/>Blue-box DnD was strong in one small area.  Traveller had another small area.  New games have steadily broken new ground and found new places to be strong.                        </div>

I am increasing suspecting you and I are not discussing the same thing, because I have repeatedly said that innovations in technique make it easier to new things.  I have also said that new techniques do not produce better art than older techniques.  There is no tension between my statements and what you're saying.  I agree that some games make playing certain types of scenarios easier.  I am just saying that doesn't make them artistically superior -- just different.                        </div>

I politely reject your entire point, but I have a question or two.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
You say that Renaissance masters are better than those cave painting guys.  Does that extend to the modern day?  Is Klimt inherently superior to da Vinci?  Are 21st century computer artists inherently superior to Michelangelo?<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, were Renaissance artists superior to classical Greek and Roman artists, particularly in the area of sculpture?<br/>
<br/>
And in writing, has there also been an equal change over time?  Are modern authors artistically superior to Shakespeare or Homer?                        </div>

You are relying entirely too much on analogy to make your point for you. Please point me to an actual play account of a session of OD&amp;D which would indicate it was a greater artistic endevour than any single account of Polaris, and we'll talk.                        </div>

C'mon, an actual account of a play session is not a play session.  Whether an account indicates a good game is a specious connection.  Plus, I don't frequent boards where people post EITHER OD&amp;D accounts or accounts of Polaris!  (I don't even think I'd like Polaris, and the accounts I've read of game sessions of Polaris have failed to impress me.  But this is generally true even of games I do like, such as Universalis -- the transcripts I find extremely tedious.  Indeed, the only transcripts of games I have found amusing have been amusing because they describe bad games, sort of an "oh-my-god-I-don't-believe-that-happened" sort of feeling.)<br/>
<br/>
I think my point is legitimate and I think you're avoiding the question.  Do you think that improvements in technology and technique automatically lead to improvement in the quality of artistry?  This is not argument by analogy, furthermore, if we consider RPGs to be art.  Whether or not improvements in technology and technique improve the quality of art is extremely relevant to the issue.                        </div>

Improvements in technology and technique lead to improvement in the quality of the artistry, across the universe of portrayal.  Each new medium is not so much building higher than the first, it's building in a new direction.<br/>
<br/>
Let's get out of the static arts and get into the lively arts, because roleplaying is a lively art.<br/>
<br/>
Let's say you want to put on a play, let's say, Cats.<br/>
<br/>
On the one hand, you have a Grecian amphitheater, masks, drums, trumpets, and the human voice.  No sets, no costumes besides featureless robes, no lighting besides sunlight.  It'll be really cheap to make though.<br/>
<br/>
On the other, you have a modern stage, makeup, costumes, lighting, orchestra, and sets.  You'll spend lots of money on it.<br/>
<br/>
If the experience of the first is as "good" as the experience of the second, why do they go to all the trouble and expense of using all the modern tools?  After all, art transcends such worldly concerns, doesn't it?<br/>
<br/>
The fact is, people DO want art created with the most modern tools and techniques.  Producers and directors want to have the entire toolbox available to them.   Yes, they put on plays using less than the whole kit of tricks, but they usually take at least one or two of the best tools out at some point.<br/>
<br/>
Art people like is better.<br/>
<br/>
Art people spend money on is art people like.                        </div>

<p>In any serious discussion of art, one must ultimately show examples of art. Art, by definition, cannot be communicated purely through rational discourse, one must somehow experience it. Actual play accounts are the only reasonable fascimile of that experience which we can share and distribute. If you've never even "seen a picture" of a OD&amp;D or Polaris, so to speak, then why are you using them as your examples? This seems odd.</p>
<p>Do I think improvements in technology and technique automatically lead to improvement in the quality of artistry? No, of course not, that's absurd. Art does not occur by any automatic process.</p>
<p>Do improvements in technology and technique facilitate improvements in the quality of artistry? Most certainly. It also requires suffiencent skilled creators to utilize these things.</p>
<p>In this particular case, I see the problem as being that not only does a game like Polaris <em>actively facilitate</em> the creation of a more artful narrative, a game like OD&amp;D <em>actively impedes</em> the participants from creating such a thing. The OD&amp;D group will need to drift and discard the rules substantially in order to achieve anything which might be considered, by any but the most anthropologically-minded, art.</p>
