This is one of those threads that tries to bring together advice from various people on a single topic.<br/><br/>How do you handle internal conflict in your games? In particular, stories that involve protagonists going through internal struggles than can't be externalised in obvious ways.<br/><br/>Examples would be great--what happened in play, how you (the group) handled it, and whether it worked or flopped.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166265/#Comment_166265" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-30T16:59:09+00:00" title="August 30, 2008  4:59PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mechanically, my favorite handling of internal conflict is in Burning Wheel. It's pretty obvious -- you get an Artha when two Beliefs come into conflict <i>and you play out the conflict</i> -- but it generates terrific play. First off, having a table full of conflicted protagonists is awesome for obvious reasons. I also like the fact that the Artha payoff is written in such a way that you have to play it out. It has to be obvious to everyone at the table that you're working out both sides of your situation. It's like a bang-in-a-can.<br/><br/>Practically at-the-table-speaking, this usually involves about 2-3 minutes of a player engaging in a monologue about his predicament. For me, they're big-deal moments in the fiction. So I have everyone direct their attention to the conflicted player, and allow some kibbutzing. Sometimes this leads to a strong personality at the table trying to dictate that player's decision, and that's not good (i.e. "He'd totally do X, man!"). I have yet to try and create a play rule prohibiting the behavior, because I don't want to chill the good kibbutzing that comes out of it, the supportive "Oh wow, I have no idea what decision I'd make!" or "Huh...maybe if you handle the situation in this particular way, you can split the difference and not be in conflict any more."<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166266/#Comment_166266" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-30T17:15:40+00:00" title="August 30, 2008  5:15PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We try to use acting.

If you know that Joe gets a card every time he tells a blatant lie, and he's playing the leader, and as he gives his line he draws a card ... that's useful supplemental information.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gmdice" title="gmdice"><img alt="gmdice" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gmdice.com/prodimages/02019.jpg.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gmdice">gmdice</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166274/#Comment_166274" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-30T19:11:53+00:00" title="August 30, 2008  7:11PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A good way to handle an internal conflict is with notes. We played an adventure not long ago where there was a type of possession going on in the group which bounced from character to character. From a GM perspective I gave everyone a note and they were instructed not to share what their note said with each other. The notes had names on them so it was not random. Each person read their note and one of them was notified that they were possessed. I made them read the notes outside the room one at a time so that their initial expressions could not be read.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the possessed character was to play himself as usual but when it came time to act in say combat, discovery, a task etc. he was to keep silent and offer no advice. The possessed also had to do specific tasks and attempt to mess up. Once they past a story point I would give out new notes changing who the possessed character was. Again they could not talk about what had happen etc. It took a few exchanges for the characters to catch on to what was happening. Then the notes came allowing them to exchange information and they determined what each person had done along the way possessed and had to go back and fix it all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure if this is the type of internal strife you are talking about but you should be able to adapt the principle.<br/>\n<br/>\nRollin Rollin Rollin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166281/#Comment_166281" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-30T22:25:52+00:00" title="August 30, 2008 10:25PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wrote this game about road trips really recently, and the way it handles internal conflict worked SO WELL in play.<br><br>Your character has 3 Traits (whatever, not important for this) and 2 Futures. Futures are things that the character is hoping for or moving towards. Examples include: "I will marry Jeanie-Sue", "I'm going to drop out of school before the end of the term" and "When we get to the hotel, I'm getting a room with an in-suite spa".<br><br>Those are the only "future things" that the characters get to talk about. If it's not in your Future, you're not allowed to speculate about it.<br><br>Through play, you can address Futures in a few ways: you can just talk about it, you can have it achieved (good for you!), or you can realize it doesn't matter any more. When you realize that it doesn't matter any more, you get to cross it off. If your character crosses off both Futures, that means they are the protagonist of this story! That's the game's focal point, that moment when someone truly and fully let's go.<br><br>But working towards crossing off that Future? That's serious, conflicting business. You start steering conversations towards the things you believe in, only to get into conversations that you *want to lose*. You start framing things to highlight how you are no longer certain about the things you used to be concrete on. Everyone learns what your Futures are, and starts playing scenes to involve them in subtle ways. Maybe you pick up a hitchhiker, and he's returned from a tour of duty that kept him overseas for 8 years, and HE'S planning to marry Jeanie-Sue. And you start having conversations with him and realizing he's the better man, and that he loves Jeanie-Sue more truly than you ever did. But you of course don't say that out loud. You don't say anything *about* Jeanie-Sue to him in response. You just sit there and nod, ask about his journey overseas, and quietly cross off that Future.<br><br>The best part is that this mechanic is quiet. It's quiet, it's automatic, and it's personal. You strike your Future off when it no longer feels true to the character. But the working towards that point... that's a process of muddling up a character's life, of tempering ideals with experience, of exposing this fictional person to things they didn't think existed. In play, it worked excellently. Getting to cross off a Future felt really powerful to me. But working up to that point, that provoked so much thought and strife.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166328/#Comment_166328" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-31T12:30:17+00:00" title="August 31, 2008 12:30PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Read the crap on your character sheets about internal confict.

Not everything in the game has to be about me showing off for my friends, some of it is allowed to just be my own private fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166548/#Comment_166548" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-01T23:45:55+00:00" title="September  1, 2008 11:45PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Joe McDonald,<br/><br/>That sounds really interesting, but I'm having a bit of trouble understanding it... are you saying that each player is actually trying to set up situations that will cause their character to change their mind about their Futures? So... you have to push the character towards failure (sort of) while pretending that you're still striving to get that thing?</blockquote>\nPaul,<br/><br/>The idea is that these Futures are the only things you can <i>speculate </i>on, therefore the topics will come up quite often. And the game has a lot of conversation as opposed to action, reflection as opposed to advancement. So, in the game I played, people's Futures came up quite often and people pulled them into their petty arguments pretty quickly.<br/><br/>As such, there are a lot of points in the game where you find yourself naturally thinking, "Does this still hold true? Do I really want X more than, say... whatever I already have?"<br/><br/>The players all know that the end condition is that someone writes away both Futures, thus becoming the story's protagonist. They naturally start to play towards the <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">possibility </span></i>of  someone crossing off a Future in any given scene. Not pushing for it, just providing ground for it, should it happen. If you've got a Future, and we've pushed the story into a space which really changes the light in which we see that Future, everyone feels really satisfied when you pick up your pencil and cross it off.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166599/#Comment_166599" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-02T10:08:55+00:00" title="September  2, 2008 10:08AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe, <br/><br/>I see!
