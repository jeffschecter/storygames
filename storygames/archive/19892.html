Check out the Post World Games Protocol Game series for some ideas. Also check out Rickards game Imagine (golden cobra DL links page a is broken at the moment- yes I told them).<br/>If you want a gm, what if they were more of a facilitator? What if the role of facilitator could be exchanged during play? Would this make the game more interesting? <br/>At the moment your game focuses on the order of play. I advise you spend some time on why participation matters- is there a reason why I should change the story and if so, is there a reason why I should change it one way and not another? <br/>One way I could see it going is that the facilitator writes the scene, the players edit it in rounds as you have described and are then scored according to some clever mechanism that you devise. The winner gets to facilitate the next scene. Characters rotate according to the fallout of the clever mechanism so that during play I might be aiming to be the next facilitator or to gain editor rights over a specific character or thing but I can't have both. Thus, different objectives cause a tension that is reflected in player engagement and extension of the flow state.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dirk" title="Dirk"><img alt="Dirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dirk">Dirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440568/#Comment_440568" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-30T04:17:19+00:00" title="November 30, 2014  4:17AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 30, 2014 4:18AM by Dirk.">edited November 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for sharing! A few scattered thoughts about this.<br/><br/>Like the idea of a collaborative writing game. The document you have so far is mostly addressing the format, not saying anything about the kind of fiction you're interested in generating, which is something to think about. Not necessarily genre or setting, but something to help structure stories that are more than a flat series of consecutive scenes.<br/><br/>Second Matt's questions about the GM.<br/><br/>I'm having a hard time understanding the incentive to contradict other peoples details. It feels like your main mechanical support encourages a nay-saying behavior that would be toxic to creative collaboration. What I'd rather see is some structure for asking questions about or otherwise snowballing each other's ideas.<br/><br/>I think this will definitely require some type of metatextual communication outside of the document where the scenes are being written (like using chat in google docs), which could  have some super interesting uses. You end up with two distinct in-fiction and meta-fiction transcripts of the game, for one thing, which would be cool on its own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fantomx11" title="fantomx11"><img alt="fantomx11" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fantomx11">fantomx11</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440571/#Comment_440571" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-30T05:49:26+00:00" title="November 30, 2014  5:49AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, this is sort of an outgrowth of my experience using Google docs and skype to play more traditional role playing games.<br/><br/>I had thought of not having a GM altogether, but my thought was that the GM fills the role of directing the overall flow of the plot so that it isn't simply a series of disconnect ed scenes.<br/><br/>As far as contradictory details, the reason I included them was to allow the final scene to be determined by popular vote. I haven't actually played any of this yet, and am unlikely to get a chance in the near future.  So, I was hoping that more eyes on them might give me some insight into pitfalls and improvements.<br/><br/>I do see your point about nay saying, and the thing I want to accomplish could be done with only being able to increase stability.
