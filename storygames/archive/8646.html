It's the same text, so as before, the book includes the rules for the game, the LARP chapter, the extensive filmography and the chapter on recipes for a MRG party\u2014but I upgraded to a higher-quality printer, and also upgraded the weight of the paper for extra sumptuousness. It's positively <em>silky.</em><br/><br/>Here's the best part: the price of the book is still $24. It's important to me that I offer the highest-quality product I can, and with the current economic climate, I'd rather pay a little extra for that quality than pass the cost on to you. And in that spirit, the PDF is now $13 as well. (And don't forget the Forbidden Tiger Manual supplement, PDF only, for just $3.)<br/><br/>People who are on backorder: I'll be sending your copies within the week! I'll also have copies available at Dreamation.<br/><br/><a href="http://summerbird.wordpress.com/the-mist-robed-gate/" rel="nofollow"><strong>Buy 'em now at Summerbird</strong></a> (or get the PDF at the Unstore)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
