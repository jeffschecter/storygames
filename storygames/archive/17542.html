Because this has been true for me for the last decade I have gotten used to scaling games for solo play.  The *World games are interesting for this, and Dungeon World in particular, because (in my brief experience) they seem to almost require a variation of character types to overcome obstacles that arise in the narrative.  They also allow for Troupe-style playing where the player controls multiple PCs.  I am thinking of doing an Ars Magica-style troupe where the player has the PC and they start with a loyal team of hirelings.  Hirelings are less powerful than other PCs would be, but then again, the player is really The Wizard and I think hirelings help reinforce that about the PC.  I would establish bonds between the PC and hirelings.<br/><br/>Do you have experience with, recommendations or constructive criticism for this approach?  Would letting the player use multiple PC be a better option?                  </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Terwox" title="Terwox"><img alt="Terwox" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/nSPMQ33PX1PEF.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Terwox">Terwox</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397927/#Comment_397927" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-17T22:05:07+00:00" title="November 17, 2012 10:05PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've found running party members as NPCs with the *World games to be fairly awkward as there's no real dice system for it, personally.<br/><br/>I've played a decent bit of DW in one-on-one settings as the player and the GM, but never actually in a dungeon, and with threats essentially tailored towards one-player like you mentioned.  Fun though!  Might be worth another shot with that in mind, if your experience was brief?  (But if you what you want to play in DW requires multiple niches, then yeah, it won't work.)<br/><br/>I would expect that troupe style with the bonds would be sort of weird?  But there's nothing stopping you from just aiming bonds at NPCs instead of other PCs like in usual one-on-one play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robb" title="robb"><img alt="robb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robb">robb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397936/#Comment_397936" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-18T01:33:07+00:00" title="November 18, 2012  1:33AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've done a bit of this. Bonds with NPC henchmen/party members is IMO essential. I often rule that a helping NPC gives the PC +1. The AW gang rules give some inspiration. You can always "inflict harm as established" (hack, volley) and " reveal an unwelcome truth" (trap, lore, discern realities) via NPCs to push the action on in any way you want. CHA rolls to push henchmen to do what you want is the order of the day. WoD has the idea of henchmen specialists.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ticktockman" title="ticktockman"><img alt="ticktockman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ticktockman">ticktockman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398023/#Comment_398023" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-18T19:01:28+00:00" title="November 18, 2012  7:01PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Using the gang rules is a good idea; it hadn't occurred to me.

The player should pick one character to play at a time.  When they gain a level, they must immediately make the bolster move and switch to playing a character with which their current character has a bond.  The bolster move represents something they will be accomplishing while not being played.  The goal being to have an ensemble cast like, for example, in Goerge R. R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire books or Melanie Rawn's Exile 'trilogy.'  Characters may, but need not, be in the same locations/scenes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jbinc" title="jbinc"><img alt="jbinc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/106/nFRMKD4VH4ILG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jbinc">jbinc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398061/#Comment_398061" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-19T06:57:17+00:00" title="November 19, 2012  6:57AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ooh, I like the 'ensemble' idea! Building off that, I've done something similar in a sci-fi campaign recently. (It's a custom ruleset I'm working on but taking a bit from DW/AW). Each PC starts with two gigs they work between adventures - odd jobs, finding rumours, family they can sponge off, etc. For example, a fighter might spend his downtime working in his father's mines and trying his luck in the fighting ring, when he's not out adventuring.<br/><br/>I guess this could be a custom move in DW like:<br/>"<b>When your character has had some downtime since his last session, roll +gigs.</b> On a 10+, take +1 forward for each gig. On a 7-9, take +1 forward. On a 6, take -1 forward and cross off 1 gig - tell the group what happened to make the gig go south..."<br/><br/>The great thing about this is if things go south you have a great jumping off point for that PC's next adventure. Maybe the fighter's father's mine collapsed, and he's got to delve back into the ruins to rescue his co-workers? Also, this allows you to provide gigs as an bonus reward in adventures (as useful contacts et al.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
