But it\u2019s kind \u2018a sketchy for the time being.<br/><br/>Has anyone been in this place before or if not has some advice to give on how to manage this situation?<br/><br/><br/>Thanks in advance for all your help *bow*<br/>Red                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129679/#Comment_129679" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T07:22:53+00:00" title="February 23, 2008  7:22AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2008 7:27AM by noclue.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know its not helpful, but just wondering why O-Yanma's wife wanted to charm the other two PCs into staying with her and her husband? Now they got two roomies staying with them. My wife would never allow my friends to stay with us.<br/><br/>EDIT: I haven't played this game yet, but shit its only a couple inches of screen space, so I'll blather on. <br/><br/>That would be my answer. The four of them live together wrapped in this woman's charms until she just absolutely can't stand it any more. She realizes this will never work, in trying to save her husband for herself she has created a life that isn't worth living. And she finally realizes she has to let them go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129681/#Comment_129681" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T07:33:26+00:00" title="February 23, 2008  7:33AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2008 7:34AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think your game ended.  <br/><br/>On page 50 it says "Once a character has been Taken Out, their opponents can do whatever they want with them."<br/><br/>For the record, that's an awesome ending for a Mountain Witch game.  I hope your players got to use their Dark Fates, though.  If not, I'd think about asking them to find ways to tie them in to their miserable failure somehow.  If you are all still hot to play, start over at the base of the mountain with new Ronin, and make your bedazzled ex-PCs bad-ass henchmen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129689/#Comment_129689" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T08:10:10+00:00" title="February 23, 2008  8:10AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Was character death explicitly part of the stakes?

I mean, a lone tengu could theoretically take out a single ronin in the first act.  That would suck.</p>\n<p>So, my advice is to leave the story alone but ret-con the Taken Out result.  Call it a double-success.  Say that the ronin both fell under her spell and then add something really nasty on top of it.  I suggest something like "And many years pass before you are strong enough to break free of her spell."</p>\n<p>I'm willing to bet that your players will be so satisfied with the loss they've suffered that they won't mind the minor ret-con that allows the game to continue.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
