Desperate reactions. I'm hoping someone here gets it.<br/><br/>1) If a character has already committed to 4 actions, does that mean he can't do Desperate Reactions at all? I.e. his defense will be zero against the particular attack that he hadn't scripted any defense against?<br/><br/>2) For the option of committing two action tokens in order to get a Desperate Reaction, I take it that any tokens from the Action Pool have to be used first. The book has an example where the first token is taken from the Pool and the second from another scripted action. But what if the pool is empty to start with? Can both tokens come from another action?<br/><br/>3) There is also an option of spending one Action token to re-allocate tokens. Can you do this without first doing the "commit 2 action tokens" step? Or are these two independent choices? Edit: The significance of this, as I see it, is that if you don't have to first do the "commit 2" step, you could still keep an action token in your Pool, spend a committed one, and therefore not "go all in" and get fatigue. See also question 4 <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>4) In the example on p. 88, would Jason end up with two fatigue: One for the re-allocation, and one for "going all in" (per the fatigue rules)?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor" title="Brennan_Taylor"><img alt="Brennan_Taylor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor">Brennan_Taylor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294928/#Comment_294928" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T10:01:07+00:00" title="September 28, 2010 10:01AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I meant to answer this last night, sorry for the brief reply.

The purpose of the desperate reaction is to keep you from being boned if you fail to anticipate an enemy's attack. There should be a penalty, fatigue works. I'd charge a fatigue and let the player reallocate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elenius" title="elenius"><img alt="elenius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elenius">elenius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295214/#Comment_295214" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-29T12:52:47+00:00" title="September 29, 2010 12:52PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 29, 2010 12:53PM by elenius.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok. So do you think all of these should be possible:<br/><br/>- The character has gone all in and now wants to re-allocate. He does so, and ends up with 2 fatigue (one for all in, one for re-allocation).<br/>- The character has not gone all in and now wants to re-allocate. He does so, but keeps his remaining action token unallocated. He ends up with 1 fatigue (for re-allocation, but not for all-in).<br/>- The character has not gone all in and now wants to re-allocate. He does so, and also allocates his remaining action token. He ends up with 2 fatigue (one for all in, one for re-allocation).<br/><br/>In all cases, all the action tokens on the new action count (unlike the rules as written in some cases).<br/><br/>Does the fatigue from re-allocation happen before or after the actions have been resolved? I would vote for before (i.e. one token is moved to the Spent pile immediately), in order to make the cost a bit higher, and I think this is more in line with the philosophy behind the rules in the book. On the other hand, I assume the fatigue from going all in happens *after* the actions have been resolved.<br/><br/>You didn't comment on what happens if all the action "slots" have been taken (or no appropriate slot is available). I assume one can still use the faculty only for defense, but no aptitude/action tokens?<br/><br/>-----<br/>We had our first session last night, and I'm happy to say that no-one attempted to do any of the above <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>I did have some trouble with the conflict system, although not the trouble I expected. The trouble I expected was that I thought it would be hard to match actions up against each other and figure out what opposes what. But the actual problem was that it was very difficult to come up with non-obvious actions to script ("side bets"). And without those, the conflicts get kind of predictable and boring. I think part of it is that I need more flesh on my NPCs in order to give them appropriate "side goals", but I also think it requires a lot of fast thinking on your feet, and it's hard to be super creative for a whole session...<br/><br/>We did have some interesting magical facts created, and some very good free-form role-playing where I just sat back and enjoyed the players playing their characters bantering and arguing with each other in a pretty believable way <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I think I need to write a proper AP at some point...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor" title="Brennan_Taylor"><img alt="Brennan_Taylor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor">Brennan_Taylor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295313/#Comment_295313" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-30T02:56:54+00:00" title="September 30, 2010  2:56AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd go with options 1 and 2, for my taste. I also vote for allocation fatigue to be immediate, before reallocation results are calculated.<br/><br/>If all action slots have been taken, the person would need to change one of his actions for one of the slots, abandoning whatever previous action he had there. I rarely have all four slots fill up in a game, though, so that shouldn't come up too often.<br/><br/>It's true that the conflict system gets a little bland if people aren't creative with their actions. It takes some time and familiarity with the system to get good side bets going, but one of the tricks I use as a GM is to perform a mental action when the characters are expecting a physical one, and vice versa. That always gets people's attention. There is some thinking on your feet required, which can be difficult and tiring. I'll cop to that, for sure.<br/><br/>I'd love to see an AP!

Most of these also required a conflict to use which had two aspects, getting the item to deliver what was required and resisting the cost. As GM I'd usually go easy on resisting use and pile in on applying the cost. This is probably a perfect place to use a desperate reaction but I can't ever remember anyone using it. This might be because they didn't want to lose the extra fatigue or possibly because they'd forgotten they could do it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295456/#Comment_295456" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-30T22:12:37+00:00" title="September 30, 2010 10:12PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a player in this game.

You don't have to put all your cards on the table (nor do we).  However, as players we will be adding various facts, so you can't necessarily stick to a single pre-planned truth.

Actually, I did that wrong, we're not supposed to add action tokens for those, although you can do so *after* the reveal (unlike in regular conflicts), but all the action tokens become fatigue.<br/><br/>Also, and I had completely missed this, the rules actually do talk about simple opposed checks! Same thing as above, except both parties add their faculty and aptitude together, and you can again add action tokens after the reveal.
