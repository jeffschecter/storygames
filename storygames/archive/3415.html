In fact, I find it limiting to even say "You are reading the book, therefore you intend to play the game."  God knows there were plenty of WW splatbooks that (in retrospect) were written with no such assumption ... and that was part of their appeal!<br/><br/>I've found it strangely freeing to think about writing a game as a <i>story that teaches the game</i>.  You get to make <i>less</i> assumptions about your reader, and why they're reading your book.  They could be reading it to learn the game, or because they find the characters interesting, or because of the story, or ... well, as a writer you get to be more wilfully agnostic about <i>why</i>.<br/><br/>Like, suppose chapters 1 - 4 are about Vicky learning a game, and playing the game (and, also, one presumes doing all sorts of other protagonist stuff like trying to figure out who she is and where she fits in this new group of friends and like that) and then chapters 5 - 8 are about Vicky running the game (and maybe finding love, or learning to assert herself, or whatever).<br/><br/>It strikes me that the author really isn't assuming that anyone who reads chapters 5 - 8 has to be doing so with the intent of running the game.  They could just be reading it because, y'know, they want to find out what happens next.  It's an easier, less hard-sell relationship between author and reader.<br/><br/>It's sort of obvious in retrospect, really:  If you write an instruction manual then the only people who will read it are folks who are hard-core dedicated to learning that skill set.  If you write in a different format then you'll get different (perhaps larger!) readership, and the people who didn't <i>start out</i> with the intention of learning your system will end up learning it anyway, even if they choose never to use it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77111/#Comment_77111" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-22T08:55:34+00:00" title="June 22, 2007  8:55AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Misspent Youth, where there is a clear GM role (The Authority), I have identified all people as players.

I read stories a lot differently than I read rules -- if I'm reading a story about people playing a game, I'm going to pay a lot more attention to the characters and <i>what happens next</i> than I am to the details of the game they're playing.<br/><br/>No matter how hard I try to avoid doing so, I have a horrible habit of skimming when I read fiction -- my eyes just refuse to come to rest on anything that resembles a paragraph of description. I'll usually pick up a few salient details from them, as I'm skipping to the next bit of action or line of dialog, but that's about it. I'm much more able to pay attention to essays and technical writing, which is what most traditional game rules more closely resemble.<br/><br/>And WW style, "read three chapters of overwrought fiction before we get around to presenting a game to you?" Can't <i>stand</i> it. I don't <i>give a crap</i> about your story; I want to learn how your game works so my group can use it to tell stories of our own. If you can engage me in your setting without making me read a bunch of crappy fanfic about it, that's cool. If not, just show me the rules and I'll happily plug them into a setting of my own -- but then, I'm not a big fan of setting-specific games anyway. <i>Genre</i>-specific is a whole 'nother story.<br/><br/>Now, what I <i>would</i> like to see in game texts is <i>examples of play</i>. Not just brief examples of the application of specific rules, but a nice long depiction of <i>people playing the game and having fun</i> that puts the rules I'm about to learn into their proper context. <br/><br/>Although a better place for that would be on the game's website, where it could entice me into buying the game in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77132/#Comment_77132" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-22T11:28:26+00:00" title="June 22, 2007 11:28AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>The real trick is that you have to be able to legitimately use all the rules in a short time.</blockquote>Isn't this a problem of Examples of Play generally?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77181/#Comment_77181" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-22T14:25:14+00:00" title="June 22, 2007  2:25PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It might be valuable to use third person description in paragraph form with breaks for second person indicative. <br/>\n<br/>\nEg.
