It was a no combat awesome fest. The kids, unwilling to join the nekogoblins on their caravan around the world holding carnivals, but also unwilling to let the nekogoblins pout over it, offer to bring them back to their world! First, though, they have to make the Undine water spirit, who's fishy qualities make her a delightful meal for the nekogoblins, and the nekogoblins come together as friends first. That was the biggest roll of the evening, but not the best feelings created. I'm falling in love with "honobono" gaming.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryant" title="Bryant"><img alt="Bryant" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryant">Bryant</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422523/#Comment_422523" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-06T17:49:42+00:00" title="October  6, 2013  5:49PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The awesome thing about Friday night's Golden Sky Stories game at Big Bad Con was lending Kenta my wings because he made my stomach quivery.

They had a conversation with an over-bureaucratic Consortium employee, that asked very formal questions and sighed at every new new fact they brought into the conversation:\n<blockquote>What do you say? Your Captain is sick? This means you'll have to fill the A-15 Green Form for Official Sickness Declaration. Do you think his disease will require a Leave of Absence over 15 days? If so you'll have to add the FFC-55-c form. Oh and you're calling for help? Then I'll have to send an official request to the Operational Services, and if you don't have an answer in the next 48 hours, you'll be able to make this request again.<br/></blockquote>\nMaking this Consortium an overweight bureaucracy was funny, and the players understood this Consortium could not really help them quickly enough and they had to work things out themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422552/#Comment_422552" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-07T11:46:04+00:00" title="October  7, 2013 11:46AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 9, 2013 2:23PM by NickWedig.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Lacuna: Yadda yadda yadda]<br/>My overly cavalier, insufficiently trained mystery agent Sadler spends most of the mission goofing off on a jetpack that he requisitioned.

They've made their way past incompetent car mechanics, suburbanite meth dealers, survivalist spam hoarders, The Cossack, and finally made the delivery and then fought their way through the gang to escape with their lives - during an earthquake.<br/><br/>After back-to-back really good rolls to fight and escape the motorcycle gang, Ruben and his motley collection of hangers-on are rumbling away from an opening faultline in The Machine, when El Nino turns to him.
