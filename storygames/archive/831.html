                    I'm not really one to run around going "these games rawk" and such.  I'm generally not a big booster of SGs, at least, not on the internet.<br/>
<br/>
But I've just gotta gush over what happened at the table tonight.<br/>
<br/>
There's this guy in our group: let's call him Al.  Great guy, we're good friends, he's easy-going but maybe a little on the introverted side.  In fact, we'd known each other for well over 4 years before I ever found out he was into gaming.  And it was his wife who had to tell me...<br/>
<br/>
That's all stage dressing.  The meat of the thing is this: he's always sworn up, down, left and right that he's "not a good roleplayer".<br/>
<br/>
And yet, tonight he was the one grabbing the Town by the horns and messing with my NPCs in our kick-off Dogs game.<br/>
<br/>
Man, if there's one thing that I *love* about SGs is that they've taught me &amp; mine that "good roleplaying" does not equal "sounding as cool and slick as Deniro".<br/>
<br/>
'cuz you know what?  <br/>
<br/>
Deniro gets multiple takes.                </div>

                            Let's put it this way:<br/><br/>Typically, Al is the sort of player who will hang back from a conflict unless you actually confront him directly ("the sniper shoots at YOU").  And even then, his reactions are typically defensive in nature.  I always (internally) bemoan the fact that no matter what I do, I'm just spurring him to <i>inaction</i>.<br/><br/>That's what was different last night --<br/><br/>1) introductory confict.  It flowed right off of my question -- it was like this:<br/><br/><b>me:</b> So, what do you hope to gain from training?  What that means is th--<br/><b>al:</b> Uphold my family's reputation.<br/><i><b>me</b> sits slack-jawed, flabbergasted over not getting to drag stakes out of Al.</i><br/><br/>2) game proper.<br/><br/>So, the dogs ride into town.  I'm all busy throwing stuff at them -- how the town wasn't expecting them (shouldn't the town know that they're coming?), there's a crew working on a washed out road, everyone in town is all immaculately dressed, blah blah blah.<br/><br/>The players are all soaking it in, asking probing questions, but mostly just setting stuff, like "is there a general store" sort of stuff.  But every one's paying attention.<br/><br/>Then, the community gathers to greet the dogs, sort of in a disorganized fashion.  The Steward starts to say "hi" and there's this obvious rift in the crowd -- there's an entire clique of people who look nonplussed that the steward is speaking for them.<br/><br/>I'm all busy getting ready to go on with GM narration when...<br/><br/><b>al:</b> Who's the ringleader?<br/><b>me:</b> <i>pause, disbelieving</i> Um, this one tall lady in the middle of this gaggle of chattering old biddies.<br/><b>al:</b> <i>to tall lady</i> Why do you question the Steward's right to speak for you?<br/><br/>And you can guess where it went from there.  It was a no-holds-barred awesomefest.<br/><br/>I just can't stress enough how <i>cool</i> it is that the system rewards the players for giving a flying *#$% about the game.  It's all about getting your mitts into it, in whatever way is comfortable for you the player.<br/><br/>First person "dialogue" style narration?  Sure, we can do that.<br/>3rd person "my guy does..."?  Yup.<br/>Group kibbitzing?  Hell, yeah.<br/>any number of other possible ways of introducing stuff into the SIS?  un-hunh.<br/><br/>Choose your flavour, boyz...hell, choose 'em all.<br/><br/>Coolness.                        </div>
