                    So, after overloading my geek batteries (in the good way) at GenCon, an idea has grabbed a hold of me and refuses to let go.  It's bad enough that my momentum on the novel I'm writing has been flagging.<br/>
<br/>
The basic setup is this:   "Capes in the Wasteland" (Post-Apocalyptic America in a world that had a fairly familiar history of supers.  A vast conspiracy of villains simultaenously execute their plans, destroying the infrastructure of society.  Cities crumble, armies torn apart, and the counrty is left in shambles.  10-ish years later, traveling groups of heroes old and new help inspire the survivors to re-build their communities, fighting old villains, new tyrants, and above all, despair.  In a world that has relied on heroes to solve their big problems for sixty years, some people need to be inspired, to be lead, before they can get back on their feet.  The player-characters are these supers, helping push and pull people up a ladder of virtue.<br/>
<br/>
The idea came about due doing the following things in close succession:  Reading Capes, playing in a post-apocalyptic Buffy/Angelverse LARP, and getting excited about Dogs in the Vineyard and The Princes' Kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
I've got a thread about it on the Forge in the lumpley games forum, as a DitV Hack, but I'm pondering striking farther out and doing this as its own game.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the thread:  <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21115.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21115.0</a><br/>
<br/>
Does this sound like something workable?  How far does it have to go from the DitV mold to become its own thing and not just a homebrew mod?  Can a supers world go post-apocalyptic and retain the compelling aspects of superheroes?  Can you get excited about this concept?  What would you want to see covered, mechanics/setting-wise?                </div>

I think it sounds totally workable and I'm surprised no comic has done it. (Perhaps it has, for all I know.) It's a little bit genre-breaking, because part of the genre convention is that the supers always avert the apocalypse, but genre-breaking is good.<br><br>I don't, myself, like post-apocalyptic (just a personal preference so ignore that), but I like the idea of examining the ideas of leadership and lack of initiative, of the supers helping the non-supers to become more independent. Right there, you're departing from DitV far enough to make a "new game": rather than returning a town to the one, true way, you are helping it to mature to the point that it can help itself. You (or someone else) could potentially re-set it in the Third World.<br><br>I think your biggest challenge will be finding a mechanic that reinforces this. I suspect that "ladder of virtue" is a key phrase which you should contemplate further when seeking this mechanic. Also, if it were me I'd read about strategies being used by real-life development agencies to help Third-World people attain this kind of independence.<br><br>Something else that could potentially be new here: The PCs working to "power up" the NPCs rather than using them as a source of powerups.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            One bargain-bin source you can look to for inspiration is Pinnacle Entertainment Group's <b>Brave New World</b>, in which supervillians create an Orwellian America.                        </div>

                            This sounds superb. It reminds me very, very much of Batman: No Man's Land.<br><br>As far as being different from DitV goes: I'd suggest you don't worry about it too much. IMO, as long as you're just taking the mechanics of DitV and giving things different names, then it's a DitV mod; once you've started to tweak the mechanics to reflect your setting, it becomes less like a mod and more like its own game (albeit a child game of DitV). Both of those options sound fun to play.<br><br/>Oh, to answer your other specific questions: it sounds very workable; yes, I'd love to see a post-apocalyptic superhero thing (No Man's Land was quite close to that); yes, I'm very excited about it; and it's too early in the morning to think about specific mechanics, but I'll get back to you.<br/><br/>Graham                        </br></br></br></div>

                            I'll reiterate here what I put on the Forge yesterday, at the time I tried the first post here the topic kept booting me to Forge so I made an identity there...<br/>
<br/>
I have personally seen many variations on this particular theme in the past 25 years.  An old Polyhedron Magazine had an article about Gamma World Cryptic Alliances including the "Friends of Justice" that inspired a whole post-apocalyptic superhero campaign in Gamma World. I've played in games using TSR's old Marvel Super Heroes system that took place in  The Irradiated Territories  and more recently in a Champions game along these lines.  Were you approaching this as an idea independent of any system, the theme for each PC should be a "Virtue" or a "core set of Virtues" that they work toward.  They would also have an Inspiration or Instill metric that helps give hope to the masses.  These are far more important than powers that they wield in a given system because of sociological reactions to this sort of trauma.<br/>
<br/>
A portion of the people they will want to save will be resentful, perhaps transfering the tragedy to the very existence of powered beings.  Another portion will be subservient or perhaps worshipful of the powered beings.  The latter could tempt heroes into setting up their own petty dictatorships or taking advantage of the locals, the former could frustrate and anger them with the very people they wish to lift up.  PCs will have to remember who the real enemies are and be true to the ideals they represent: "The Virtue".<br/>
<br/>
How do these heroes react to survivors conducting witch hunts for those born with a gift?  How do they react to being worshipped as gods?  These things will test them more than any combat against a super villain.  What if someone who had been the skilled equivalent of a superhero, a former ally, is now leading hunting parties of normals to topple both his old foes and his old friends?  A former villain trying to restore order to an area, is it just an attempt at dominating the people, or is it out of genuine concern?  What will the heroes assume?  As was indicated in another post when you take away the accepted socio-political systems in a tragic incident, you see what people truly are made of.<br/>
<br/>
So out of a system context:<br/>
<br/>
Virtue:  The beliefs of the hero. The most important thing for the PC.<br/>
Instill/Inspire:  A conduit to represent how much of an impact the heroes deeds have on other survivors.  A possible way for his/her "virtue" to be given to another, to overcome their fears, misconceptions, desperation, etc.  The villains would use Intill/Inspire to use fear to squash hope in the survivors.<br/>
Hope:  The ability to see the greatest good possible in potentially dire circumstances.<br/>
Desire: Something to be potentially exploited or twisted, a challenge for the hero.<br/>
Need:  Could gauge a minimum requirement for the hero, the villain, and the average survivor to keep them going physically, mentally, or both.<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts.                        </div>
