Write as if it's 2014 and things have changed by some amount.</i><br/><br/>So, 2013 came to a close, and the folks who did 2013 Gaming Goals had a little introspective on what they achieved and what surprised them about their year in gaming. And now we're a couple months into 2014, and I feel like it's an interesting time to ask:<br/><br/><b>What are you playing these days?</b> Tell me a bit about the social space you play in, the way the games are shaping up, all those juicy details. As much as possible, leave the "insider jargon" out of this conversation. Write it so that someone who's been out of the story games loop for a couple years would still be able to follow along.<br/><br/>On my end, I've been introducing people to <b>Between Dead Oaks</b>, the new <i>hard sitch</i> game by Vincent Baker and Wendy Emerson. It's got some of the same tone as Murderous Ghosts (the first <i>hard sitch</i> game, though predating the phrase), but builds on the mechanical ideas of <b>Untenable</b>. These games are becoming one of my favourite gaming experiences, because I can rock a rewarding game session while sitting in a coffee shop with a cutie. Ideal.<br/><br/>On the more involved end, I've been playing <b>Cloud Cycle</b>, which has got to be the weirdest play experience I've encountered in a while. I'm constantly surprised that the asynchronous digital parts and the sit-down table sessions interact as well and as consistently as they do. I keep on expecting the game to collapse, and it keeps on delivering engrossing fiction. For anyone who spent last year under a rock, know: you play scientists who've discovered heaven, and who're engaged in an ongoing research mission to learn about angels and the afterlife. Luke Crane and Elizabeth Shoemaker really hit it out of the park, wrt both slick design and pioneering new platform frontiers. Before playing, I thought the global digital exploration part of the game was going to be a boring faux-social-media experiment, yet another Facebook or Nametag to have to keep up with. It's not. It's linked into the table sessions in really emergent and surprising ways.<br/><br/>Thoughts? I know there are a million interesting things going on right now for our community, and I want to hear which ones you've been playing around with!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362133/#Comment_362133" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T22:40:55+00:00" title="February 23, 2012 10:40PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the <b>Dungeoncore X</b> kickstarter was a success!

Players are put in the role of scientists desperately trying to prepare for the worst in the face of a society that doesn't believe them. The tragic irony is very poignant.

I think this one is going to be inspired by "Avengers Forever," so it's going to be Marvel heroes from a bunch of different published event books, all thrown together in an attempt to stop the 2099 universe from coming to pass (i.e. the world being taken over by evil megacorps). Super psyched for that one.  I'm running the game but we're gonna try some rotating stuff too, based on the principles in Jackson Tegu's <i>On the Doorstep</i>, and I think my active character is going to be Victor Von Doom.<br/><br/>The recent cross-pollination between the indie and OSR scenes has produced so much cool stuff, most of it vaguely compatible, and I've also been running an old school Basic-inspired game for people from work, drawing on a mixture of recent old school adventures by Eero Tuovinen, Jason Morningstar, Luke Crane, and John Harper.  It's fascinating how -- just as <i>Dungeon World</i> blew up, mostly outside the indie games community -- a lot of established indie designers seemed to shift away from <i>Burning Wheel</i> or <i>Apocalypse World</i>-inspired sandbox play and more towards old school down-in-a-hole, mapping and calling play.  Even the new LLAMA FLAMES games, <i>Do You Get Torn to Pieces by Killer Sharks</i> and <i>Oh My God the Volcano is Erupting</i> have shifted AW principles in a more old-school direction, including mapping instructions and carefully tracking the gear that you have. While <i>Storming the Wizard's Tower</i> provided some clues on how this might work, it wasn't until I played <i>Sharks</i> -- fending off some hungry fish with a tattered umbrella and trying to figure out how quickly the waves were pushing me towards land -- that it clicked for me; it's changed the way I run both <i>Tower</i> and <i>Apocalypse World</i> now.<br/><br/>Other than that, I've been mostly playing a bunch of small, experimental stuff.  I kinda want to play <i>Bliss Stage</i> again, now that the final version is out, but there's so much other fun stuff that I'm not sure when I'll get around to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362405/#Comment_362405" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T12:13:41+00:00" title="February 24, 2012 12:13PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Burning Wheel Gold sits on my shelf gathering dust next to the Burning Wheel Gold Companion (a compilation of updated versions of the Monster Burner, Magic Burner and Adventure Burner).
