Learn rules as they go. Want to be handed a character, not make one. So I'm deliberate about what to teach and when. <br/><br/>Some want to learn to play from the book, step by step. Especially if they plan to run the game themselves. And want to make their own characters.<br/><br/>Character creation often starts with "Character Concept". Essentially, "imagine the kind of character you want to play."<br/><br/>Some have no idea. Imagine anything sometimes leads to nothing and they hit a wall. But others form very specific ideas. <br/><br/>The people who "imagined the kind of character they want to play" are quickly annoyed when the numbers part of character creation begins and limitation after limitation distorts or contradicts what they imagined (depending how tightly structured the game is, with Dogs in the Vineyard, this isn't an issue but with many popular games it is). <br/><br/>The discomfort is often temporary. Not a game killer (although I remember plenty of people in high school walking away from RPGs trying to make their wizard like Gandalf). But it seems unnecessary in games with hard limits. <br/><br/>I like limits! Often when I skip the "character concept" part, a character concept emerges from those limitations and everything flows smoothly. The limits helps us bring our ideas together. The limits often inform and inject the setting into our characters. And generally makes the game cohesive. <br/><br/>What I take away from this is when I'm teaching games with hard limits, I'm going to skip the character concept part. If I want to inspire, I can point to the game's art or have them look through a few pregenerated characters before making their own. But starting with "imagine anything" has been problematic. <br/><br/>What's your experience?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Queex" title="Queex"><img alt="Queex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Queex">Queex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261161/#Comment_261161" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T08:40:40+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  8:40AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a lot depends on the game in question.<br/><br/>Despite its Tolkienesque roots, D&amp;D doesn't really have a lot in common with its precursor material in terms of tone, stories or character actions and motivation. That disconnect becomes apparent in character creation, when you see that all of the cool stuff is for characters that are a higher level than you, and many of the things you would expect to be included in a true Middle Earth game aren't there.<br/><br/>Games that have limits that are very much in accordance with what the game appears to concentrate on (MLWM being a prime example) don't risk putting potential players off because the lines they have to draw their character within are advertised up front. The limit in this case is that you're a minion- your goal is to get the self-confidence you need to defy the Master. The character creation then flows smoothly from that.<br/><br/>Basically, I think the problem lies when the game implies a broader range of possible characters than the rules actually permit, particularly at chargen. If a game says 'you can be any kind of X you want', it had better be able to back it up for any potential X. Feng Shui tells you that you can make a version of any action film trope character- and you can, by golly.<br/><br/>So yeah- I agree. But I think there are two distinct things here- the natural brainfart you get when anyone says 'think of anything you want', and games not following through on what their concept advertises.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261164/#Comment_261164" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T08:44:31+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  8:44AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the design pattern of creating a character by following his/her life story in chronological order \u2014 a la Burning Wheel, and FATE, and probably others. It lets you start with a basic idea and refine it in a fairly organic way. Then if necessary you can get fiddly and retcon the back-story to get exactly the features you want.<br/><br/>Spirit Of The Century has an optional quick system where you define only part of the character's stats before play, and can fill in the rest on the fly when you need them. I haven't tried that, but it seems like a good choice for newbies who may get worried about choosing between different abilities that they can't really evaluate yet because they haven't experienced the gameplay.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261179/#Comment_261179" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T09:20:12+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  9:20AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great post, John.<br/><br/>There was a little experiment Ron ran over at the Forge a while back, where he linked to a picture of a character, and then had various people 'stat up' that character in a system of their choice. <br/><br/>It was really revealing to see how much the system chosen affected the final character. Sure, each person had a personal interpretation of who the character in the picture was, but the impact of the system chosen on that character was still very, very apparent. For instance, creating the character under the Sorcerer rules meant that she had to have a bound demon, whereas creating the same character in My Life with Master would mean she was subservient to a Master in a dysfunctional relationship. Those paint very different images of the character, even ignoring all the other mechanical differences.<br/><br/>I, too, have seen more than my fair share of people frustrated after trying to play Gandalf in (any version of) D&amp;D, especially as a first-level character.<br/><br/>Dogs is a particularly interesting example for beginners, because it`s a game you can play very successfully without having any character concept in mind at all, as opposed to something like, say, Primetime Adventures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261269/#Comment_261269" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T12:02:14+00:00" title="March 10, 2010 12:02PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am with you, John.

The point of play and the setting and the rough idea of "what characters do" always inspires me with <i>some</i> sort of character concept.  If the game is hardwired with specific situations, my concept will be more specific; in open-ended games, my concept will be vague, only being refined during the steps of char-gen.  <br/><br/>At whatever point I begin to form an attachment to a character idea, I'll announce that to the group.  Hopefully I'll then get a sense of if my idea is compatible with the group's aesthetics and the game-facilitator's understanding of the rules.  If my idea is shot down, well, I haven't committed much to it yet, so I can scrap it and start over.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261324/#Comment_261324" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T13:57:16+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  1:57PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, my workflow for character creation tends to start from the game system and move towards the character concept, too.  I look at what kinds of things I feel like doing in a game this time around (as a player, mind you: questions like "Do I want to talk a lot, or do I want to do a lot of action, or do I want to build things?").  Then I look at the system to see which (if any) of those things look like they'd be fun to do in this particular system.  Then I think about how to build a character who is good at those things within those rules, and let that process steer me towards an actual character concept.<br/><br/>Wait, actually, there's an intermediate step I slot in between "what would be fun in this system" and "how to build a character to do that": the part where I figure out whether this character would fit into the particular campaign we're going to be playing.  I've gotten burned before by getting psyched up about a character who just didn't belong there, so now I do whatever I can to make sure that when we actually sit down at the table to play, I won't be left sitting on the sidelines wondering why I even bothered to show up.<br/><br/>And I think this kind of learning-from-failure is what drove me to start character creation by looking at the game system first, since I got tired of falling in love with a character concept that simply could not be pulled off within the rules.  (It also works well with our group's predilection for trying out lots of different systems.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JAR" title="JAR"><img alt="JAR" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JAR">JAR</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261345/#Comment_261345" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T15:50:10+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  3:50PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Concrete example of what I think Accounting is talking about, but even worse:<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying in a game that's meant to be old WoD Mage in nWoD rules-clothes, right? So I'm re-reading the old Mage setting and I glom on to the Solficati. "Cool," I think, "alchemy is interesting.

I'm gonna be an alchemist!"<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then the way the point buy in this particular game ends up working out, despite the fact that we're playing experienced characters, I cannot possibly have sufficient spheres to make potions/tinctures/unguents that have any effect independent of my being there at that very moment in time.

Or, if they don't, there's no way of knowing whether what they come up will connect well to what your game is about or what it asks them to do later.  If you rely on people just doing whatever they feel like they may 1) quit, 2) feel frustrated, or 3) have the game explode in their faces because they made what they thought were reasonable choices that turned out to be totally wrong for the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261365/#Comment_261365" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T17:31:08+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  5:31PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan,<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm gonna take a stab at your statement and modify it to what I think you mean.

So is saying "Come up with the setting that you want to play in."</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nI disagree that it's bad design. Concept first character creation works well for a lot of people and a lot of games. As a rule, I have a hard time really enjoying a character unless I have a concept first. Admittedly, I've had my own share of Concept Doesn't Fit the Game blues, but these are the exception rather than the rule. It is, however, a bad way to instruct someone to come up with a character to simply say that, and then move into "and then, start statting your character up." It's the same sort of thing that I've personally observed, and have read discussions on regarding design challenges; Given constraints, your creativity is better able to flow than if you're given a blank slate and told "begin!".<br/>\n<br/>\nGive guidelines for the sort of characters that work. Give example characters, complete with stats. Give fiction snippets (yeah, yeah, I know some hate micro-fic; Deal with it!) that illustrate the sort of characters and the situations they get into in a typical session of the game. Give pre-gens for those that absolutely must play before they can possibly design a character.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, give guidelines for those who simply want to start the mechanical process and let the character emerge. This is one of the hardest lessons I learned. I used to try to force players to get a concept and choose Spiritual Attributes in The Riddle of Steel before we got to the mechanical bits. Sometimes it worked beautifully. Often, I met with obstinate refusal to do it that way, or the resulting characters were lackluster, even to the players who made them. Some people simply cannot do concept-first character design. Others cannot do it any other way. It's obvious which way I lean, and frankly, those that can't do it are like people who are into BDSM; I cannot fathom <i>why</i> they're like that, but I have come to accept that these people do exist.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261500/#Comment_261500" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-11T15:27:26+00:00" title="March 11, 2010  3:27PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the challenge in design (or presentation, if you're running a game, and the designer hasn't done this for you) is to make sure that whatever characters are created are suitable to the game you're about to play.
