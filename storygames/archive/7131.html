Even with a converter, I've found that US CD players don't run at quite the same speed, and I'm not sure what that would do to a more complicated system like a video game console.<br/><br/>For 360<br/><br/>1. Some times. Whether or not a game is region locked is left up to the publisher. <a href="http://gaming.wikia.com/wiki/Region_Free_Xbox_360_Games" rel="nofollow">Here's a list</a> of region free 360 games. The prices your brother will find at the big box stores (Target, Best Buy, Walmart, etc.) are similar. You might check a Sunday paper for any sales, but otherwise, it really doesn't matter.<br/>2. Depends. Are you interested in downloading a lot of games from Xbox Live? Game save files won't take up a lot of space, but downloadable games have been growing in size over the course of this generation.<br/>3. Get as many controllers as you think you'll need, and get rechargeable battery packs, because having to swap in new double-As is annoying.<br/><br/>For PS3<br/><br/>1. Some times. Sony-made games for PS3 are region-free. For third-party publishers, it can go either way. Virtually all Blu-ray movie discs are region locked, though, so you can't watch Region 2 movies on a Region 1 player like a US PS3.<br/>2. Depends. Are you interested in downloading content from PSN? Save games won't take up a lot of space, but downloaded games will. The prices your brother will find at the big box stores (Target, Best Buy, Walmart, etc.) are similar. You might check a Sunday paper for any sales, but otherwise, it really doesn't matter.<br/>3. The dual-shock controller (the one with vibration) is a good buy. Buy up to 4 depending on how many people you intend to regularly bring over to play. Not only is the tactile sensation of vibration nice, but the controllers are slightly heavier, and, in my opinion, feel better in my hands.<br/><br/>Bonus PS3 question<br/>1. The 40 GB PS3 is not backwards compatible. Versions of the console with more memory also contain PS2 hardware emulation, which allows them to play PS2 games. There will be subtle differences in visuals, but nothing that should affect gameplay. If you are worried about specific games, Google the title and "ps3 emulation" or something similar and you should see any reports of problems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_158578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister" title="ihmcallister"><img alt="ihmcallister" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister">ihmcallister</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158578/#Comment_158578" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-25T10:46:47+00:00" title="July 25, 2008 10:46AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will try and give some answers:<br/><br/>1) No, there is region encoding on games, no codebreak for it that I know of. That applies to both consoles. Some blu-ray films are regionalised some aren't it seem a bit unclear at the moment.<br/><br/>2) There is a new 60gb PS3 just been announced which should hit in august in Europe, not sure of release stateside. The basic advice would be the biggest you can afford though the 20gb tends to be the most common. 360 wise you should buy the elite as it comes with a bigger hard drive and the internal components are slightly different meaning there is less chance of red ring of death.<br/><br/>3) You will not need extra memory for either but you may want a card to transport game info about. Most of the next gen consoles are funny about you moving info. from one console to another because they all update via the internet and a lot of games have online rankings and achievements. They basically don't want people cheating.<br/><br/>Extra controllers are a must I would say. For playstation 3 make sure you get the dualshock 3 and not the sixaxis which is a lightweight piece of crap. The xbox 360 does not come with wireless connection, on any model, so you may want to consider getting a wireless bridge for it. Costs about \xa360 over here.<br/><br/>DVD remote for playstation 3 if you want to play blu-ray.<br/><br/>As for your playstation 3 question you are plain out of luck. There is no backwards compatibility for the current playstation 3 consoles. The orginial one that released, 80gb?, had some but it was patchy at best. Sony are not interested in providing you with that function, and that does not look like it will change anytime soon.<br/><br/>Hope that helps<br/><br/>Iain                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158582/#Comment_158582" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-25T10:54:05+00:00" title="July 25, 2008 10:54AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My semi-informed opinion:<br/><br/>Console Questions:<br/><br/>1. The PS3's games are not region-specific.  However, you may run into video issues.  I believe that NA is on the NTSC standard while Europe is PAL, correct?  I don't believe this would be true for HD - (SD: 480i versus 576i, HD:720).  I think all PS3 titles would support 720p, so if you have an HD set you should be, uhm...set. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>The Xbox 360 is region-encoded/locked, so I don't think games purchased in Europe would work.<br/><br/><br/>2. The answer to this question depends on what you're using the machine for.  If you're simply playing games that you buy on-disc - i.e. no video streaming/playing, no demos downloaded, no PSN or Xbox Live games, than get that cheapest one that comes with any sort of HD.  With the Xbox 360, the Elite used to matter with regards to HDMI output, but the newest "basic" versions have HDMI-out.  <br/><br/>If you plan on getting demos, or downloadable content, then the hard-drive size matters.  How much depends on you.  I know there's hacky ways of getting an external hard drive hooked up to these boxes, and it's a much cheaper alternative.<br/><br/>If you're planning on playing PS2 games on your PS3, and you want best backwards compatibility, then the version you choose very much matters (see below).<br/><br/><br/>3. Depends.  Memory is hard-drive space above, with the caveats listed.  Extra controllers depends on how much you play multiplayer games.  There's other options (wireless 'net adapter, wireless controllers), each of which comes down to "how much does this matter to you?"<br/><br/><br/>PS3 specific:<br/><br/>1. This gets ugly.<br/><br/>Check out the "Retail Configurations" chart here:<br/><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3</a><br/><br/>If PS2 compatibility *really* matters to you, you'll need one of the models that lists "Hardware" under "PS2 compatibility" - the 20GB NTSC, or the 60GB NTSC.  These might be hard to find in stores.  These boxes have the literal hardware from a PS2 in them.<br/><br/>The others either have none (the 40/80 PALs) or software emulation (60GB PAL, 80GB NTSC).  I've heard mixed reviews on the software emulation support.  Some games simply don't work or look incredibly ugly.  The good news is that this *might* be improved in future firmware releases.<br/><br/><br/>Hope this helps!<br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_158587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158587/#Comment_158587" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-25T11:07:26+00:00" title="July 25, 2008 11:07AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 25, 2008 11:13AM by Jogesh EZ.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Crossposted with IM and peccable.<br/><br/>1. No.  You need an EU region console. This is true of all consoles. You can't even hope for a hack, really, because North American boxes are set to run with NTSC TVs, not PAL. Presuming you speak English and live in an English speaking country, and only plan to buy English games, then language settings on the console isn't a concern, although that's another possible area of problems (I know this is the case for the <b>Console that Shall Not Be Named</b> - but I haven't worked on XBox or PS3 games, so I don't know).  However, if you have an NTSC TV, North American to Eurpean power adapters, you can get by. Are games also double the price there? If so, it might even be worth it! You'd have to import all your games, but it's not like it senses where you are.  You also might only be able to play online with people in North America, which could have you off peak hours, as not able to find games without a good amount of lag, though.<br/><br/>HD TVs also have different formats in Europe than North America.  Well, at least the settings are different for the <b>Console that Shall Not Be Named</b>.<br/><br/>2. Up to you. They are selling off the 20 GB hard drive model for $299 for the X-Box, but the 60 GB for $349 is a better deal. Not sure what the PS3 prices are going for right now, and the different models are a bit confusing, since they have something like 4 different types.  But at Launch, they had two, I think the 20 GB model and the 40 GB model.  You DO NOT want the 20 GB model. You want the high end one. It will probably be about $100 more (I think they are about $400 or $450 now for the 40), but the difference is far more than hard drive size: external connections, memory and other hardware concerns that are not upgradeable and might cause problems with certain games are castrated in the 20 GB model. Since the 20 GB model is being phased out (I think, if it hasn't already been) you might not have to worry.<br/><br/>3. 2-4 controllers depending on how many people you tend to have over to play video games. For X-Box, X-Box Live Gold membership is near mandatory if you are interested in the online capabilities. This is about $70 a year.  Since HD movies are dead, there's no need to buy the HD DVD player for XBox.  Oh, you might need a memory card for the XBox. Since Microsoft was a bunch of morons and did not make the harddrive a mandatory component (there's a cheaper model I didn't mention without one - avoid it) then not all games support hard drives. You might need a memory card to save your game in some cases.<br/><br/>PS3 only:<br/>1. PS2 games work just fine.  Some of them will get a slight bump in texture quality or anti-aliasing or have less slowdown. But there's not a big change.  Apparently a small number of games don't work, but it's not enough of them to worry about.  You can find lists online that have specific games that don't work.  Since the PS3 upgrades the firmware a lot, these might be solveable in some cases.  Of course, if you have European PS2 games, they won't work on a North American PS3.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158589/#Comment_158589" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-25T11:11:13+00:00" title="July 25, 2008 11:11AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben<br/>What, the 360 controllers uses batteries?

Yes, very bad. 1/3 brick rate at one time.  However, they have it mostly solved and much improved.  Here's where dates on the box becomes important. I believe the boxes since April 2008 are good.  There's a lot of UPC code checking, and I'm not sure of the specifics. But if your brother is going 360 shopping, he's going to want to be armed with this information to ensure he's not buying an older system. Having a North American box at a European address might be a warranty violation (but that's just pure guessing, it's probably okay).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_158595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158595/#Comment_158595" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-25T11:20:51+00:00" title="July 25, 2008 11:20AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What is the Red Ring of Death?<br/><br/>Also, we don't even live in Europe.<br/>Bill Gates on his last visit here this year said he will do something about bringing X-Box 360 to us, right now it's all private vendors who bring it, so no technical support!<br/><br/>One of my brother's best friends has an X-360, I think I'll send some questions to him too, since it seems my brother is more into the X-360 (while I like the JRPGs the PS(2) is master of).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158596/#Comment_158596" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-25T11:24:23+00:00" title="July 25, 2008 11:24AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>What is the Red Ring of Death?</blockquote>\nIt's when three red lights come on on your X-Box 360, meaning it's broken and needs to be sent back to...well...someone to repair.

Sometimes (sometimes) you just need to power your console down and start it up again. Other times, it means that your box is bricked, and you need to send it to Microsoft for repairs/replacement.<br/><br/>When the 360 first launched, there were significant numbers of these that happened for seemingly no reason. Over time, with various updates and hardware revisions, they're significantly less frequent. A new 360 purchased these days is going to be fine. I can think of 2 main causes of the red ring outside of obvious things like spilling liquids all over your machine or kicking it down the stairs, etc.<br/><br/>1) A power surge has a chance of bricking a 360. I've seen brownouts brick 1/3 of the 360 dev kits in a developer studio.<br/>2) Old age.

I live in the UK and have a UK 360 (first UK console I've owned in years...), and it seems about half the games which come out in the US are region locked and half aren't.  Electronic Arts lock all their games, for example.  The 360 also plays SOME original XBox games, but the list is quite small and all XBox games were region locked, so you'd only be able to play US XBox games on a US 360.<br/><br/>All PS3 games are region free.  That's it.  You can play any PS3 game on any PS3.  I have a Hong Kong PS3 and it plays UK games perfectly.  I've also set it up to buy from the UK online shop and to display all in English etc etc.  But just because the PS3 games all work and are region free, that's not the end of the story.  If you get one of the premium (in the US that's 80Gb) consoles, it'll play PS2 games (and PS1 games IIRC) but is region locked.  So you'll only get to play US region PS2/1 games on a US PS3.  The 80Gb console has software emulation, the 60Gb console had PS2 hardware inside,2 but is no longer available.  By all accounts, there's not really much in it in terms of play experience.  You will need a PS2 memory card and an adaptor in order to save PS2 games on a PS3 though.  In there wisdom, Sony decided that you wouldn't want to save PS2 data onto the internal hard drive.  I honestly think it'd be cheaper to buy a PS2 that get all the upgrades to the PS3 to play PS2 games.<br/><br/>The other thing about the PS3 is BluRay.  BluRay is region locked much the same as DVD.  The US and Far East is region A, Europe is region B, Asia and the Middle East is region C.  So if you buy a US PS3, you're only able to play region A BluRay disks.  A lot of disk for sale here in the UK Are multiregion (ABC), but US ones tend not to be.  I don't really care about the multiregion UK disks, because they're still 150% or more of the price of importing the same title from the US, and since HK is region A, all US disks work on my PS3.  Of course, if you don't have an HDTV, you probably don't care about BluRay right now.<br/><br/>Both consoles also play DVDs, but are very much region locked.  So a US PS3 are 360 will only play region 1 DVDs.<br/><br/>Both use wireless controllers.  The 360 uses 2 AA batteries, the PS3 has it's own rechargeable, non-replaceable battery.  The PS3 controller charges from a mini USB port on the top, but only if the PS3 is switched on.  This is (IMHO) a ridiculous design flaw, but someone obviously thought it was a good idea.  I mean, if I've got the thing on, I need to be using the controller, right?  But I can't, because I have to have in plugged in to charge if the battery is flat...  I'd say that for this reason a second controller is essential if you buy a PS3, so that one can charge while the other is in use.<br/><br/>Voltage wise, you can plug a PS3 in anywhere in the world as long as you have the right cable.  It's a standard 3 pin D shaped connector like you use to plug in most computers on monitors.  The internal PSU can run on anything from 110v - 240v.  I've got my HK PS3 plugged straight into the wall here, and it's fine.<br/><br/>If you get a 360, you'll need a hard drive to make use of the online features.  New 360s will start coming with 60Gb drives as standard soon, if you're going to get one, wait for that.  If you don't get one with it, get one.<br/><br/>Headsets are pretty much essential for online play.  The 360 uses semi-special ones and the decent pack come with a wired one included.  The PS3 doesn't come with one, but you can use any* bluetooth headset with it.<br/><br/>The 360 Elite has a 120 Gb hard drive and HDMI port on the back.  Also, it's black instead of crap grey.  Thing is though, that 120Gb is nice and all, but even the cheap 360 bundles now come with HDMI ports on them.  So really, I don't see the point since the new "standard" drive is going to be 60 Gb.  Unless you really really want one in black.<br/><br/>360s are notoriously unreliable.  This is the only reason I was willing to pay the extra and get the UK model this time around, to get the 3 year warranty.  I'd suggest that importing one might be ill advised.  I don't know anyone with a 360 who actually uses it regularly and has had their more that a year without it breaking.  I know a guy who's still using his launch console, but he only uses it once a month if that and considers 2 hours gaming a marathon session.<br/><br/>Wireless: the 360 doesn't come with built in wireless, you need to get an add on or connect it wired.  Some PS3s come with wireless, one which don't can't be upgraded, but you could always run it wired off a wireless bridge.<br/><br/>I hope that helps.<br/><br/>* "Any", as in some don't work, but they don't need to be special PS3 ones,                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_158752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158752/#Comment_158752" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-26T07:12:45+00:00" title="July 26, 2008  7:12AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rich Stokes</cite>You will need a PS2 memory card and an adaptor in order to save PS2 games on a PS3 though.

If you buy a region one box it'll only play region one games, or any number of third-party region-free titles.  None of the systems are HD-players.  That was a separate attachment built for the system that is no longer available.  You shouldn't have much of any problems with the playback on your television, as has been previously stated, though the voltage could be an issue.  What country do you live in, and what's the standard voltage there?<br/><br/>The PS3 has no region lock to it.  You'll be able to play any game from any region with no problem.  Voltage will still be an issue, so you should research that for sure.  Same as above, playback shouldn't be hampered by your television as long as it has appropriate international playback support.  <br/><br/>As for which version of the box you should get... this is the part where we encounter the <i>fun</i>.  <br/><br/>The 360 is pretty straight up.  Wait until September and buy the new 60 gig model that's replacing the current "Pro" level box.  I'm not joking here.  It includes the newer 64-nanometer chipset (more on that later) and comes with the larger hard drive.  This is being rolled out for the new 360 firmware set up that will include tons of new functionality, so I'd say that if you can afford it, wait and buy the new model that's coming out.  Failing that, go for the 20-gig Pro that's out now.  The only difference between the Pro and the Elite is that the Elite box comes with HDMI cables packed in.  <br/><br/>The PS3 is a fucking land mine.  I'll tell you what I tell my customers; if you can find a 60-gig, hop on it like it's a life preserver.  The 60 has the best, most reliable backwards compatibility and if that's a concern for you, then that's the only way to go.  If you're not interested in BC at all then the 40 and the (upcoming) 80 are the same damned thing, just with differing hard drive sizes.  And in three months there won't even be a 40 on the market, so it's a bit of a non-issue there.  The currently-available limited edition 80-gig is nice.  It's a backwards compatible 80 (which I'll detail further down the post) and it's got Metal Gear Solid 4 packed in, as well as the DualShock3 controller rather than the original (re: crap) Six-Axis controller.  If you want MGS4, then that's the box for you.  The availability is limited so it might be hard to get your hands on it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MPOSullivan" title="MPOSullivan"><img alt="MPOSullivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/581/nMZWSVRTOY7XL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MPOSullivan">MPOSullivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158775/#Comment_158775" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-26T11:48:26+00:00" title="July 26, 2008 11:48AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alright, let's now move on to the questions that came out of the answers.  <br/><br/><b>The Red Ring of Death</b><br/>Is not actually a ring, because it only fills three of the four status lights that wrap around the power button of the 360.  What that signals is a serious hardware malfunction.  Normally, the RRoD is a result of a design flaw that was made in the layout and construction of the motherboard.  The processor chip was located on the motherboard in an unusual place to accommodate all of the wild shit they packed into the box, and had a cooling fan plugged on top of it.  The problem with this is that the brackets used to fasten that cooling fan on were a bit "odd".  Here, "odd" reads as "stupid".  <br/><br/>Imagine that the cooling fan is sitting right atop the chip, just like it would with most computers.  Now, imagine that the fastener rods that hold said fan in place reach through the motherboard itself and latch in on the other side of the motherboard and chip.  They latch together, forming an "X" shape across the back of the chip.  <br/><br/>The problem with this configuration comes up when the system runs hot.  And the 360 often runs hot.  You know, like any fucking electronic equipment will tend to do.  The motherboard bows a little, just like any other motherboard would do.  Just a fraction of a centimeter.  But that's enough.  The cross-shaped latches for the cooling fan then apply pressure to the back of the chipset.  Over time, this pressure pushes away at the back of the chipset and its seating.  Until finally, boom, the soder holding the seating in place starts to come undone and the system's processing chip just sits there, stupid and disconnected.  <br/><br/>Microsoft's fix for this?  A reconfigured motherboard.  Known amongst fans as the "64-nanometer chip" for the new size of the processor chip that was installed in the new config, this setup moves the placement of the chip itself, uses a different cooling fan entirely, and replaces the chip with a smaller one.  This <b>greatly</b> reduces the problem that leads to the RRoD.  The 64-chip was initially released only in the halo 3 xb360 bundle, though rumour is that it is now available in any box that has an HDMI port in the back of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_158776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MPOSullivan" title="MPOSullivan"><img alt="MPOSullivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/581/nMZWSVRTOY7XL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MPOSullivan">MPOSullivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158776/#Comment_158776" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-26T11:49:08+00:00" title="July 26, 2008 11:49AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>PS3 Backwards Compatability</b><br/>...is a joke.  <br/><br/>When the system was first put on the market, the PS3 was available in two SKUs.  The smaller 20-gig and the larger 60-gig.  Originally available for 500 and 600 USD respectively, both were hardware-driven backwards compatible.  This amounts to parts taken from the "slim" ps2 box and integrated into the ps3.  These boxes had very reliable BC that played the vast majority of ps2 games, and a good eighty percent of psone games as well.  <br/><br/>Then the boxes just didn't fucking sell.  Partly due to a terrible fucking ad campaign, but mostly because of sticker shock.  People couldn't justify spending USD500 for a "tard box", and USD600 was just un-fucking-believable.  Match that with a very poor initial release window, and a good eight months of crappy games to follow, and no one on the planet wanted a ps3.  <br/><br/>In what many industry pundits can only call pure arrogance Ken Kutaragi, lead of the Playstation brand at Sony, believed that people the world over would buy "his" system because it was Playstation and that meant you had to buy it.  There were no other options.  Even if that meant spending upwards of USD700 just to get the system, a game, and an extra controller.  This led to the worst system launch that the industry had seen since the sad, lamented Dreamcast.  <br/><br/>Ken Kutaragi was asked to resign his position.  new guard replacing Kutaragi came up with the idea to lower the price point on the system.  Now, because this was only one year into the cycle of the ps3, any price drops had to come out of lowered hardware costs.  Out comes the hardware-driven backwards compatibility.  In go different, cheaper hard drives.  And in goes a software emulator, only available for a limited time on the new 80-gig SKU of the ps3.  <br/><br/>The software-drive 80-gig plays about 75% of ps2 titles, with a markedly smaller 55-60% of ps1 games.  The software is being updated irregularly to open up more backwards compatibility, but there are signs that those updates will stop coming pretty soon.  The largest of those signs is the newest SKU that Sony is introducing come the Fall.  <br/><br/>Sony will be eliminating all previous SKUs from the market and trotting out their new 80-gig model.  Available for USD400, this system is a nice set-up.  Including a DualShock3 controller, it's actually not a bad price point.  The only problem is, the system will not be backwards compatible.  Ever.  No hardware, no software.  <br/><br/>Dust off your ps2s, people.  <br/><br/><b>Here's where I wrap things up with my own opinion...</b><br/><br/>I have all three systems.  PS3, Xbox 360, and Wii.  Used to be that the Wii would only get turned on when friends were over and there was drinking.  Now I own Rock Band, so there's no need for the Wii.  <br/><br/>Between the 360 and the PS3, I play the 360 more often.  Much more often.  Microsoft has more exclusive content that I like than the PS3 does.  Don't get me wrong, I played my little ass off when MGS4 came out, but there wasn't much more to love about the system.  Ratchet and Clank and Uncharted are the only other games on it right now that I like.  And most cross-platform titles I will buy for the 360 instead of the PS3 because I find the 360 controller more comfortable.  <br/><br/>I'll tell you the same thing that I tell everyone else when they come to me to buy a new system.  Look for the one that has the games you want to play.  That's why you're buying the damned thing, so try and get the most out of the money you're about to spend.  Look at the titles, the upcoming releases, and whichever system has the list that makes you the most excited, that's the one to buy.  <br/><br/>And now I'm done.  I hope that helped.  And feel free to ask any other questions you might have.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158796/#Comment_158796" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-26T13:56:42+00:00" title="July 26, 2008  1:56PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the detailed replied Michael.<br/><br/>Yeah, my brother will be going for the 360, I guess I'll cash out for a PS2, since that's the console that has the most gamesthat <i>I</i>this, all Premium consoles seem to have HDMI compatability built in.

The PS3 controllers are rechargeable (but have tiny, tiny battery lives), it plays BlueRay, PSN is free, it doesn't break half as much, except when Sony releases dodgy updates, it's isn't absurdly noisy.<br/><br/>I'd buy a PS3 out of the two because the the free PSN, and the lack of the Red Ring.

I've got a lot of friends developing games for the XBox360, unfortunately they're all in the "large testosterone man shoots a lot of other guys while yelling" category. The only 360-exclusives that I really wanted to play at some point were Mass Effect and Bioshock, and Bioshock is coming to PS3 this year.  Like Christian, I like the upcoming stuff for the PS3. <br/><br/>The only thing that totally unequivocally sold me on the PS3 was the region free thing. I'm a bit of a weirdo in that I buy and play a LOT of import games.  I think that was a bold move on PS's part, and wholly support it: I play a lot of import PS2 games and a few domestic ones (and watch domestic DVDs), so our solution up until now has been simple: After exploring a lot of hacked boxes including flip-top and the like, we settled on getting two PS2s: One for the US, one for Japan (and we have a rock solid AC transformer). It was the only way to be sure. I personally think that region-locking games is retarded and makes no sense, but it's been the way things have been done forever so everyone sort of caves in. The result is that a lot of us have to dance through flaming hoops if we want to play titles that are only released in another country (even if we speak that language). <br/><br/>It seems that the only global drawback is that, to prevent a mass exodus of sales from one region to another, Sony is making sure that its premier titles (MGS4, FF, some other titles) have simultaneous releases in the US and Japan, or at least within a few days. All that front-ended localization work must push back deadlines a few months across the board, I'd wager.  Still, that's only for the big guns. I can still buy Ryuu ga Gotoku: Kenzan or the new Siren game (Siren 2 was the best horror game I have ever played for the PS2, it even - barely - beats out Zero/Fatal Frame 1+2) without having to worry about buying a US PS3 AND a Japanese PS3. <br/><br/>The only thing that makes me sad is that I like a lot of the weird PS2/PSX titles that didn't shake things up: The visual novel games, the light action games, the <a href="http://www.gae.co.jp/game/ohokuki/story.html" rel="nofollow">games about being a wife in a lord's harem where you have to do social combat and gossip to find your way</a>.  With the PS3, I'm worried that its colossal graphics capabilities will push studios from making those smaller, creative games for it. Then again, I worried about the same for the PS2 and we saw plenty of weird, fun games for that as well. We'll see.<br/><br/>I still haven't bought a PS3 yet: I was thinking about getting the MGS4 pack mentioned above... but truth is, I'm not interested in backwards compatibility: I'm not throwing away my PS2(s) (well, I might get rid of the US PS2, I only have about 2 games on it and haven't played either in months).  Looking at the prices for the new non-compatible systems coming out later this year, if I had to come into the game owning neither, I'd probably pick up the PS3, then buy a slim PS2 for about $100 extra.  Currently, with GenCon on the way and too much shit to get together, I'm looking at around September (after GC) or November (after I get back from Japan) to buy.<br/><br/>Guy: For you, the PS2 might be the best option for now. There's tons of stuff for it, like nearly 9 years' worth, that you can totally enjoy playing for years to come. Then, in a few years, when all consoles have more titles than they do now (XBOX has the most titles currently, but a lot of them are testosterone games that all look alike; Wii has a lot of games, but all the non-Nintendo titles are shit; PS3 has the fewest games, and they're mostly graphically gorgeous games of little substance) make your "more permanent choice" in 2-3 years.<br/><br/>Hope that helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_158861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158861/#Comment_158861" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-27T10:11:05+00:00" title="July 27, 2008 10:11AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, one thing I did hear about the PS3 and regions: So, there's no region encoding on PS3 games in terms of "put in the wrong region's game, and it won't play" (except for PS2 games, which are still region bound unfortunately: That means that no one outside of Japan will ever know the glory of <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=SmzxmEsTYBE" rel="nofollow">Shinobido: Imashime</a>* or <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=1Rhkl1iY7Wg" rel="nofollow">Siren 2</a>).<br/><br/>But one thing they mentioned was that there is still something like "culturally controlled content".  I don't think this has been used yet, though. But essentially, what they were planning was that if one game came out in Japan, and it had content that was illegal or unsellable in another country (like a sexy cut-scene, etc), that content would be blocked on those consoles.  So on a mega-blockbuster release, they could sell a game to multiple regions, tailoring the game so that it was acceptable to all.<br/><br/>It sounds a little disturbing, but on the other hand I'm sure it was just driven by profits.  So that they didn't have to have their games rejected by other country's censors. Frex (tongue-in-cheek):<br/>* a game shipping to China which has cut-scenes extolling the virtues of Freedom.<br/>* a game shipping to the UK which has cut-scenes where the characters "eat delicious food".<br/>* a game shipping to the US which has cut-scenes showing how gratuitous violence might be bad.<br/>* a game shipping to Japan which is full of graphic lolita sex tentacle rape, but accidentally shows a single adult pubic hair.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>EDIT: I just found out that both titles are available on the EU PS2.  Damn, finally the tables are turned: EU gets some of the best games for the PS2, while the US gets jack. Curses!<br/><br/>BTW, if you end up settling on the PS2, post to your blog, and I'll help you build a list of "must buy games" (you can probably get a lot from eBay pretty cheap). Stuff like Katamari Damacy, Shadow Hearts: Covenant, Biohazard/Resident Evil 4, Persona 3, etc. The good thing about a PS2 means that you can get some of the best titles for it for $10 or less.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158887/#Comment_158887" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-27T14:26:03+00:00" title="July 27, 2008  2:26PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>PS2 [. . . ] build a list of "must buy games"</blockquote>if that happens to be the case, i'd have to suggest Okami and Shadow of the Colossus.  in fact, i'd suggest those even if you end up with a backwards compatible ps3.  they are sweet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_158890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158890/#Comment_158890" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-27T14:33:47+00:00" title="July 27, 2008  2:33PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh, while I appreciate the sentiment, let's stave off PS2 list of games till after I have a console.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158896/#Comment_158896" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-27T15:06:10+00:00" title="July 27, 2008  3:06PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 27, 2008 3:09PM by Thunder_God.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, PS2 question.<br/><br/>Does it matter which version I get? 7700, 7400, 9000, etc.?
