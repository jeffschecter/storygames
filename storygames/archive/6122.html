Good stories end when all introduced story elements have been joined together with no loose ends.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich games do you know that actively support reincorporation? How do they do that?<br/>\n<br/>\nExamples of reincorporation:<br/>\nIndiana Jones: First scene establishes that he hates snakes. Later he faces a zillion snakes that he must cross to get the McGuffin.<br/>\nStar Wars Episode IV: First scene establishes that the Empire is building a death star.

Is it like an end game criteria?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne trick that you can use in almost every game, is to write down a note on an index card with the name of a character, an item, a location etc. Keep the cards visible on the table during play. Nothing requires you to use the pool of previously introduced story elements, but it is easier to remember and you can also point at them and hint other players to use them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136445/#Comment_136445" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-26T06:48:47+00:00" title="March 26, 2008  6:48AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My upcoming game, 44, does this. It creates links among distant characters in the form of agents. Agents are the robots of a nefarious conspiracy -- the Section 44 conspiracy (hence the name). <br/><br/>Basically, the "NPC" agents act as crosses. Crosses are things in one scene that later appear in another scene with different characters, hence "crossing" the identities and meanings of the characters in each scene. <br/><br/>Anyway, as an example, at the start of the game, each player describes who else in their character's life has just been replaced by a robotic machine. These robots then become the "bad guy" roster the GM controls. The creepy part is, as play proceeds, the GM is free to introduce any of his roster among any of the player character's scenes. <br/><br/>Turns out, it really elevates connection among distant characters. It also tends to really creep people out. So, say one character's milkman is now a robot. Another character knows, say, his wife is a robot. When the second character hears the milk truck coming, people playing the game really start to groan. It's fucking great.<br/><br/>And, generally (but not always) these kinds of cross-connections get resolved. For example, often the characters "hook up" later and help each other out -- maybe by defeating that nasty milkman!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/R00kie" title="R00kie"><img alt="R00kie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/R00kie">R00kie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136446/#Comment_136446" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-26T06:51:26+00:00" title="March 26, 2008  6:51AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well Continuum's method of dealing with Paradox, with players noting events which are in their 'yet' (events the know will transpire, or know need an explanation) and having to complete they yet to avoid 'Frag' (damaging effects of time righting itself) has the surprising effect of producing very clean stories where everything gets resolved.

It's no good enough to just bring something back, you've also got to add to it. In Suburban Fantasy/YARPG this is done through a process called wonderization.<br/><br/>Suburban Fantasy takes place in a mundane world, which is introduced by a series of vignettes at the beginning of the game. Then an element of fantasy, called The Strange is introduced. From then on, any element from the mundane world can be brought back and shown that it has a connection to, or has been effected by, The Strange. This is wonderization.<br/><br/>Reincorporating in this way, <i>wonderizing</i> things, is the only way to gain mojo to succeed and advance your character.<br/><br/>So you have a normal suburb with a school and a crossing guard and a corner store and nice little houses. The Strange is a little door in the main character's basement. Monsters keep coming out of this door, and chasing the main character around. He's chased to his school by a monster, and says, "Oh! The Crossing guard puts up his Stop sign and the monster stops!" Thus we have revealed a connection between the crossing guard and the Strange, and the main character's player gets a Power token for wonderizing the crossing guard. The guard can be wonderized again for a second token, but after that, even if he continues to be wonderized/reincorporated he runs out of mojo.<br/><br/>So it's a specific action that I want people to take, linked to the main mechanical reward in the game. Blatant? Maybe. So far it works OK, but the other structures in the game aren't supporting it 100%.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

It's easy to resolve those connections, though. Keeping them going in an energetic middle state is the hard part, and that's what I'm aiming at with wonderization.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd" title="Eric_J_Boyd"><img alt="Eric_J_Boyd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd">Eric_J_Boyd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136466/#Comment_136466" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-26T09:18:03+00:00" title="March 26, 2008  9:18AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Frederick,<br/><br/>My game <i>The Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries</i> heavily relies on reincorporation as a means of shaping the storytelling and generating mechanical currency for the players. Essentially, an "expedition log" is put in the center of the table and story elements (characters, items, ideas, etc.) are written on it during play that folks want to see again. When someone other than the player creating the story element connects it to another one in some way or uses it as the basis of a hazard (the game's GMless), then they receive a point of currency to power their own character's exploits. Since there's a competitive element to amassing currency, players are given a clear incentive to reincorporate on a regular basis. <br/><br/>Remi, Suburban Fantasy sounds like it is coming along nicely.

So it's not neccessarily a resolution mechanic per-se but it's certainly a reintroduction mechanic.  There are a few elements that basically allow you to introduce and resolve the components in a single scene but I think that's kinda rare.<br/><br/>BW/BE subtley supports this through resource and circles rolls.  If you fail either you gain a trait or an emnity that is going to bite you in the ass later on (although the specifics to when is not xplicit it is implicit in the GMs roll as opposition to the characters).  Consequently there is n awesome mechanic in BE that says before you "burn" tech (give technology mechanics) you have to have it apprear in a color scene first.  For instance if you're going to burn up some spiffy armor you might have a scene early on where you're polishing said armor then later you can actual roll for it's mechanical inception into the game.<br/><br/>- Don                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136474/#Comment_136474" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-26T09:36:36+00:00" title="March 26, 2008  9:36AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mountain Witch does this in a big big way.

The Indiana Jones example is a classic case of disadvantages, as introduced in Champions (1981).  The GM is encouraged to regularly hit these, and thus creating recurring issues for the PCs.  This was very much modeled on the recurring issues like Indiana Jones' fear of snakes.   Besides Psychological Limitations, it also makes recurring NPCs via the Dependent NPC and Hunted disadvantages.  There's been some development of this idea, like recently Spirit of the Century has Aspects that fulfill a similar role.  <br/><br/>Cases like the Death Star are encouraged by rewards for completing a mission or plot, as opposed to just rewarding for particular encounters.  So, for example, James Bond 007 (1983) has mission rewards.  <br/><br/>I think the difference between tabletop roleplaying and improv are showing here.  i.e. In improv, there are no character sheets or notes.  Thus, to get recurring bits, you need to remember something created on the spot and deliberately make it recur later.  However, in tabletop RPGs, recurring bits are often generated by specifying bits to recur at the start and writing them down.  Those recurring bits can change -- i.e. you can switch out disads or get new missions or plots.  However, the approach is still very different than improv.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136494/#Comment_136494" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-26T10:37:59+00:00" title="March 26, 2008 10:37AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 26, 2008 10:38AM by lachek.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>The Indiana Jones example is a classic case of disadvantages, as introduced in Champions (1981).

A GM continuously hitting a player with the consequences of their choices during character creation is seen as cruel and vindictive.<br/><br/>A counter-example is 7th Sea, where Backgrounds (which as I understand often act as disadvantages, f. ex. Nemesis) <i>cost</i> points, on the notion that you're choosing flags which provide you with role-playing opportunities.<br/><br/>Also compare Spirit of the Century, where creating a situation where an Aspect affect you negatively is the only way to get resources in game.

The presence of the aspect actively encourages to GM to consider bringing it into play as a character foil.

My Champions GMs (and me as a Champions GM) would frequently do things like bring in PC's Hunteds, without ever being called cruel or vindicative that I recall.  In my experience, we enjoyed having known NPCs like their Hunteds or DNPCs show up rather than unrelated NPCs.  Similarly, my current Burning Wheel GM tries to challenge the PCs beliefs pretty regularly, and we enjoy that.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Reincorporation isn't about recurring elements, but about their role in the story.

It seems to me that most of the examples previously cited, like the recurring NPCs in Shab-al-Hiri or the recurring elements in Universalis or The Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries are parallel to what I was talking about.  My experience of improv was that reincorporation was very loose re-appearance -- as opposed to having an element planned for a specific story function.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>1.

But the only thing that matters for the story principle of reincorporation is how the audience experiences it.  i.e. A flashback matters insofar as when it appears in the story, not when it appears in the fictional timeline.  In a murder mystery, if you introduce the killer in a flashback in the third act, that's not at all the same as having it be an established character.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>2.

You're telling us what we already know and then adding to it in an interesting way.

PTA issues, traits and relations spring to mind. Keys in TSoY is another good example. GURPS disadvantages and D&amp;D languages are examples that the character sheet is not always relevant for the story (I guess this is related to a discussion of flags).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about story elements that are not tied up to a player character? E.g. a crime investigation tv drama, where the murderer appears on screen in the first two minutes of the show?<br/>\n<br/>\nStill in most games, nothing forces the players to reincorporate. They are encouraged to do this, but no mechanic ties this up to the story. Is this because we still very often think in open ended stories?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I'd like to keep the focus in this thread on examples of games that actually does provide a mechanic for reincorporation (and how they work).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136524/#Comment_136524" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-26T12:04:20+00:00" title="March 26, 2008 12:04PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>Really?

The whole game starts with just three cues -- sort of story- or game-seeds, little ideas or phrases that you want the game to be about -- and no other prep.

You can literally start with "my guy is a jock" and the game will take you through the paces of a story, developing the character by figuing out what that one trait means and adding more as a result of the story and what the "jock" does.

That's generally part of King's philosophy of writing and rewriting.  Writing the first draft, as he describes it, is exploratory.  His first draft is finding out what the story is, and includes many bits that go nowhere or non-story-related parts.  In the quote below, he's talking about good advice he got from a friend.  \n<blockquote><i>"When you write a story, you're telling yourself the story" he said.  "When you rewrite, your main job is taking out all the things that are <i>not</i> the story.<br/><br/>Gould said something else that was interesting on the day I turned in my first two pieces: write with the door closed, rewrite with the door open.  Your stuff starts out being just for you, in other words, but then it goes out.

In my mechanic, much like SabreCat's (c), players can reincorporate Insight gained from failure in order to enhance their chances in similar situations.  Any side-conflict not drawn from the main Threat of the game also provides an element to reincorporate (if the players don't opt for advancement).  I've done this in hopes that the game feels more like a cohesive story; I.E., all seemingly-unrelated events are related to the main storyline.  But now that I read Alejandro's ideas on keeping every player the main character, it makes a lot of sense in that light, too.<br/><br/>About the Stephen King rewrites, maybe that backwards-reincorporation would work well for games that don't use linear time.  For instance, after a scene where some element or character didn't make sense, a player could have the option of calling for a flashback which adds more depth to the out-of-place element.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137021/#Comment_137021" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-30T13:46:43+00:00" title="March 30, 2008  1:46PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 30, 2008 1:57PM by Graham.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            See...I think reincorporation is a powerful tool, but we're in danger of generalising it beyond usefulness.<br/><br/>I don't think that writing down something at the beginning, then incorporating it later, is "reincorporating", in the sense it's usually meant. By that token, "reincorporating" stuff from the character sheet isn't reincorporation. It's just incorporating.<br/><br/>Reincorporation, I think, is when you introduce something into the story - in the course of play, not in the preparation - then reintroduce it later. Eric's example, in Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries, is reincorporation.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137046/#Comment_137046" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-30T16:10:29+00:00" title="March 30, 2008  4:10PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Graham here - I take it you are with Remi when he talks about "spiking" the reincorporation with Heigthening as well? (just checking, say if you're not). I know this technique from film writing, where it's sometimes called "Setups/Payoffs" - it's a way to nurture audience expectations.<br/><br/>Shock and unWritten are the clearest examples I can think of right now (I believe I played in that game Hituro/David mentions above, and created elements/minutiae were certainly re-incorporated, but maybe not heightened, so I disagree there) - unWritten actually incorporates reincorporation (sorry) in its mechanics and elements will keep coming back, sometimes changed, as play progresses. (I've only read it, not played yet).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137061/#Comment_137061" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-30T18:46:54+00:00" title="March 30, 2008  6:46PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Burning Empires: you must have a color scene in order to introduce technology that will be used later in the first game.

Yes we mentioned the minutae that we had introduced, but we didn't do so for mechanical benefit. So I don't know where there was a difference between creating a rich fictional world just because that is what you do in a game, and reincorporating stuff for mechanical benefit.<br/><br/>i.e. its not as if future bonus dice required us to grab existing minutiae off the table and incorporate them into the narrative, on the contrary, the bonus dice required us to make new minutiae each time and leave them in the middle of the table.<br/><br/>So I saw the minutiae not as a tool for encouraging reincorporation, but as a method for encouraging us to create a rich and complex setting / fiction with many details. They did that brilliantly, but that isn't the same as what is being asked for. Of course maybe we used them wrong?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137088/#Comment_137088" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-31T05:14:42+00:00" title="March 31, 2008  5:14AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the main issues that showed up in the playtest of Console Legends was that it didn't do this <i>enough</i>.

This discussion has really helped me put my finger on exactly what was (or wasn't) happening, and perhaps now I can fix it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
