It turned out that both the lab assistants were fakes (they were really ninja cyborg human-ant transformers) and that Dr. What had stumbled into a nest of Stygian Cult Assassins!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all thorughly enjoyed the whole game and the control we had over the narrative worked perfectly, meshing well with the action scenes that followed the interlude scenes where we planted seeds of the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne issue I would note is that, due to our ability selections (I picked Damage Control Systems and Covering Fire, Dave chose Force Field and Studied the Schematics) we were nearly invulnerable to harm, no matter how many dnager dice we picked for up each roll; we both finished the session in the 'Vapourised' section of the Danger track, but the highrst hits we had were in 'Bashed' and we each had 6 power tokens! It felt like levlling up was almost going to be a formality, with no real feeling that we were in any danger of losing. Of course, this could be largely due to the fact that there were only two of us and we had picked quite passive, defensive abilities.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kaptainkobold" title="kaptainkobold"><img alt="kaptainkobold" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kaptainkobold">kaptainkobold</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225293/#Comment_225293" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T23:50:22+00:00" title="August 17, 2009 11:50PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And I thought that my family had come up with a bizarre plotline during our game :-)<br/><br/>As for the problems with being invulnerable, I think it will be the powers that see the biggest overhaul in future editions - at least I hope so, as the rest of the game mechanics are spot on in my opinion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
