I'm excited by it, and am participating a game via Wave, where we've juts begun creating systems.<br/><br/>Let me state up front that I'm generally not wild about a) setting stakes (as in: if I win I get xxx, if you win you get xxx), b) pre-narration (as in describing the fictional world etc. before play). I like outcomes of conflicts as well as fictional details to emerge from/via play.<br/><br/>A quick glance through Diapora's SRD could give you the impression that both setting stakes and coming up with detailed information before "play" is vital to the game. I'm aware that systems creation is regarded as "play", but it still looks a bit to me like individual players coming up with their own fictional worlds. I can't help comparing with one of my favorite games Burning Empires' world creation, which provides the group with a very loosely described setting full of potential.<br/><br/>That's my built-in pessimist speaking - can you help me get why a) and/or b) are not issues worth worrying about in Diaspora, why I'm wrong or deluded etc.? Feel free to compare to Burning Empires, it will help me understand, I'm sure.<br/><br/>I'm still excited about Diaspora, despite this, I have to say. But I'd like to hear some thoughts about it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251981/#Comment_251981" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-22T03:01:38+00:00" title="January 22, 2010  3:01AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't own Diaspora, haven't played it and I only skimmed the SRD, so take this with a grain of salt, but:<br/><br/>a) Diaspora is based on FATE, which does not use stakes-setting. I therefore presume Diaspora doesn't feature "stakes" the way I understand them (the way Dogs in the Vineyard understands them, for example).<br/><br/>b) You do create your systems before "actual play", but it's no different than rolling up a character. How is character creation not pre-narration in this context? Diaspora gives you a cluster of connected systems with a few traits and issues, which you're then free to build upon. I'd say it's far more loose than BE in the sense you don't have a central, preordained driving conflict (humans vs. vaylen invasion). The potential is there, from what I've seen. I have created a couple of clusters based on the SRD and the system creation forces you to think why things are the way they are there (for example a world with few resources but very high tech: how did it come to this? what is the society in that system like? what do they want?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251982/#Comment_251982" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-22T03:28:00+00:00" title="January 22, 2010  3:28AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, the book just arrived - two days after ordering!<br/><br/>From the SRD under Social Combat - I assume other types of conflict are the same:<br/>"set the stakes: establish clearly what happens if the characters win and what happens if they lose"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers" title="James Jeffers"><img alt="James Jeffers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers">James Jeffers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251984/#Comment_251984" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-22T03:52:06+00:00" title="January 22, 2010  3:52AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Per Fischer</cite>From the SRD under Social Combat - I assume other types of conflict are the same:<br/>"set the stakes: establish clearly what happens if the characters win and what happens if they lose"</blockquote>\nDoes that mean, negotiate the outcome details in either case, or does it mean figure out what was at stake (the fate of your ship, or this guy's relationship with the captain, etc)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251986/#Comment_251986" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-22T04:32:08+00:00" title="January 22, 2010  4:32AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Per, we don't always set stakes.

At the end, the Systems have their Tech, Environment, and Resource ratings and three aspects.  That's it.  I prefer to leave a lot of blank space, though; areas that will be filled in by gaming.  To me, the Clusters always seem to have so much more potential if they're left vague.<br/><br/>That's not to say that we don't talk a great deal about the systems.  I encourage a lot of brainstorming, especially in coming up with each system's thurd aspect.  Sometimes, a Campaign aspect comes out of this.  In one campaign, the PCs decided to be based in a Slipknot Station, so we fleshed that out and gave it some aspects.  Again, it was all broad strokes of the brush.<br/><br/>I do have one house rule, though it seemed a natural outgrowth of the Diaspora game.  For each System, I make the player who originally came up with it "ownership" of the System.  That player is the final arbiter of what is and is not true about that world.  If someone asks, "Do the inhabitants of Planet X do Y?" I turn to the player who first thought up Planet X and ask him or her.  I also allow the player to spend Fate Points to make declarations about their system.<br/><br/>In one case, one of my players is working up an extensive write-up of "his" system.  Hey, if it makes him happy, that's fine.  More for me to work with.<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stakes</span></b><br/><br/>I've never really set stakes in Social Combat, at least not in the way you think about them.  Social Combat, to my mind, rarely ends in an "either/or" solution.  It can be more nuanced than that.  I prefer to set "objectives."  Each party involved in Social Combat is trying to achieve something.  If we place these objectives on the Social Combat map, we can see how close they get to it.  <br/><br/>I also prefer to save Social Combat for complicated scenarios.  If it is an "either/or" situation, than it can probably be resolved with a single opposed die roll.  If there are three or more outcomes/sides, then Social Combat can really shine. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Hope this helps you out.  I really like Diaspora, and I hope you have fun too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251997/#Comment_251997" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-22T07:12:53+00:00" title="January 22, 2010  7:12AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeffrey hits the nail there regarding stakes. While the social combat section encourages you to set stakes, you will find that, first, it's really about establishing two ends of a spectrum of outcomes -- if we win the planet goes to war, if they win the slavers are discovered and captured. But ultimately the outcome will be the interpretation and narration of the board state at the end of the combat with those "stakes" as a context, and it will rarely be as clear-cut as we hoped when we "set the stakes". The social combat example (not in the SRD) illustrates this well, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252021/#Comment_252021" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-22T08:47:02+00:00" title="January 22, 2010  8:47AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With social combat, I have set up our Diaspora combat in a much different manner than say, our Duel of Wits.<br/><br/>In DoW, it is one character versus another, with the other characters contributing via helping dice.<br/><br/>In Diaspora Social Combat, I find it works better with different factions within a group being effected in a kind of long term montage scene.<br/><br/>Let's make up one and see how it goes:<br/><br/>The players are Anthropological Engineers, attempting to thwart the spread of fascism on a planet.  They land and start manipulating society.  There are three characters, the Psychic Empath, the Soldier and the Historian.  The planet has three factions - the Scared People, the Popular General and the Religious Zealots.  I like having one NPC participant for each player but I am sure there could be wiggle room for this, especially if the PC's are cross-purpose.<br/><br/>So, we have a piece of paper up which we put the map.  On the map are four quarters.  Let's say on the four quarters we write Imperial Republic, Democratic Republic, Fascism, and Torn by War.  In the corner of each area we have some sub-areas.  <br/><br/>In the corner of Imperial Republic we get War on Neighboring System and Cold War with Neighboring System.  In the corner of Democratic Republic we  maybe futz with the Cold War with Neighboring System so that it fits into this one too (because we like it) and also put in a sub-area, Peace Negotiations with Neighboring Systems.  In Fascism, we have Progroms against Off-worlders and Trains Run on Time.  Torn by war has Nuclear Wasteland and World War.<br/><br/>The characters each start where they would like to see the world end up.  Then, we decide that this will be a four round social combat, ending at the end of the fourth.  Characters arrange themselves based on who has the highest Blah skill (the skill that is the most relevant for the conflict).<br/><br/>Then, throught he combat, we get the status quo of the planet after the manipulation.  The players can see that the planet would have been headed towards Fascism and nuclear war without them and through Social Combat, they move people around and shift the going's on of the planet with their skills, describing how they are doing so.<br/><br/>The end result is a total fucking mess, with everyone all over the place and the planet as a complicated political powder keg that will be further effected by play.<br/><br/>Hope that helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252040/#Comment_252040" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-22T10:13:01+00:00" title="January 22, 2010 10:13AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeffrey, Brad, yes, makes perfect sense.
