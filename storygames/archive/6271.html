I decided to start doing this as a learning exercise, and, yeah, I'm learning stuff.  A good 90% of what I'm doing so far is just formatting and swapping out mechanical bits, though there are a few touches that are really all mine, things I'm hoping to develop out of the text that I really dig.  Three days, and I'm on page 26.  <br/><br/>While I do this, I'm listening to the Theory From The Closet thing with Clinton and others.  <br/><br/>And it keeps biting at me.<br/><br/>My easiest work, my smoothest, fastest stuff, and the stuff of mine that people enjoy <i>and play</i> the most?  All  conversions.  Taking things others wrote and splitting them down, streamlining parts of them, giving them a new spin; <i>Perfect 20</i> is a good example of this.  I've written games that I think are pretty damn good, but they took forever to grind out, and were work; rebuilding stuff is an unqualified pleasure - and comes with the added joy of knowing that more people will play those games.<br/><br/>And, really, most of the time, I'm not entirely cool with that fact.  It's kind of uncomfortable.<br/><br/>Now, it would be convenient for me to put that on the community.   That thinking it's somehow a lesser thing to convert than it is to create is the <i>fault of other people.</i><br/><br/>But it's not really true.  At least for me, it's not some outside pressure to get status.  It's an internal pressure to make something I can hold up and say "That all me, baby" - even though, really, that's patently bullshit even when I do say it.<br/><br/>I look over at the idea of what how easy things would be if I could just let go a little bit, do the thing I really am best at, and take as much pride in it as I do when I make something of my own.<br/><br/>Gah.<br/><br/>Anyway.  I felt the urge to drop this here because I'm wondering if anyone else here has something like this, lurking in their head somewhere.  And if they had any thoughts on it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/alejandro" title="alejandro"><img alt="alejandro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/alejandro">alejandro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138940/#Comment_138940" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-10T01:29:00+00:00" title="April 10, 2008  1:29AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello Levi,<br/><br/>I'm working on my game unWritten, right now, in fact. It started out as a game that was completely my own thing, but after a few years of not being able to get what I wanted out of it I discovered Otherkind by the big V. Baker. And I immediately fell in love with its potential. Don't get me wrong, OK is a great game, but I saw what it could do for my game so I started ripping it apart. Eventually, I got what is now unWritten. I'm SO happy with it. OK is still in there, but unWritten is totally it's own thing now. For example, I only have 3 conflict squares instead of 4. That may seem different, but it really changes the flow of the game.<br/><br/>Anyway, all that to say, I've hacked someone else's game. It is now my game, and I'm totally happy with the results. I have no compunctions for using the OK. In fact, I appreciate Vincent creating so that I could hack it. I truly believe that deep down, Vincent made OK just for me... Well maybe not.<br/><br/>I get your hang up, but really, I don't think you're any less of a designer if you hack rather then design from the bottom up. <br/><br/>Alex                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138941/#Comment_138941" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-10T01:40:24+00:00" title="April 10, 2008  1:40AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: alejandro</cite>I don't think you're any less of a designer if you hack rather then design from the bottom up.</blockquote>\nOdd as it may sound, I don't think that <i>anyone else</i> is less of a designer when they do so, either.

On the Forge, the default response used to often be "Follow your passion and do whatever really gets you going," but my passions can be really weird and uninteresting or nigh-unplayable for other people sometimes.  Creating hacks of existing games with specific playgroups in mind allows me to 1) ensure they get played and 2) make awesome gaming experiences for other people.  If they turn into publishable products, like <i>Geiger Counter</i> did, fine.  If not, well, like Billy said, the play's the thing, yeah?  Honestly, I often feel like this community would be healthier if people designed for play first and publication was optional and much, much further down the line, instead of the default for any design work worth a damn.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138961/#Comment_138961" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-10T07:19:17+00:00" title="April 10, 2008  7:19AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Levi, I'm totally with you, I feel exactly the same vibe of "man, conversions / tweaks were the most fun to write, but I'm not a REAL designer because I haven't made one from scratch."<br/><br/>And it's me more than something external...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138969/#Comment_138969" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-10T07:47:22+00:00" title="April 10, 2008  7:47AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's the default response, just for Walton:  Do what you love.

For me this is because novelty and innovation are likely to be correlated, and I'm very interested in innovation.  So you get a sort of negative feedback loop where your good work goes unnoticed by your peers because it does not promise something ostensibly new and noteworthy.  I'm not suggesting this is healthy; it is in fact both inaccurate and unfair.

I'm a child of d20, that's where I cut my designer teeth, and while I do more than that now, my design experience has always been more of the 'hack something that's done and proven' than the 'create something new.' And I totally felt the pressure (regardless of where it came from, or if it was real or not) as I started to become a part of this community that I had to do something new and original to be held as an equal. Until I started to realize logically that Judd Karlman (to pick a name) was held at the same level and he had done a system hack for Sorcerer, and that his upcoming game is a system hack for TSoY, so why not me? <br/><br/>It's all internal bullshit for the most part, but it is there, unsaid, unspoken, but undeniable. The truth is that there is no effing difference between creating Perfect20, creating E6, creating a new prestige class, and creating a whole new game: it's all design. Yes, the level of complexity vary, the challenges are different, the rewards are very particular, but it's all design, and no one, absolutely no one, should feel they are less because they do one over the other. I admire people who can come up with a whole new system on their own, but I equally admire someone who can grab d20 and make it dance the fandango.<br/><br/>If there is one thing this designer community should improve on is being receptive and understanding and frankly supporting of other game designers, regardless of where their design passions lie. You don't have to be a cheerleader or follow every single design project. Some people are more attracted to original designs, others to hacks, and you should pay attention to what interests you more, yes. But it doesn't take much to make sure that in paying attention to what you like most you also give some sort of prop to the others. In the end we are all designers to some extent, and peerage will only be achieved when we treat all as such. You want to end the toxicity of status? Start by behaving as if there is no status to be had, start by behaving as if we are all the same: gamers and designers and people who enjoy the process of creation and the rewards of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139020/#Comment_139020" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-10T10:06:56+00:00" title="April 10, 2008 10:06AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Levi, you inspired me to <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/2008/04/10/the-four-elements/" rel="nofollow">self-reflect on this subject</a> and how to get what I want out of design and play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/alejandro" title="alejandro"><img alt="alejandro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/alejandro">alejandro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139053/#Comment_139053" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-10T11:13:40+00:00" title="April 10, 2008 11:13AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 10, 2008 12:16PM by Andy.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite> For me this is because novelty and innovation are likely to be correlated, and I'm very interested in innovation.</blockquote>\nJason Morningstar: I'm a little confused by what you said.

There's plenty of reasons for the normal individual action, and thus the community, to tend towards paying attention to novel ideas, and to being able to just HEAR about a mash-up and go "Oh, okay, not interesting."<br/><br/>And that's all to the good.<br/><br/>I don't think that the community is being bad when it does these things.  I don't think that the whole "Oh, hey, so what are you working on now?" bit from the TFTC podcast is anything but a natural outgrowth of genuine enthusiasm.  Nor do I think that the status-effect of (mostly) original design work is inherently toxic and bad.<br/><br/>I think that all of that is the normal "base state", if you will.<br/><br/>If anything, I think that the frame on the conversation has been placed upside-down.  It's not a question of <i>what is wrong with the community that causes these effects.</i>  This is not a sign of evilbadwrongness.  <br/><br/>These effects are <i>natural</i>.  That we, as cool people that want to support one another, are sort-of sometimes looking for ways to break down the status barriers between designer, havcker, player, all that?   That's an attempt to be more than is the basic state, not an attempt to fix something bad we're doing.  It is a sign of being really fucking cool and supportive as a crowd, and framing the current thing in terms of "toxic" and "problematic" is silliness.  When you want to be totally awesome, starting by saying "everything sucks" doesn't actually help.<br/><br/>I think that maybe, we could try reframing it that way around?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139113/#Comment_139113" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-10T14:47:29+00:00" title="April 10, 2008  2:47PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Peer?

I'm glad!  Three observations, helpful or not:<br/><br/>1.  Personally I'm not that interested in hacks.  That keeps me at arms reach because right now it just isn't my thing.  I probably have that in common with many people.  I have a long, long list of things to play and think about and right now none of you are on it.  This is not a reflection on any of you or your work.  It is a reflection of the 24 hour day.<br/><br/>2.  I think you all ought to do a couple of things.  First, fucking own it.  If you want to be considered a game designer than call yourself a game designer, because you are, so who is going to object?  I'd think hard about why you want that, why that is important (answer:  status) but if you do, just stop wringing your hands and be the thing.<br/><br/>3.  If you want to interest people in your work, stop calling it a hack.  This is cynical and fucked up, but there it is.  <i>The Roach </i>is, in many ways, a hack of <i>Polaris </i>and <i>The Mountain Witch.</i>  I provide attribution and copious thanks to Tim and Ben in the book, which is only right.  But beyond that, it is its own thing and I label it as such.  If you have a thing that's diverged significantly (<i>Unwritten</i>, <i>Red Box Hack</i>), stop calling it a hack and I bet people will be more interested in it.  To recap:  Cynical and fucked up but probably effective.  Be a little arrogant.  Be a little proud.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139228/#Comment_139228" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-11T07:29:35+00:00" title="April 11, 2008  7:29AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>My problem is: I spend lots of time working on something that I think might be cool, and then find out that someone else has already done it better.

How is it bollocks?<br/><br/>I run into this <i>all the time</i>, and it's a huge disappointment - not for status reasons, commercial viability reasons, or whatever. Think of it this way - you just figured out this awesome way of making a flushing mechanism for a toilet that uses 1/2 of the water most do and is equally cheap, effective and serviceable. You fine-tune it, prototype it, test it, fine-tune it again, and so on, until it's as perfect as you can get it. Sweet! Now all you have to do is manufacture a bowl and a tank and you can sell it, or if you're not looking for commercial success, install it in your own home and enjoy your lower water bill.<br/><br/>So you go online and check out possible bowl designs, and then you come across a small vendor in Kansas who carry this line of inexpensive toilets which use 1/4 of the water most do. They have a demonstration of their mechanism design and it's almost exactly like yours, but solves a nagging problem you couldn't figure out.<br/><br/>So you now have three choices.<br/><br/>You can fix up your own design to match the better one, but it would be a rip-off. If you wanted to install it in your own home, you'd still spend more money and time on manufacturing a bowl and a tank than it would cost to just buy one from Kansas.

Sometimes a credit statement at the back of the book just doesn't feel enough. I agree that titles like RBH have gone waaay beyond their source material, and such potent credit-giving isn't really appropriate anymore.<br/><br/>But it's also an ad - like "if you like pulp, you've heard good things about SotC, but don't want to learn a new system - check out Levi's d20 SotC hack!".<br/><br/>"Levi's d20 SotC hack" is a way more interesting title to a d20 and/or SotC aficionado than "Levi's Pulpy Goodness".

And every session in our LONG, ongoing campaign has been great fun.<br/>* My L5R Hack not only brings all the boys to the yard, the player's are like, "It's better than <i>yours</i>". Pop lyrics aside, it's working great (mashup of L5R's core rules, TSOY's keys, Fan Mail and Spiritual Attributes). My hack is really hacked.<br/>* Ryan S's "E6" Hack for D&amp;D 3e basically turned a game that I found frustrating (I worry about my character's eventual 15th level feats when I draw her up at first level), wiped those off my "worry plate" and in their place replace it with an awesome fantasy/tactical gaming experience. *<b>I fell in love with D&amp;D 3e again</b>* because of Ryan's e6 hack. His stunt hack is cool, too, but E6 brought the bacon.<br/><br/>Hacking old school 90s games into playable (to me) fun has become my recent love. Even more so than following the latest hot new game idea.<br/><br/>I'm sure that the hack will come out where someone hacks some game I just have no interest in, or hacks a game in a way that I just can't get into (because of different goals, etc). But I haven't found it yet of the ones I've played.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139331/#Comment_139331" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-11T14:50:32+00:00" title="April 11, 2008  2:50PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 11, 2008 2:51PM by J_Walton.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most of my games started out as hacks before gradually becoming their own things.  For me, hacks are often a way to bang out a draft of an idea by using the core of something else.  Sometimes, that's all you want, to use most of an existing system, with some add-ons, to run a neat idea for your local crew.  That's Andy's L5R hack right there.  It takes L5R and makes it into something that the group is excited about playing.  If, later, Andy decides to head further down that road and make the hack into its own thing, something he can share with other groups, then I think it stops being a hack.  Like how Red Box Hack isn't really a hack anymore.<br/><br/>So... in my mind.  Hack = alternations for your home play group.  If it goes beyond that, if bunches of people are using your hack, congratulations, you just made a free supplement or something.  You can still call it a hack, if you like, but it probably needs its own name, like E6.  And the next step after that is making it a totally separate game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139386/#Comment_139386" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-12T06:22:01+00:00" title="April 12, 2008  6:22AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Levi,<br/><br/>Have you ever written a game with end game mechanics?<br/><br/>I'm not sure you can write a game that's all you, unless it has an ending.
