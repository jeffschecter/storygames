IIRC, one can flip a number of coins equal to a stat, and compare total that come up heads. There may also be some kind of "superpower" rule regarding other denominations; for instance, a nickel may be re-flipped once; a dime, twice; etc.<br/><br/>In general, their use is very high-handling: between counting them out, tossing them en masse in the air, sorting successes (and re-flipping, if able), and picking them all up again, you have a lot of fiddling with small metal bits. This is, of course, exacerbated in a LARP where folks are wandering around--invariably, a "mass combat" turns into a huddle of folks crouching and tossing coins on the floor. Not exactly "high verisimilitude" when it's supposed to be a bunch of vampires in an alacrity frenzy melee....<br/><br/>What sort of use as a randomizer do you intend? A "d2" has such a narrow range that, invariably, you have to scale efficacy by introducing several or making denomination matter somehow (multiplier, re-flips, etc). I suppose one could MAYBE do something by painting pennies and using a grab-bag, blind-draw method to broaden the effective "range," but that's hardly using their 'coinness' (Hey! I coined a new word! heh...); different colored glass beads would do the same (as would poker chips, etc).<br/><br/>HTH;<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137871/#Comment_137871" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T10:25:25+00:00" title="April  3, 2008 10:25AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Binary is awesome.

The easiest way to generate those strings that I've been able to come up with is by tossing a handful of coins of different sizes.  (Yeah, this is in spite of the very real handling time issues that David identifies)<br/><br/>I am resisting using coins because they conflict with the color of the game (this issue is being discussed over in the playing cards thread).

You can get complex results quickly using playing cards, even if you're just counting reds and blacks.<br/><br/>You can't do that easily with coins. Sure, you could say "You get five tosses, you need 3 heads to succeed", but it takes time.<br/><br/>So, to answer the question, I think that's the reason coins aren't used much. It takes too much time to create random stuff, compared to using cards or dice.<br/><br/>(As an illustration, think of the number of traditional pub games that use cards, then the number that use coins. I can think of lots of card games and only one coin game, and that's Shove Ha'Penny. I think that's an illustration that, in games generally, coins are a bit cumbersome.)<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher" title="Marc_Majcher"><img alt="Marc_Majcher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher">Marc_Majcher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137997/#Comment_137997" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T15:39:55+00:00" title="April  3, 2008  3:39PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've got a semi-munchausenesque pirate themed storytelling game sitting around somewhere that uses coins and cards (representing "steel" and "rum") for different types of resolution.

It's kinda clumsy, etc. Maybe cupping your hands and shaking them around might work, though.<br/><br/>However, one thing I think coins would be awesome for is resource management. GM says "How much [ASSASSIN POWER POOL] are you going to use to kick in that door?" You look at your sheet, see that you have a score of 20 and falling. You cup two dimes in your hand, and three quarters, and hold your palm out. The GM does the same. The GM reveals two pennies, indicating that this task was a difficulty of "2". You reveal your 2 dimes and 3 quarters: In reality, you spent "3 points" (quarters) to do the action, and the dimes are in there as a cover, to jingle and make noise in case you ended up only allocating 1, or 0 points to the task.<br/><br/>Something like that (Marvel Stones) is awesome IMO. Randomizer? Not so much. At least, not All The TIme.

It still wasn't as fullfilling as dice, as they were often difficult to read quickly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138069/#Comment_138069" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-04T03:12:17+00:00" title="April  4, 2008  3:12AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The game I'm in the middle of playtesting uses coins as both a randomizer and resource management.  You flip the coins usually only once or twice a game, and then the faces showing are the resources you have to spend until you flip them again.  There are coloured stickers on the coins to make the information more complex than "yes" and "no".  <br/><br/>It works well in this context because it's easy to flip the coins and then leave them on the table, wheras dice tend to get fiddled with and re-rolled by mistake.  Since you're only flipping them rarely, the extra handling time isn't a problem so much.  Coins also feel right for the game, which is more-or-less free of randomization otherwise.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.rpgbakery.com/forum/comments.php?DiscussionID=55&amp;page=1#Item_0" rel="nofollow">Compass Gods</a>: Playtest draft (very rough) available here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138072/#Comment_138072" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-04T04:46:20+00:00" title="April  4, 2008  4:46AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another aspect of coins is variation in diameter, which is an element Kevin and I plan to exploit in our vampire robot game - you lay paths on a map, using coins, and larger coins cover more territory.  You then pick up the coins that form your paths and use them as resources and randomizers.  And stuff.
