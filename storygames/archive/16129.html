You don't succumb to temptation, you don't worry about you're hands or back failing, or getting a bloodborn pathogen. It's much like combat in RPGs.

Better how? Despite people trying to explain how all religions are essentially the same, the value of traits and behaviours varies between  religions and cultures. You can actually find a codified example of this in Pendragon: Christian knights value Chastity, Pagan knights value... whatever the opposite of that is called in the system.<br/><br/>To play someone who is more X than you, I guess that you have to do some thinking before playing. If they value X, what behaviours does that cause? Why do they value it? How far are they willing to go for X? (You have to think of this beforehand because otherwise in play you might slide to your "default" value of X). Also: why do you want to play someone who values X?<br/><br/>[Edit: also, I guess that when playing, you need to make sure to roleplay or describe the internal conflict of the character, and how they decide to support the values they care about despite the cost, otherwise they'd just be paperthin characters.]<br/><br/>For example: we're playing in a pseudo-Viking setting, where hospitality is of high value. I'm playing a local lord and by gods, I will lead my men and women by example. That means being an example of hospitality (among other things).<br/><br/>What behaviours does that cause? Hospitality means I will greet anyone who arrives at my house. I will postpone taking care of current affairs (meals, talks, etc) to greet and invite the guest, as well as give orders to the servants to see to their needs. I will make the guest's safety my responsibility and my own honour. And finally, if the guest is of high enough status, if they say they like something of mine, I might consider immediately gifting it to them.<br/><br/>Why do I value hospitality? Well, hospitality draws people to you and I want to be the leader of a great clan. If I'm hospitable, I'm encouraging people around me to believe we have enough of our own so that we can even share. (Good PR!) And finally, my life was saved one wintry night when I almost froze to death but was rescued by a stranger, who made me swear I would repay his deed in kind - to others. He only had one eye and I'm secretly convinced that was Odin.<br/><br/>How far am I willing to go in order to be hospitable? I will take in anyone, regardless of their status (class). Now, I imagine the looks of my peers when I speak to an escaped thrall that arrived on a cold night. I will share my last food with them. Now, I imagine the looks on the faces of my family as I generously share a bag of grain with my men - but they know that it means they will eat gruel for months to come. I will insist that conflicts cease among the guests in my house. Now, I imagine being manipulated into hosting a meeting between two sworn enemies - and both insisting that I will become THEIR enemy if I do not help them eliminate the other one.<br/><br/>Now I feel better prepared to play someone who's more hospitable than me <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368088/#Comment_368088" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-16T07:40:46+00:00" title="March 16, 2012  7:40AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stay silent.

(Easy or difficult, depending on the circumstances.)<br/><br/>Break or limit the above rules only in accordance of code of conduct that the character might follow, whether its a code expressly created by some organization or community, something that's considered important to the culture (and the character sees as enlightened), or a personal code of honor that is relatively unique to the character. (Usually really hard, depending on how natural that code might feel.)<br/><br/>OR I intentionally want the character to be acting less enlightened, perhaps to show how much the current situation is stressful or emotion-full or because the character might be abandoning those ideals or breaking until the pressure of holding to them as a major personal crisis or approaching change. (Usually the most fun part, so it's hard to do with restraint.)<br/><br/>Being enlightened is not a mystery, and the things enlightened people do are not complex. We've got tons of religious and spiritual writings that all say essentially the same thing when you clear away the oppression, politics, and dogma that's been added to control people. It can be summed up as: Treat everyone else with the utmost respect, compassion and understanding.<br/><br/>Case in point, following that general rule would still have you fit right in as 3Jane's example of an enlightened Viking if you knew nothing about Viking culture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368491/#Comment_368491" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-19T12:20:36+00:00" title="March 19, 2012 12:20PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Ask the GM to share stuff with you that none of the other characters know.</blockquote>\nAsk the GM to treat you like a Vineyard Dog and write the ethos of the setting yourself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
