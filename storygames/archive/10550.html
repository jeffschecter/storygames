This is all part of my plan to step up Galileo Games\u2019 production schedule. I released Mortal Coil Revised earlier this year, and I\u2019m very pleased that I will have managed to get a second game out in the same calendar year.<br/><br/>In anticipation of the release, I\u2019ll be posting some cool How We Came to Live Here related materials, including some of the final art for the game along with a special surprise. I anticipate everything being ready to go to print in the next couple of weeks, and as soon as files are sent off to the printer I\u2019ll be setting up a preorder on IPR. The printed book should be available by November.<br/><br/>For those of you not familiar with the game, How We Came to Live Here is a Native American fantasy inspired by the myths and archaeology of the American Southwest. Players take the role of heroes who must try to achieve their own ambitions as well as protect their villages from the many threats that loom outside. This is complicated by the temptation to sin against the traditions of their People. Two of the players take the role of the Inside and the Outside. Their duty is to create conflict and hardship for the hero players, either through family ties and rivalries on the part of the Inside player, or through monsters or natural forces on the part of the Outside player.<br/><br/>Keep watching this spot for new stuff as the time approaches!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234167/#Comment_234167" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-24T18:31:48+00:00" title="September 24, 2009  6:31PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2009 6:35PM by Burr.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting.  Random question: in actual play, do the Inside and Outside players usually collude or compete with one another?  It sounds like you've basically got two GMs; I'd love to hear more about that works in your game.  Or should I patiently wait for the next teaser?<br/><br/>Oh!  And how fantastic does the game get with the religious/mythological aspects of Native American culture?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor" title="Brennan_Taylor"><img alt="Brennan_Taylor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor">Brennan_Taylor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234199/#Comment_234199" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-25T03:46:21+00:00" title="September 25, 2009  3:46AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Inside and Outside players cooperate. Players all take turns setting scenes, including the Inside and Outside players. They have a big influence on the direction of the game, obviously with a lot of input from the Hero players as well.<br/><br/>The game can be more or less fantastic depending on taste, it all depends on what elements the players bring in. Religion, sorcery, and monsters are all sort of baked in, however.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234201/#Comment_234201" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-25T04:21:32+00:00" title="September 25, 2009  4:21AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeeeeeeah, but religion, sorcery and monsters were also baked into the cultures you drew from, so there's that.  As long as everybody accepts their efficacy at face value, you could totally run a non-fantastic game!  It'd be fantastic!<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to seeing the finished product, Brennan!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor" title="Brennan_Taylor"><img alt="Brennan_Taylor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor">Brennan_Taylor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234334/#Comment_234334" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-26T04:39:08+00:00" title="September 26, 2009  4:39AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://bit.ly/rSOb9" rel="nofollow">Listen.
