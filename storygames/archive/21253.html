But when I'm done, and I look at the results, I realize that my new character is remarkably like a character I've played before.  And I then I feel disappointed with myself.<br/><br/>It feels like a slump.  Like I don't have many new ideas?   This doesn't happen when I'm in the GM seat of my Monsterhearts game, or while I'm playtesting my side-project.  And, of course, similar characters in different stories will end up really different, so perhaps I'm just being hard on myself.  But still: I'd like something new and challenging, but it's hard to find my way there.  And I really don't want to start second-guessing every move I make while creating new characters; no-butting yourself is rarely productive.<br/><br/>Has anyone else struggled with this?   How did you work through it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465603/#Comment_465603" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-14T17:36:57+00:00" title="August 14, 2017  5:36PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've handled this phenomenon by recognizing that it's natural, and not nearly the problem it's often made to be. Essentially, I think that the hidden premise here ("Players should express creativity in their character designs the same way a GM expresses his in campaign development") is faulty, despite having been pounded into our heads by traditional dominion theory of roleplaying.<br/><br/>(The "dominion theory" is, of course, this: "The GM has creative control over the setting. The player has creative control over character." When you stare at that framework long enough, as most of us have done, you start thinking that it implies that players should be creative artists. After all, when you <i>only</i> have creative control over the character, that obviously means that you should be using that control to be amazing, right?)<br/><br/>Thus, my recommendation: think long and hard, question your assumptions here. Is it really necessary for each player character to be a work of art right out of the gate? Are the games you play really supporting that? Do they actually make use of the originality of character? What are you, or the game as a whole, getting out of it? How would the game be different if you just played Harry Callahan (or whoever your go-to character is) every time?<br/><br/>Maybe you'll come to conclude that yes, the games I play really don't work well if my character isn't a clever and unique masterpiece out of the game. If you get that far, then I'll hazard that you'll also be a lot closer to figuring out how to make the character into such a masterpiece, because you've obviously understood the precise mechanisms in the game that utilize that character uniqueness - and when you understand <i>that</i>, you'll be in a much better place to actually pull those levers.<br/><br/>Or, you'll come to conclude like I have: the vast majority of the games I play don't care one whit of how unique my character is. Often it's not even possible to make unique characters without breaking the game. In fact, many games work better when my character is easy to understand and archetypical, as that way the other players understand the character better and faster. Often the character takes on an unique nature during play, but that's exploratory play and not character design.<br/><br/>If anybody here thinks that they can name a game that actively requires novel high-quality player character portraiture as part of game prep, I'd be interested in hearing about it. I have a few candidates myself (hint: they're all princessing games), but frankly I am not at all convinced that even the best ones <i>really</i> benefit from uniqueness of character, rather than simply not being harmed by it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/paganini" title="paganini"><img alt="paganini" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/paganini">paganini</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465605/#Comment_465605" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-14T17:48:01+00:00" title="August 14, 2017  5:48PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is both a good question and a bad question!

To know that, I need to know what your old practices have been. Maybe you've made a gazillion rich and unique characters already. There are a limited number of human problems, so a certain amount of repetition is inevitable. In that case, maybe you don't really have a problem. <br/><br/>On the other hand, maybe every character you've made keeps turning into the ex-military loner who carries a black long-sword and has a demon girlfriend. <br/><br/>So... yeah those are two extremes, but the point is I need more info about where you are in relation to them. What makes a character distinct to you? How he looks? The things he can do? His past experiences? The people and social circles he has relationships with? His emotional attachments? His ethical / moral ideals? <br/><br/>A related issue is, what rules do you typically use? A perennial problem in RPG design is that many system offer you a large number of mechanical choices that don't matter much. That is, you have many mechanically distinct but blandly similar characters.<br/><br/>- N                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tam_H" title="Tam_H"><img alt="Tam_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tam_H">Tam_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465606/#Comment_465606" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-14T17:56:26+00:00" title="August 14, 2017  5:56PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're just looking for fresh inspiration, make a few d6s lists and roll on them!

Here's a definition:<br/><br/><b>Princess play:</b> An agenda of play where the player focuses on depicting an interesting character being interesting - cool, pretty, strong or whatever floats your boat. Princessing is often immersive, but it doesn't have to be. Princess play is distinctive in that the strong and specific vision of what the character is like comes primarily from the character's player, and it is not questioned as part of play; the character should not face set-backs that cast doubt upon the character's identity.<br/><br/>As a simple example, in my experience Exalted and modern D&amp;D are often played as princessing games: the point of playing the game is that you get to create and develop this cool character who gets into fights and does a lot of victory poses and so on. The events of play may feature stuff like combat or drama, but their deeper purpose is to spotlight the characters who engage in those things. The fight exists so your character can show off how cool they are in a fight.<br/><br/>Of the various sorts of games that come to mind as candidates for actually benefitting from unique characters, a princessing game seems to me the likeliest sort. Even there, though, I know many people who specifically want to princess play rather stereotypical characters - one of our players created a dwarf fighter who uses an axe, carries grudges and is fond of honor when we played a bit of 4th edition D&amp;D recently, for example. It could be that some people simply have pretty staid imaginations and that's what counts as an original character for them, but I rather suspect that perhaps uniqueness simply isn't a requirement for princessing in 4th edition D&amp;D...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM" title="Mongrel_GM"><img alt="Mongrel_GM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM">Mongrel_GM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465608/#Comment_465608" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-14T21:47:57+00:00" title="August 14, 2017  9:47PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Assuming it's not your PCs' attributes, abilities, or appearance that are seeming repetitive, try this:<br/><br/>Here's a stupid trick I sometimes use when I'm feeling brain dead. I pull up a random word generator and let it spit some words at me. If something jumps off the page, I go with it. Or perhaps it instantly evokes a related thought. If that doesn't happen for you, try creating a chain of words with one or more of the generated words as a related anchor. <br/><br/>But one caveat. I think you would be better off playing a character you can relate to which might be less novel as opposed to a very off-your-usual-path PC whose motivations you can't really identify with. But who knows, maybe that would be a fun PC to explore and figure out.<br/><br/>Myself, having played so much fantasy of a certain vein, I've often said that playing a party of 13 dwarves, a halfling and a wizard would be a mold-breaking and fun campaign. Sometimes it's all about what we haven't been getting to do in our gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465609/#Comment_465609" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-14T23:15:31+00:00" title="August 14, 2017 11:15PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel your pain because I've gone through it.

Have one character switch into another. It doesn't have to be a totally new character but something that has a major impact on your current traits. For example, I played a half-orc that were the leader of the group and I had planned that he was going to go through a religious crises. Another example were a magical forest spirit that wanted to explore the human world, but the more she learned and became human, the more she lost her magical abilities. Be sure to tell the game master about your plans so s/he can include these changes into their adventures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarlosLuna" title="CarlosLuna"><img alt="CarlosLuna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/043/n8G0MTMMVZLJN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarlosLuna">CarlosLuna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465610/#Comment_465610" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-14T23:48:18+00:00" title="August 14, 2017 11:48PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something in the line of John Fiore's <a href="https://plus.google.com/113913096608545423730/posts/2VCXxWkmVHQ" rel="nofollow"><em>Aladdin Technique</em></a> might help:<br/><br/>1.- Write a brief background for the character.<br/>2.- Identify several key elements in it.<br/>3.- Randomly alter some of these key elements.<br/>4.- Develop further the character by embracing the new elements.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tam_H" title="Tam_H"><img alt="Tam_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tam_H">Tam_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465619/#Comment_465619" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-15T03:14:49+00:00" title="August 15, 2017  3:14AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I'm guess I'm into princessing then; that's a big part of why I play, to see my interesting heroes do interesting things and to torment them into being ever more awesome. It's how I GM too. I think I need to look into play agendas!<br/><br/>To OP, it might help to figure out why you always play the same type? If you always play rogues who skulk in the background, maybe you don't like social stuff, and a brusque fighter could shake it up a bit but still give you the experience you want. Or if what you're looking for is the "jack of all trades" vibe, a bard. Stealth and invisibility, an illusionist. And so on.<br/><br/>You might also consider, if you like the "type" you keep building, if there are unexplored angles that could make it feel fresh again. A Cinderella-type becomes a gladiator instead of a house servant, a wizard's long-suffering apprentice becomes a necromancer's Igor, a Robin Hood becomes an imposter who really does have a murder haunting him, and so on.<br/><br/>My next character is waking up in a white room with amnesia.

(I think a character's *actions* in play are a far more interesting element to explore here, instead. Ultimately, it's the character as defined *in play* which is important here, and that's an organic process you can't control entirely by yourself.)<br/><br/>Without understanding your exact issue (more specifics, please!), it's hard to give targeted advice, but here are two ideas which come to mind:<br/><br/>1. "Mad Libs" character creation. <br/><br/>Come up with a character idea (it can be the same idea you used in your last game, no problem), but leave a few blanks.<br/><br/><i>This character is obsessed with _________. He desires revenge against _________. Her approach to her chosen field/specialty is fundamentally shaped by her relationship with her parents: in her childhood, her father ___________________________________________.</i> <br/><br/>If you have the material to play with, you can randomize these. (Simply assigning your character's gender at random, for example, could do a lot, particularly if being of a certain gender means something specific in your setting - e.g. a fantasy setting where only women can perform magic, or a game set in the Catholic Church.) Are there four possible factions in the City? Let's roll one at random to be the character's most hated enemy. And so on.<br/><br/>However, open-ended blanks are even more interesting:<br/><br/><i>It is prophesied that the character's destiny is ______________________.</i><br/><br/><i>Among the clergy, my character's reputation is ________________________.</i><br/><br/>Come with a couple of such blanks in your next character, and then hand the character over to your fellow players. "Ted, tell me what my character's childhood was like. Lucy, what does my character believe her Destiny is, as seen in a dream vision?"<br/><br/>Let the other players fill in those blanks, throwing a twist into your character concept. I guarantee you'll end up with something you didn't expect, and a fun roleplaying challenge.<br/><br/>You can go even more open-ended, like so (this is a good general technique):<br/><br/>"My character is a veteran of many political campaigns, and closely connected to big finance. How is she unique - how is she completely different from anyone else who would fit that description?"<br/><br/>Sometimes you can answer that yourself, and it's enough. Better yet, though, ask the other players to each offer you an answer. (And, as a bonus, they'll be more interested in your character as a result!)<br/><br/>2.

Unless the character is pre-written, in that case I'll just play the character I'm given to the best of my ability. This is fine for one-shots. But for campaigns,  definitely prefer to create my own, or I lose interest. I lose immersion.<br/><br/>I haven't had a problem playing the same type of character myself, mainly because I never, ever get to be just a player. I'm always the GM.<br/>However, I have seen players wanting to break free of their habitual character types, often with unplayable results. In order to do something different, they mostly created something so outrageously different it was gamebreaking.<br/>Play what you enjoy, and play what fits the setting.

Thanks for all the feedback!  You\u2019ve all given me a few new lenses to apply to the situation.  Sorry it\u2019s taken me a couple of days to respond; life and a Monsterhearts game happened, and I can only really get on here on a cellphone during the day, which made responding to all this a bit tricky.  But here goes:<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/eero_tuovinen">@eero_tuovinen</a> I see what you\u2019re saying, and I totally agree that uniqueness is overrated, and that clarity of design and being able to embrace the moment and explore the character during play is more important.  However, the elements you bring to a character design at the outset change the possible outcomes of where your character may go over the course of the game.  For example, if I include an important recent death in my character\u2019s backstory (as I often do \u2013 it\u2019s one of the elements that I\u2019m seeing repeat), that shapes the outcome of where my story will go down the line, and the toolset that your character has with which to understand the world.  I want those points that speak to me about my characters, because I want those wonderful moments of bleed!  Thanks!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/paganini">@paganini</a> this spoke to me: \u201cMaybe you've made a gazillion rich and unique characters already. There are a limited number of human problems, so a certain amount of repetition is inevitable. In that case, maybe you don't really have a problem.\u201d It may be the case that I\u2019m being hard on myself a bit.  I\u2019ve been playing for a long time, and I\u2019ve been getting used to a new group of players over the past two years, and perhaps I\u2019m being critical of myself in a way that I ought not be critical of.<br/><br/>To your question about making a character distinct (and this is helpful thinking, thank you), I suppose that emotional attachments and past experiences are the part where I feel like I\u2019m struggling.  My characters tend to have an important sibling or family member who my characters are a caretaker of, current or former lovers who are also active in the story, who feature as my important NPCs.  The character\u2019s various traumas are an element here, too:  recent deaths (often including ghosts of those people \u2013 sort of Flower for Mara-y), loss or estrangement of family members, struggles of feeling responsible for people that I take care of vs. wanting to live my own life.  Stuff like that makes characters feel unique.<br/><br/>Actually typing this out is making some of these pitfalls a little more distinct, and perhaps more easily avoided.<br/><br/>I tend to be attracted to and play games like Primetime Adventures, Monsterhearts, and single-sitting games like The Skeletons, Ribbon Drive, or Jackson Tegu\u2019s various Patreon games.  I also dig on freeforming.  My favourite games play strongly to some kind of emotional state, and/or play with relationships.  I want to feel things when I play.  Thanks!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Tam_H">@Tam_H</a> Neat!  It sounds like you do the same thing with oracle cards as I do with tarot cards!  I like your questions, too.  I\u2019d love to have an more extended conversation with you about this, and trade ideas with you?  Injecting some new ideas into a technique I already use might be very helpful.  Thanks!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM">@Mongrel_GM</a> I like your random word generator idea a lot.  And I totally agree about needing to be able to understand PC motivations.  It\u2019s something that holds me back from just asking someone else to make me a character, or going full on random in my creation.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a> I like the idea of playing through major changes like that.  This is a useful idea.  Thanks!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/CarlosLuna">@CarlosLuna</a> Interesting idea.  And it would be easy to direct this towards elements that I\u2019m not happy with.  Thanks!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> So here\u2019s a more specific example:  I sat down a few weeks ago to build a character.  The game was about a group of ghost-policing agents working for CSIS, so ghosts and supernaturals are an element.  Over the course of creation, I made an agent who had been recently dating his boss, in secret, until she died on a mission, and he felt responsible for her death.  She was still hanging around as a ghost, and they were still dating.  The character was sort-of wizardy themed, and was very focused on the past.<br/><br/>After I had sat back, I realized that this was an ad-mixture of other elements from other characters: I had played a wizard a few years before, who was ghost themed.  Basically all of these elements were present in that character, the only notable exception being dating his boss-ghost, which is an element from a different character I played a few years ago.  When I realized that, I felt unsatisfied with myself.  I feel like I\u2019ve explored this space, before.<br/><br/>This has happened twice before, recently.  This is just one example.<br/><br/>Your madlibs idea is neat, though, especially when I include my fellow players in the making of characters.  We do a fair amount of cooperative creation already, so I think they would be open to this sort of idea, and provide useful feedback.  And I think an interesting roleplaying challenge would help a lot.  Thanks!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Tore_V">@Tore_V</a> But what to do when you cease to enjoy the thing that you\u2019re playing, right?  I\u2019m questing to find a new thing that I enjoy.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">@Jason_Morningstar</a> This question, in particular, speaks to me:  "What sort of character would you enjoy seeing me play? What do you think would be challenging and fun for me, based on what i usually gravitate toward?"<br/><br/>Especially if this is a forest/trees situation for me, then perhaps asking for this sort of guidance would be helpful.  Thanks!<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Thank you everyone!</b>  I feel like my problem is a little more defined in my head now, seems a little smaller, and seems a little more manageable.

Thanks!<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nExcellent! So, for my first thought, I will use a sort of parable or metaphor about game design. Many years ago I was active on a Yahoo group called "RPG-Create." (Still a member, in fact). Every year or so someone would start a discussion about "What are the best Attributes for an RPG?" We all of us (myself included) were awash in Platonic thinking. We would very sincerely investigate the topic with the attitude that there existed - somewhere out there - an ideal form of RPG design with the perfect set of ability scores, or stats, or whatever, and that if we just thought about it hard enough we could discover what they were. It never occurred to any of us (or at least, not for a long time) that an RPG just *might not have* universally shared scalar descriptives attached to each character. <br/><br/>We took it for granted that it was part of an RPG's identity as an RPG that it have some set of things like STR, INT, WIS, DEX, CON, CHA, even if that particular set wasn't a very good one. <br/><br/>I wonder if you are taking it for granted that story-play characters, structurally, are made of these grabby engaging components ( emotional attachments, etc.) but forgetting that the point of them is to grab and engage *you.*<br/><br/>You said "I want to have feelings when I play," and I absolutely agree with you! But structural components are just tools; they don't guarantee feelings. You can make structurally perfect characters and situations that conform with glittering precision to narrative theory etc., but if you personally don't have feelings about them they're pointless. <br/><br/>If you're bored by yet another family drama, or yet another troubled past, ditch it! What will grab your attention right now and makes you go *I WANT TO PLAY THIS CHARACTER?* <br/><br/>So, this might sound weird, but, read more philosophy, especially ethics. Read the news. When something really grinds your gears, make a note of it. That's an issue to hang a character on. <br/><br/>My second thought is, you might be well-served to just stop worrying about this stuff ahead of time. You're going to know, when you need to know, what it is about the character that zaps you. I have the perfect game for you to do this with, and it just happens to be one of my favorites: <a href="http://adept-press.com/games-fantasy-horror/trollbabe/" rel="nofollow">Trollbabe!</a> <a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> and <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> and I have been trying to scramble up some actual play in the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23indierpgs&amp;Mode=like">#indierpgs</a> IRC channel on irc.magicstar.net, but Real Life (TM) keeps intervening. You're welcome to join the fray!<br/><br/>One of the design features of Trollbabe is that it pushes back against games like Bushido where you have a plethora of trivially mechanically distinct characters. That is, there are lots of permutations of mechanical choices to make, but they all are more or less the same aesthetically, or where it only makes sense to play a small subset of the available characters. <br/><br/>In Trollbabe there are only 8 mechanically distinct characters. The rest of character creation is straightforward visual in-the-moment description. Character creation takes like 10 minutes or less. And then all of the things you're accustomed to frontloading your character with and that are currently causing you mental suffering are developed through play. <br/><br/><br/><br/>- N                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465664/#Comment_465664" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-16T19:22:56+00:00" title="August 16, 2017  7:22PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Colin,<br/><br/>That's very interesting! Having more insight into your situation gives us a lot more to work with, and I'm glad you're getting some good advice in this thread.<br/><br/>My advice for you would be:<br/><br/>a) Start by asking the other players what/who they'd like you play. What does this game need? Who does *your* character need to play against, or as a foil? Etc. Maybe that will already solve your "problem"! But, if it doesn't...<br/><br/>b) Don't try to be original. Instead, allow yourself to create the outline of a character who fits the very "template" you're trying to avoid. Do all those things you're tired of; make a "stereotypical" Colin-character, intentionally!<br/><br/>c) Pick a couple of things about the character which seem really important or central to you. Maybe it's the dead lover, or their social identity, for instance.<br/><br/>For each one, either:<br/><br/>* Turn it into a "blank", then ask the other players to fill it for you. ("My character has a relationship with a dead person. Who are they, and what's the relationship like?")<br/><br/>* Deliberately "invert" it; make it the very opposite thing. Maybe instead of a ghost lover they wish was still here, it's someone who almost killed them, and instead of protecting them, it's them who craves forgiveness from your character. Or, maybe, if your character was a team leader, now they are a mole in the organization. And so on.<br/><br/>I think that would get you your results pretty quickly and effectively!<br/><br/>You can also play around with randomness as a tool. I have a few suggestions along those lines I've fooled around with:<br/><br/>* <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/12372/dogs-in-the-vineyard-meet-random-character-creation" rel="nofollow">Dogs in the Vineyard Random Character Creation</a> uses "themes" and "statements" to create your character.<br/><br/>You could make your own such list of themes and statements by writing down all the things that your characters have in common, and then randomizing them to make a new one. That will create interesting variations on a theme for you, occasionally reinforcing it and occasionally breaking it!<br/><br/>* <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17956/it-all-ends-in-tears-monsterhearts-and-fiasco" rel="nofollow">It All Ends in Tears</a> is a customized Fiasco-style playset I've made for Monsterhearts games. The cool thing it takes from Fiasco is that it defines your relationships to the other characters *first*, and only then do you define the character. Between the table elements and the starting Backstory questions, you get a character in a situation you wouldn't normally have chosen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465669/#Comment_465669" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-16T21:40:11+00:00" title="August 16, 2017  9:40PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            beyond the wizard, ghost and lovers/siblings it seems your main themes are <i>loss</i> and <i>responsibility</i>. May sound cliche and not your regular turf but have you tried <i>betrayal</i> or <i>revenge</i> ? What about <i>coming of age</i> and <i>coming to terms with mortality</i>? Slap over any of those a particular emotion or set of emotions as an answer. What about a revenge... using happiness? Like, making your enemies believe you're back to kill them only to show them (and yourself) that you're actually ready to let it go and show them your best smile as your actual revenge, because despite all they did, they couldn't break you and the experience only made you stronger.<br/><br/>Of course it isn't fun without inner conflict, the character emotions could go from one side to the other; keeping it simple, perhaps the character is sometimes tempted with actual revenge and must fight to not become like their former betrayers. Or it could be <i>doubt</i>: perhaps they did broke him beyond recognition. Has he really found inner peace or is this just denial?<br/><br/>So there, maybe focusing a bit on a couple of emotions or another theme may give even the same type of characters a totally different vibe by making it more dynamic, making it progress in different interesting directions. Hope this helps a bit too. Also, great ideas here everyone!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465680/#Comment_465680" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-17T02:46:53+00:00" title="August 17, 2017  2:46AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that, WarriorMonk. Consider taking one of those themes, but letting the other players (including the GM) figure out what the real deal is.<br/><br/>For example, "I have back to get my revenge on my old mentor, because I believe she did [X]. But is she really guilty? Will her death settle anything?" Then tell the group that you hope those answers will be answered in play - not by you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin" title="Colin"><img alt="Colin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin">Colin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465710/#Comment_465710" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-17T16:31:37+00:00" title="August 17, 2017  4:31PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/paganini">@paganini</a> <blockquote>I wonder if you are taking it for granted that story-play characters, structurally, are made of these grabby engaging components ( emotional attachments, etc.) but forgetting that the point of them is to grab and engage *you.*<br/><br/>You said "I want to have feelings when I play," and I absolutely agree with you! But structural components are just tools; they don't guarantee feelings. You can make structurally perfect characters and situations that conform with glittering precision to narrative theory etc., but if you personally don't have feelings about them they're pointless.</blockquote>\nThis spoke to me, in particular.  I\u2019ve also had friends I play with say things like that they had no idea I was struggling, because my characters were <i>technically</i> good\u2026 and I guess I hide it well in play?  Perhaps deliberately questioning if the various parts of my engagement components are still working, or aren\u2019t, would yield some interesting results.<br/><br/>Your note on philosophy and ethics is probably also a good thought.  This has worked for me in the past, but it\u2019s a well I hadn\u2019t thought to return to.<br/><br/>I haven\u2019t played Trollbabe, but I have wanted to.  And playing with new people is generally good.  I would like to take you up on that.  I\u2019ll haven\u2019t used IRC before.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> <blockquote>a) Start by asking the other players what/who they'd like you play. What does this game need? Who does *your* character need to play against, or as a foil? Etc. Maybe that will already solve your "problem"! But, if it doesn't...<br/><br/>b) Don't try to be original. Instead, allow yourself to create the outline of a character who fits the very "template" you're trying to avoid. Do all those things you're tired of; make a "stereotypical" Colin-character, intentionally!<br/><br/>c) Pick a couple of things about the character which seem really important or central to you. Maybe it's the dead lover, or their social identity, for instance.</blockquote>\nThese all seem like excellent suggestions, but particularly B and C.<br/><br/>This also kind-of highlights an issue that may be holding me back:  We tend to create our characters together, as a group, with everyone contributing to everyone else\u2019s characters, and linking everyone up socially.  But once we do, I\u2019m reluctant to revisit my character if there\u2019s something I\u2019ve identified as being something I\u2019m not especially happy with; it feels a bit like no-butting to me, which (just-now realizing that that\u2019s why I\u2019m reluctant) is silly for me to apply here.<br/><br/>And also, I\u2019ll look into these.

I tend to <i>react</i> to problems the same way with most of my characters.  Deliberately acting outside of that mode \u2013 perhaps particularly because it\u2019s outside of my regular turf \u2013 may go a long way towards making me feel like I\u2019m playing different territory.  Anger/revenge reactions, in particular, are hard for me to portray.  Which seems like a great reason to go very deliberately in that direction.
