When I hear the word "character" I think of character in a story, like a book, movie or whatever else. The way I was always taught you do this well, and the way that its always worked for me in my own writing, is looking as characters as change in process, to make they dynamic. So when someone says "Think up a character." My mind, almost reflexively goes: okay, its this person and then they can grow like this. Having these arcs in mind seems like a bad idea though... because in play they've just proved frustrating, because no one I know, at the table, wants to buy into these kinds of arcs, to see them come into fruition. Do other people address these kinds of things in play? Do they use a lot of pre-planning in character creation?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288411/#Comment_288411" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-23T21:54:29+00:00" title="August 23, 2010  9:54PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll take a slightly less dismissive crack at this...<br/><br/>You're not writing and you're not reading. You're not the author. You are a participant, one among many, and that's pretty cool! But if you come to the table with your writer skills and mindset, you are likely to irritate people who came to improvise a story, as you recognize. Improvisation is a separate skill and a different process. I'm going to go ahead and break the glass and get out the awful identity politics words: What you're asking, I think, is "My friends dislike it when I Story Before. How do I Story Now?" <br/><br/>If I'm right, well, maybe you would benefit from not making your own character? Or from playing a game with a very collaborative chargen process? Might be a useful exercise. Maybe you should GM a game that shackles you pretty tightly, something by Vincent, or perhaps InSpectres? Or something that rules out prep altogether, like Penny or Fiasco (Fiasco hint - don't decorate any of the cards adjacent to you, only the ones across the table). Or try a game that celebrates characters' disposability and incompetence, like Paranoia or Call of Cthulhu. One way or another, if you want to learn improvisation, you need to go in raw and get out of your comfort zone from the beginning - and if your friends tell you that you're doing that thing that irritates them, take it in a constructive and fun spirit and resolve to do something different.<br/><br/>Or play with people who think your style is more fun, of course. Or meet your friends partway. Lots of options.

I am not bad at improvising or at limiting my character concepts to fulfill the conceits of the game. If I'm playing BESM and the author says "Make a stereotype, don't think ahead." (which is a paraphrase of the game text) I can do it. I just have fun thinking about the character as a unit in a story as opposed to a person. Simple as that. I get a lot of resistance to this at the table when I play with the people I play with. In Forge-terms this is a stance thing (as I understand it). The people I play with dislike it, but thats not the main point of the post... Its to discuss this idea of character arcs and working them into play. Luke Skywalker, for instance, is only a compelling character (at the beginning of a New Hope) as an arc. He's not a person, he's an archetype that will go through a given set of changes. A movie goer (or at least a savvy movie goer) knows this from the word go. This is not Story Before, per se, because its all about how Luke gets there, not that he's going to change. Han to, is an arc. I know these are movies and not games, but since this is something that a person wanting to make good stories in any other medium takes for granted, what role do they play in RPG's?<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean, my approach and the approach of people I play with are definitely at odds with one another, but that is not what I was looking to discuss.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288414/#Comment_288414" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-23T23:10:49+00:00" title="August 23, 2010 11:10PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: masqueradeball</cite>I mean, my approach and the approach of people I play with are definitely at odds with one another, but that is not what I was looking to discuss.</blockquote>\nUh, well, but I think you have to discuss it, because I think that's the root of the problem.  As long as you stay flexible, your approach sounds like it works fine with Story Now play.

If I come to the table with a campaign and expect a dramatic arc, if I have a story in mind, it's going to get shattered into a million pieces once it meets the PCs. Either that or they start railroading. (And the players start pouting and saying "that's what my character would do"). Expecting the character to change over time, that's awesome. Expecting <i>how</i> he will change over time, now, that gets a little problematic, depending on the game. Having an end point in mind...no way, except if the social contract and/or the game actively support it. If we're talking about Story Now, Story Now is about "play to find out what happens", not "play to get to a certain conclusion".<br/><br/>Now, I'd like to hear more about what kind of resistance you get at the table? Saying it like that just sounds weird to me, I can't imagine what goes on...are the people saying to you: "Dude, you can't make character arcs!!" or...what? How do they identify your stance and how do they reject it?<br/><br/>To go on: As Colin said, roleplaying is not writing and you're not an author at the table, at least not in the traditional sense. Roleplaying is Death of the Author to the max. But this is not a reason why a character couldn't be like a literary character. In fact, I think RPG characters SHOULD be like literary characters. However, what defines literary characters is not their dramatic arc: that's their story, not the character. A character is a position, a point, not a an arc. As the story goes on, that point draws an arc, but is not an arc himself.<br/><a href="http://www.lumpley.com/anycomment.php?entry=224" rel="nofollow">http://www.lumpley.com/anycomment.php?entry=224</a><br/>"Imagine Thatcher's London. Imagine a person in Thatcher's London who has everything to lose. That's a character. That's a whole, playable, complete character."<br/>A character is an agent in a story. Story is produced when that agent meets obstacles or other agents, which creates conflicts.<br/><br/>Another thing: Later on you say...<blockquote>If I'm playing BESM and the author says "Make a stereotype, don't think ahead." (which is a paraphrase of the game text) I can do it. I just have fun thinking about the character as a unit in a story as opposed to a person. Simple as that. I get a lot of resistance to this at the table when I play with the people I play with.</blockquote>\nSo you get a lot of resistance at the table when <b>not</b> thinking ahead? Was the conflict in the first post not about how you think ahead, making an arc and that's a problem for the others in your group? Again, I redirect you to my question in the middle of the post. I can't understand the social side of the issue here.\n<blockquote>I mean, my approach and the approach of people I play with are definitely at odds with one another, but that is not what I was looking to discuss.</blockquote>\nI dunno, to me it seems that's almost the only thing to discuss here...Your question in the first post is about system. System is about people at the table. How do we handle character arcs when they're not in the rules? We (should) agree on it, by talking and compromising and stuff. "How do we address it in play?" is fundamentally a social dynamics, social contract, creative agenda type of thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288418/#Comment_288418" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T00:17:04+00:00" title="August 24, 2010 12:17AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2010 12:18AM by masqueradeball.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your totally right about the fact that system ultimately boils down to how people interact at the table. Whats the problem at the table? The opposite of "I will make you awesome." When I think of a character it almost always comes out as: "I want to see how character X gets from point A to point B" its just how I'm wired. I can unwire, and I do as much as I can when it rubs against other people, but when I talk about where I want things to go with my character in the game, its made clear (in subtle ways, mostly just by being ignored) that those kind of interests/expectations are ignored. I do think that there are more general things to discuss... throughout my 20 some years of game playing I've played with maybe three or four distinct groups of people, and almost all of that has been running game. Since I switched to being primarily a player, I've always thought in arcs, in, wouldn't this be cools, its been ignored in favor of a if-it-happens-than-it-happens approach. When I ran games, if I were to run a game, barring specific goals established before play begins, I would love for and cater to players coming up with arcs for their characters. So no one I know uses pre-planned characters arcs in play. I wanted to know how a larger gaming community felt about these things and how they would handle them in play. I mean, when I think of making a story, even a group story, it seems like the best thing to start with is the end point. I know this is not something implemented often in RPGs, if ever. I mean, I've never seen a game do it. Also, I want to hasten to add that just having a plan for where your going doesn't mean that you want change your plans along the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: The BESM thing was just misleading. The resistance wasn't to how I handled BESM, but to the more general approach I have of coming up with arcs first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288423/#Comment_288423" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T01:38:49+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  1:38AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            hum.<br/>\n<br/>\nintresting...<br/>\n<br/>\ni have been playing around a bit with character types. here is what i have found<br/>\n<br/>\nA comic relief or a brigand/anti-hero are two character types that play very strong at the table. There is an instant sort of "HA you did what!" or for the brigand it's like "oh no he didn't!" both types sort of lean on shocking the other players. It's something that hits quickly and is easy to understand and absorb (performing humor or anti-hero is still hard)<br/>\n<br/>\nPulling off hero means you have to get past shock and move to awe. This is hard to do in a game where player's don't have much freedom or the gm does not want to incorporate it. If no one else at the table has read your back story they wont know how cool it is that you just broke your "death oath" or some such.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that does not mean this kind of character is impossible to play, I recently had one player who was quite successful with the hero role, granted the game gives him to power to some times set scenes, describe the resolution of his actions and tell short stories abut his character progression. So I think those are some tools that help.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I wanted to have a character ark in a usual game I would keep it to myself and look for opportunities to express it as play, no reason to spoil the story for the other people at the table.

I do want to stress that these arcs aren't always about how the character rocks it. Downfall, actually, seems much more supported in games. Call of Cthulu is pretty much a game of "how does your character descend into madness." If you play it long enough, you'll go crazy.

In a game with a GM, you really need GM buy-in at a minimum, although another player can absolutely help with that; in a GM-less game, you need at least one other player.  Otherwise the best you'll ever manage is an occasional monologue...and if you're at all aware of the other people at the table, you'll know what a terrible idea that is.<br><br>So anyway, the first rule of buy-in is <i>know your audience</i>.  If the GM is dead set against incorporating your ideas for your character's arc, then either there's no interest in "pre-planning" a character arc, or your ideas of what makes a character arc interesting...aren't.<br><br>So try changing things up.  If you've been hammering on specific beats you'd like to see ("...and then he would confront his old master!"), try making it more general and more attitude-focused ("...so the more good deeds the party accomplishes, the more my character will realize that he needs to let go of his past, and he'll stop being angry and taciturn and start enjoying himself more!").  Or vice versa.  Try just putting out an ending point, with no other details.  Try not mentioning an end point at all, and just focus your attention on what can be done in the current session ("My character is getting more desperate; after our failure at the mill, he's convinced that if we don't stop this guy NOW we'll never stop him at all...and his reckless streak is really starting to come out.")  If you've been doing one particular type of character, try a different one.  Try keeping your idea a secret, but design your character to make the arc you want to create almost inevitable (a character destined to turn evil just happens to have features that really benefit an evil character, etc.).  Basically, keep throwing new ideas out until one sticks and you finally start getting a feel for what kinds of arcs would actually get traction with these people.  It would be weird if ALL your ideas sucked, right?<br><br>Also, try talking about it with the GM outside the game sometime, just when you're hanging out doing something else.  As a GM, I always found it easier to work in player suggestions and desires when I had some prep time to think about them; if you dumped your idea on me five minutes before we started playing, I probably wasn't going to do much with it...but if you'd mentioned it a few days earlier, I'd have probably come up with something interesting for it by the weekend.<br><br>Worst case scenario:  you're right, and you'll never get what you like gaming with these people.  Bummer.  It happens, but that never seems to make it any easier.<br>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: masqueradeball</cite>I wanted to say... how do people use or not use story arcs when creating characters, Everything else was pretty much a "this is why I ask."</blockquote>\nSometimes I do, but I generally keep it very vague and focused on who the character IS (personality, beliefs, goals, etc.) rather than on what the character DOES (actions, relationships, milestone events).  I generally throw that shit in during character creation -- "I'm going to play a grizzled, alcoholic PI who starts off with a fear of responsibility...but as the game goes on, he'll have to start taking on responsibilities, and form real relationships with people, and generally become a better person."  I'll also stack the actual character sheet to make that happen -- the PI in that example actually started off with good leadership skills and empathy, because the whole idea was that the only thing keeping him from being a better person was his fear of making real connections with the world around him.  If he sucked at that stuff, there wouldn't be much incentive for him to step up and take responsibility, right?  But the way I played it during the game, he was just discovering that he could handle things if he made the effort.<br><br>I do a lot of reinforcement and refinement of "big picture" ideas like that outside game sessions, too...but our gaming group is made up of friends who hang out and do non-gaming things together all the time, which makes it easy to have conversations about the game: how everyone thinks it's going, what we like about our characters, what we hope to do next, and so on.  We get psyched about what other people are doing with their characters, and we conspire to set up situations in-game that will let people go after what they said they wanted to do when we were watching TV two nights earlier; the character who wanted a romance will find other PCs are pushing eligible NPCs in his direction, or the barbarian struggling with her bloodthirsty nature will find herself shoved into the spotlight when the party has to decide what to do with the surrendering bandits.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83" title="Jumanji83"><img alt="Jumanji83" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83">Jumanji83</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288428/#Comment_288428" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T04:33:19+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  4:33AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello Masquerade Ball.<br><br/>You are going to need to find a new group to play with. That may not be easy, it might take a while, but ultimately, it doesn't sound like your current gaming experience is satisfying to you.<br/><br/>Also, I suggest you drop BESM. I suppose you CAN have character arcs with it, but there is nothing in the design of it to suggest so. If you play games with the idea of character arcs written in the design, it'll be easier for you to make it happen with your group. (Not with your CURRENT group, I think, don't try to stealth Story Now into your group, it won't work.<br/><br/>Having an end to your arc in mind isn't so bad as you'd think, as long as you are ready to change your mind forty times in play. Those games go in all directions at once, players each have much more impact to push the story in the direction they want. The plot is often at their mercy. If you have a character arc in mind, it often includes some kind of events that may not occur. What then?<br/><br/>Say you play a war vet with post-traumatic shock disorder. Your first thought is to play through an arc in which he gets better. That's fine. Your advocating for your character, that's cool. But he might not. He might stay the same. He might get worse. He might turn to drugs or become homeless. He might hurt someone he loves. He might get better just long enough to save everyone and then die in the process. Or he might get better and live forever after.<br/><br/>But don't choose before you play. Play the PTSD to the hilt, react to the situation in the way that makes most sense to you or that seems most interesting. Let the conclusion write itself naturally.<br/><br/>Now I have some game suggestions :<br/><br/>In Hero's Banner, you'll play a young noble who must pick his life. They are torn between three influences (hero, blood, conscience), each exemplified by three different ideals, and three different goals. You should strive to make the three goals equally interesting to you, and the GM, if she does her job, will try to make the choice as difficult as possible in play. At the end of your session, you can only achieve one of those goals, the other two are lost. You then epilogue your character, describe how that choice affected his life, and then you describe his death.<br/><br/>In Primetime Adventure, each character has an issue (grief, romantic troubles, teptation, etc.) and a Screen Rating that varies from episode to episode. You get one Spotlight Episode, in which is going to beabout your character and his issue. You can resolve his issue, or not. But this is the only place where it can be resolved in-game. <br/><br/>Don't Rest Your Head : You get asked a few questions as part of character creation. One of them is "what just happened to you?" You get to pick your own story hook. "My baby brother was kidnapped by goblins and its my fault. I need to find him before mummy and daddy return from the movies." "I was reading some boring old book while on acid and I saw a white rabbit with spectacles and a pocket watch running through a hole, and I followed it. I could have sworn it talked, too. It said "you're late! you're late!"<br/><br/>Then you get asked another question : "what is your path?" What are your character's goals, both short and long term? "I want to find my baby brother, but I wish my parents would pay a bit more attention to me. I also hope to be a better big sister in the future." "I wish to find that white rabbit, and figure what he meant; also, I'd like to find the strength to kick off drugs."<br/><br/>(I don't think my examples are very good. Aw well.)<br/><br/>Another game you could check out is The Shadow of Yesterday, there is a free wiki out there. Check out keys. You choose how you character is rewarded. Say your character meets a villain, you can say she falls in love with him, take the key of unrequited love. Whenever this love is displayed in the story, you gain xp. The more trouble it brings you, generally, the more xp. If the love is returned, or if you opt to abandon your love, you can also decide to buyoff that key forever, for a whopping 10 xp (yes, 10 xp is a big deal). You could also buy a new key. In fact, you may have as many as 5 keys in play at the same time.<br/><br/>Also, in the same game, check out transcendance. You have five ability level. Unskilled 0, Competent 1, Adept 2, Master 3, Grand Master 4. A Grandmaster can never fail. Also, a perfect success at Grandmaster level translates into Transcandance. Your character effects some great change to the campaign setting, and then exits play forever, somehow. Could be death, could be ascending into godhood (also often known as death) could be something else entirely. You aren't ready to transcend? Don't use an ability at grandmaster level! Indeed, just don't ever advance to that level until you are becoming ready.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aik" title="Aik"><img alt="Aik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aik">Aik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288435/#Comment_288435" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T06:15:10+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  6:15AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2010 6:15AM by Aik.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To throw out another system that does what you want: Archipelago.

Really. If you make someone who you will enjoy watching life kick the shit out of, then no matter what the plot is, your arc is damn-near guaranteed. Just get the shit kicked out of them, make terrible blunders, and do you learn something from it? Or not? That's the question you don't answer up front.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm getting at is that you can reduce your problems with this practice without really changing the practice by:<br/><br/>* lopping off the very end of the arc, making it more about a question about the character (Edit: you kinda need to do this with all aspects of a character in an open-ended campaign, don't close anything up until you've opened something new.)<br/>* using what you say you're already doing - making a character to fit a campaign - to create a non-disruptive arc that will fit <i>in general</i> the events of the campaign. For me, it's an asshole getting their comeuppance, and THEN what do they do?<br/><br/>(I don't suggest new games/groups, I figure if people want those they can go and get them.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288448/#Comment_288448" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T07:29:30+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  7:29AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: masqueradeball</cite>The only reason this seems a little strange to me is that I've never seen this kind of growth happen on accident (and I know my play experience is limited).

I wager if you asked those players "So, how has your character changed since we started play six months ago?" most would have a clear answer for you. The problem is that they can't express that answer through play unless a dramatic situation arises that permits them to do that. I bet you've been in the same spot too, sitting on a great character revelation and the GM just won't put you somewhere to execute it. I know I have.<br/><br/>Some games put situation development in the hands of the same players as the characters in order to handle this - otherse use or systematize GM situation-making to handle this. I've had good luck by saying "Hey, GM, my guy has changed in this way, why don't we cook up a situation in play to address that?"  Most say "Hell yes, great idea!" and go from there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288451/#Comment_288451" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T07:41:17+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  7:41AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2010 7:41AM by ChristopherWeeks.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: masqueradeball</cite>So what I'm getting is that most players allow the game system to determine how much they plan ahead with their characters?</blockquote>Yeah!  I do.  And I'd recommend it as a generally superior approach.  I mean, do what pleases you -- but in general, I'd rather do what the game I'm playing is good at.  If I don't <i>like</i> whatever that is, then I'm playing the wrong game.  If the character arc is really important to you, find games that embrace or require that and play those.  Either I'm not good enough at it or life's too short to shoehorn my preferences into a game that doesn't support what I want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288461/#Comment_288461" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T08:44:19+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  8:44AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD: I agree, it would be hard to gauge whether or not the character changed. Maybe its the nebulousness of the whole thing that bugs me. I want to be able to at least talk about these things at a table level, both as a player and as a GM. Having that sense that whats happening is 'good' fiction is important to me (sort of).<br/>\n<br/>\nChristopher: Once again, general agreement on my part, but this time with an amendment, D&amp;D doesn't not support what I want. If I look at the various editions I've played, I would say that neither the Rules Cyclopedia or 2e address it (or at least not directly) but they reference that these kinds of arcs would occur by citing or emulating various fictional sources (Howard, Tolkein, etc...). I think the expectation is that the players will provide the techniques to transform these games into fiction that they enjoy, and that rules are there to cover a subset of what occurs in the fiction. It seems almost impossible for the designers to think in terms of character arcs or dramatic arcs as things that the game would address. I want more modern game experiences (and I'm taking steps to procure them) but in games of the era I don't think there's an inappropriate way to approach story, because there's an implied focus on a story that the rules do not tell you how to create, with the implication being that its up to the group how to make that part of the game work.<br/>\n<br/>\nOut of the two modes of play offered in 3e (Kick Down the Door and Deep Immersion) I might note that neither of these is suited to having character arcs, so there I would be shoehorning.<br/>\n<br/>\nI might also note that in terms of play style, my current go to place of top-down thinking about character is actually reactionary. When I first stepped over from ST/GM to playing a character, I almost always created characters that felt real to me and did my best to play with a strong almost method acting approach (I tried to feel what my character felt and to act as my character would act). I stopped this when it turned out that no one else wanted to bring that level of emotionality into play. It seemed that though people appreciated the idea of identifying with character, they didn't appreciate some of the results, which is that 'character first' means 'story second.' So I changed, only to encounter a different problem, which is what is meant by story, really. To me a good story is typified by the way a character changes over time. Other players focused more on a sort of narrative cogency (things kept happening, event A flowed into event B, etc... with little in the way of gaps or asides). Thats what 'good story' constituted for them in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288473/#Comment_288473" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T09:34:36+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  9:34AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not being able to discuss your preferences or how the game is going openly, at the table level, is to me a huge red flag.

It seems to me that many RPG players believe that plot discovery is the primary way to enjoy stories, so they object to any pre-planned plotting. The "intensely know a particular character, then see what happens when they bump up against other characters" seems to be a popular approach to story games. I think there's a lot of space to explore in the "know the plot, discover who the characters are and how they get there" approach that hasn't been explored yet (it's something I'm trying to make work in <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/final-hour-of-a-storied-age/" rel="nofollow">the game I'm designing</a>).

The tjhree most slam-bang obvious, it's-hard-to-mess-this-up ones off the top of my head are Dogs in the Vineyard, My Life With Master, and the Rustbelt. The Rustbelt is especially innovative in that it pays special attention to the character's internal makeup and how it changes to it due to outside events. Not as mandated effects as in MLWM (e.g. Self-Loathing goes up when you do X and Y), but as a set of choices triggered by certain events (e.g. when you act counter to your Faith, either feel bad about it and take on Woe, or lose the Faith, or feel good about it and take on Vice &amp; lose the Faith). The way that the game is structured means that these kinds of things <i>have</i> to happen, and the way that resolution works means that the players <i>have</i> to pay attention to this stuff, mean what they write down, and approach their characters like <i>characters</i> with thoughts and beliefs etc., rather than pawns. (Seriously, it all but precludes pawn stance. I'm proud of it.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: masqueradeball</cite>But how do I make Frodo happen, or Luke or Harry Potter or any other major fantasy character come to life without giving him the right trajectory?</blockquote>\nYou design a game that does it <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>But to look at the issue pragmatically: defining a character's arc means defining the Conflict that they face, how they deal with that conflict, <i>and</i> how it resolves. <i>Somebody</i> has to have authority over these different things. Call of Cthulhu works because it punts all of those straight to the game itself: it's expected that you'll make characters in X range that handle problems in Y ways, and they'll face the Outer Dark and lose their minds over it eventually. Your typical railroading GM also handles all of those things in getting his story to work (but, hey, it's only railroading if the players resent it). In The Rustbelt (and Sorcerer, Trollbabe, and Dogs) you only define how you deal with the conflict (you might have a bit of input on the conflict itself, but that's primarily the GM's territory), and then how it resolves is filtered heavily through system techniques that cause unanticipated outcomes and prompt decision points that nobody could have seen coming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288496/#Comment_288496" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T11:01:31+00:00" title="August 24, 2010 11:01AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think I'm more of define character change, and less plot.

However, as you (masq) note, there are characters that don't change much over the course of a story.  Here I point to episodic television, soap operas and comic books, in which the needs of continuity dictate that characters mustn't drastically change except at particular structural points (season finales, a change of actor, a double-sized annual crossover.)  Even in these situations the plot still is a way to show off different parts, or emphasize different parts, of characters.  Similarly, character traits simply don't exist independent of a dramatic situation in which they are placed at risk, in doubt, or under fire.

I think it should be okay for people to bring these kind of considerations to the table. I want to grow like this, I want to fail like this, I want to... these things sometimes make the character. I don't think that having these lynch pins is the problem. I think there are two problems: expectations about where these lynch pins are allowed to go and having too many pins so that your character is unable to be molded around the other player's creations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288592/#Comment_288592" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T19:20:04+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  7:20PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2010 7:20PM by johnzo.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: masqueradeball</cite>I think it should be okay for people to bring these kind of considerations to the table</blockquote>\nThere are lots of games that directly address these kinds of considerations.  Mouse Guard has Beliefs, Instincts, and Goals.  PTA has Issues.  Riddle of Steel has Spiritual Attributes.  Full Light, Full Steam has Batteries.  The Shadow of Yesterday has Keys.<br/><br/>All of these mechanics (which are broadly called 'flags') provide guidance to the table about what kind of story elements the player wants to address, and many of them also reward the player with extra in-game effectiveness when they are engaged.  What they fail to do is to dictate any kind of outcome or destiny to that engagement.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: masqueradeball</cite>But if Luke has to confront his father to grow, and he doesn't get to do that, than Luke isn't played, not really, not in my opinio</blockquote>\nDenial or postponement of a goal or impulse can be just as powerful as its achievement.  Consider Luke Skywalker as a Mouse Guard character:<br/><br/>Goal: Become a Jedi Knight like my father.<br/>Belief: My strength flows from my friends.<br/><br/>Empire Strikes Back, being awesome, puts these two impulses directly at odds.  Say we have an alt-universe ESB in which Luke is more beholden to his Goal than his Belief, which leads him to make the opposite choice that he does in our universe -- he obeys Yoda and doesn't interrupt his training to go off and confront Vader and rescue Han and Leia.  That's arguably a more interesting fictional Luke than the one we got in ESB, and certainly you can't say that alt-Luke hasn't changed as a result of that decision.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288597/#Comment_288597" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T19:52:53+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  7:52PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2010 8:06PM by masqueradeball.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I know, outcomes can be tricky and the traditional approach can be up in the air, and I understand flags. The thing is I think its almost less important to agree upon things defined by the mechanics, because you have the "its on my character sheet" to back you up. What about when you don't have mechanics to resort to. Also, postponement and conflict are part and parcel with the whole plot expectation... its the Hero Cycle, the Road of Trials is something I want when I want to play a hero like Luke, those tough choices, etc... Its not dictating a type of play, or saying THIS MUST HAPPEN OR ELSE or anything like that, its just that when I buy into seeing a change made, I want that to happen. I don't see how its fundamentally any different than any other expectation that I might have in play.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd sorry but I feel that I have to go there: CA... focusing on the conflict is  Nar while focusing on the journey to where I want to go is Sim. Different agendas. What do I want to address? I normally want to address the journey. The internal conflicts going on in my character are just another obstacle/aspect of the environment along the way. I don't know if its conflicting CA that causing the problems in the game. I hasten to add that if these categories aren't helpful to you, forget I said anything, I don't wanna argue theory I just thought it might clarify what my thoughts are on the subject.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288606/#Comment_288606" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T21:14:28+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  9:14PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: masqueradeball</cite>What about when you don't have mechanics to resort to.</blockquote>\nWhen you don't have mechanics to resort to, guess what, you don't get the kind of play you describe yourself as wanting here.

A group of people who want the kind of play you describe can (and will!) make it happen, even if the game they're playing has no specific rules to address it.  Likewise, a group of people who explicitly do not want that kind of play will find ways to avoid or minimize it, even if there are plenty of important rules involving it.<br/><br/>So switching game systems isn't necessarily a magic bullet; if they genuinely do not want what you want, you're still going to be left looking for another group more in tune with your tastes.  Still, trying out a game with rules that support your chosen playstyle makes it much, much easier to tell whether your current group is open to that playstyle, so it's worth a shot.  And if they try it and like it, you're not going to be locked into playing only games with rules to support that style, because you guys can fill in the gaps yourselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288617/#Comment_288617" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T23:41:54+00:00" title="August 24, 2010 11:41PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thats why I said mechanics and not System, I think social dynamics/agreements could replace game mechanics to make sure these things happen.
