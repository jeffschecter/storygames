If it isn't Andy can feel free to move me around appropriately.<br/><br/>I've always liked the basic dice mechanic from Alternity.  I wasn't incredibly thrilled with the rest of the system; although, for a kind of generic system it wasn't bad.  I certainly liked it better than some other generic systems.  In any event, I've been working on my own system utilizing the core mechanic from Alternity and I've started posting my work <a href="http://kairoscreative.wordpress.com/tag/current-projects/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  If anyone is interested and would like to comment on the project, head on over there and say howdy.  <br/><br/>Designing a system is a big project.  Actually publishing that system at some point is even bigger.  I'd be very interested in having a collaborator or two on the project .  If you are interested in that let me know also and we can talk about it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
