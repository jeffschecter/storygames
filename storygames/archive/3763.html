Unfortunately, I failed Fred by misreading social cues. I felt like I wasn't making it come alive for Jeff (not Kryos-Jeff) and Bret. It turns out that it was probably just due to my misreading them due to my unfamiliarity with them in a gaming context.<br/><br/>The characters, then a brief on the scenes in the following posts.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84329/#Comment_84329" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T12:35:41+00:00" title="July 31, 2007 12:35PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 31, 2007 12:58PM by Robert_Bohl.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jack / Wilkins by Bret<br/><br/>AGENT: Intimacy 2: Distant father (checked).

She seduces him to get the goods, but she gets a bad rep out of it.<br/><br/>Billie has just finished servicing Brisco on the anniversary of his divorce, gets under his skin by needling him for information about his bummed-out-demeanor, pokes around in his laptop (which winds up in evidence) and sees something about "keys" on it. Brisco beats her with it.<br/><br/>The bleed is located as "Bottom bitch," which spawns in Kendrick: "Hit first."<br/><br/>Jack / Wilkins's flashbacks:<br/><br/>Jack is cornered by Taylor when Jack is 12 years old. Taylor, wearing a trenchcoat, is demanding Jack's shoes. Jack doesn't want to give them up because his sister got them for him. Taylor pulls a knife and cuts Jack's cheek. Rob provides a contribution die to Jack, including the constraint that Kendrick is revealed as his sister.<br/><br/>Wilkins's dad, dressed in a trenchcoat, is revealed as a coder on PALACE who is kind of a dick. The conflict revolves around why he's a jerk to Wilkins and we learn that he puts career in front of family. Kendrick, seeing Wilkins shamed in front of his dad, finds her calculated sexual manipulation of before turn into an actual romantic attraction.<br/><br/>The bleed is located as "Afraid of knives" and produces in Wilkins "The Butcher of Carmichael case".<br/><br/>Brisco / Taylor's flashbacks:<br/><br/>Taylor analyzes Billie--dressed in lingerie--as she is held as a material witness after her beating. She gets him to reveal that he watched his parents die, and this allowed him to get his life in order.<br/><br/>Brisco relives his divorce. Jack takes the stand to present photographs he took of Brisco's wife having sex with a strange man while dressed in lingerie. This gets him the divorce but he goes a bit batshit and flips over the table he's seated at, but the divorce frees him to be the hacker he was meant to be.<br/><br/>The bleed is located as "Orphan" and creates in Brisco "Hatred of the system."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84338/#Comment_84338" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T13:02:42+00:00" title="July 31, 2007  1:02PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some issues that arose:<br/><br/>Someone was a bit resistant to the "open questions" thing that <i>Schizonauts</i> asks.

I really don't think this is an actual issue - maybe it is just as narratively open, but it's not as interesting a question. It seems pretty clear to me that the former leads to different types of answers than the latter. This mysterious someone was just nitpicking.

The freedom is certainly there.  The *sense* however that you're *allowed* to exercise that freedom is far more variable.  I think that closed questions tend to put blinders on people without them realizing it.  That's why I encourage open questions in Schizonauts rather than closed questions; the sin committed by closed questions is the degree to which they give the impression that certain outcomes are preordained.  I want a more even playing field for the range of answers.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>For example, you've got a gun pointed at the head of the bank teller. You don't ask "Do I shoot the guy?" you ask "What happens with the gun?"</blockquote>\nDo I shoot the guy is actually a borderline question; you could see it as either one.  A better example of closed options, as I think about it, is in classic stakes-setting: "Okay, if you win, the bank teller gets shot, if I win, *you* get shot" or whatever.  It's determining what happens before the authority to determine what happens is determined.  Closed questions skirt the edge of that, and that's something I specifically didn't want in how Schizonauts plays out.<br/><br/>But let's go back to the borderline, "Do I shoot the guy?" Here's the problem: the answer to that is "Yes" or "No", the way it's phrased.  Yes, you shoot the guy.  No, you don't shoot the guy.  Those sorts of responses are more heavily weighted, even if it gets storytold as "Well, you shoot at him, but the bullet deflects off the glass at lodges in your shoulder." or whatever.    I personally feel when the question is instead "What happens with the gun?" people are more willing to go interesting places with it -- it's more likely to trigger some free-associations which are thematically appropriate for the game.  I might look at "What happens with the gun?" and think, "You mean after the bank teller gets shot?  Well, I think it gets lost from the evidence room and the shooter ends up walking thanks to a mistrial."   I'm not sure I'd ever get there from "Do I shoot the guy?"\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>We ran into a situation once where I opened a scene with a violence trigger but then narratively there was no room for it. We got a little stuck. Fred suggests we try hard to drive to that point.</blockquote>\nYeah, the language of the text needs to be a bit more on point about telling people, "When you choose a trigger of a particular type, the scene itself is predisposed towards that sort of resolution, colored by whatever the visitor is bringing in as well."  So Violence triggers are scenes involving violence, Intimacy and Knowledge having similar behaviors.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
