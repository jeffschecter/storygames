I might be a bit biased since I wrote it in the first place, but I think it has stood the test of time. Today, seven years after the first release, I still think it is a brilliant game.  It is a GM-less and competitive RPG about people in a future described in shared world building, playable in about 4 hours.  <br/><br/>I wanted the game to be prettier so I pulled Claudia Cangini in to help, and she made the gorgeous cover illustration that you can see above.  The crowdfunding is to made to pay Claudia to make some pictures to go on the inside of the book as well.<br/><br/>Second, I'm running a crowdfunding for a new edition of my game, directly on DriveThruRPG.  No Kickstarter, no Indiegogo, just a shop entry with a PWYW title and a blurb about why it would be nice if you bought the game. Four days into the campaign I'm still finding my way forward, the page has been updated a couple of times. I've talked with gamers around the world about the game and the project.<br/><br/>If you'd like to discuss the first or the second topic I'm here.<br/><br/>The current status is : The first picture goal has been reached.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457936/#Comment_457936" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-07T18:07:26+00:00" title="November  7, 2016  6:07PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wihelm, will this be available in book form?

Maybe the interest in the printing of the book could help cover the art as well? Maybe you could even see if people were willing to pay the extra cost of including the art in the printed version?

At last.<br/><br/>Some random thoughts on the whole 5 month project.<br/><br/>- Crowdfunding on DriveThruRPG is convenient.  But it has two major drawbacks.  DriveThru takes a larger cut, 30% over Kickstarter's 10%.  And since it does not appear on the Kickstarter site it won't benefit from the marketing stuff of being there.<br/><br/>- I bloody hate being accountable on gaming projects.  This illustrated edition is gorgeous. But once I had that bag of money every step of the way felt like a chore rather than a fun hobby game design stuff usually does.<br/><br/>- I don't like working with artists.  Claudia did excellently, no complaints there (and all previous collaborations with artists have been fine as well). It is all on my end, but I wish I had the patience to learn how to draw myself.<br/><br/>- Once I had the cover illustration i let the scope get out of hand.  It was AMAZING and I wanted the whole game to look like that, no matter what the backers came up with.  In the end I matched the backers' contributions 1-to-1 to be able to have the illustrations in color, rather than the B/W sketches I had planned on when I first started.  So the project is deep in the red, but if Wilhelm's Games performs like previous years I'll be in the black again by New Year.  It is good that I don't run an actual company. :-)<br/><br/>- I promised to make a dead-tree edition as well. It is not a lot of additional work to get it there. But I'll leave it aside for now, it is good that I didn't promise a simultaneous release.<br/><br/>- I hate every moment I have to spend in the DriveThru publisher's interface.  It is the place to be if one wants to sell PDF games, just as Lulu is the place to be for Print-on-Demand, but damn. That interface is a mess.<br/><br/>For now I'll focus on this project for a while, and it won't be crowdfunded.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i65.tinypic.com/28apy1j.png"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461324/#Comment_461324" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-23T20:35:35+00:00" title="March 23, 2017  8:35PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            POD book is now available through LULU.<br/><a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/wilhelm-person/while-the-world-ends/paperback/product-23102594.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.lulu.com/shop/wilhelm-person/while-the-world-ends/paperback/product-23102594.html</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
