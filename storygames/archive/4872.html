I first saw it on the Forge and it changed the way I design and run games, and I think it's been the driving force behind everything good about the Indie movement - sure there's been a host of other theoretical advances but that central principle has been the driving factor that's pushed it all along and made it great.<br/><br/>And now it's infected the big beast of the industry.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh" title="jdrakeh"><img alt="jdrakeh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/909/nZA3BEK4G6OHW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh">jdrakeh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109347/#Comment_109347" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-23T07:07:58+00:00" title="November 23, 2007  7:07AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You may have first <i>seen</i> this approach to design being implemented at the Forge but, rest assured, it existed before then.

It makes such perfect sense for D&amp;D, way more than the crammed-to-the-gills settings that are so common. I mean, it's basically <i>Keep on the Borderlands</i>.<br/><br/>It's also a great publishing strategy, assuming the "one setting a year" WotC announced really means "one point of light a year." As long as every "setting" is surrounded by "Here be dragons" on their maps, nothing prevent all the "points" from popping up in the same campaign world. Ergo, setting fandom doesn't have to splinter the consumer base.<br/><br/>I'm way excited for 4e.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109366/#Comment_109366" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-23T10:06:10+00:00" title="November 23, 2007 10:06AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jack Aidley</cite>Call it what you will; blame it on who you like - it's still a better way to design games.</blockquote>\nSure it is, assuming you have an interest in consuming that packaged play experience, by being a Striker or Controller or whatnot. As opposed to being, say, a Fighter.<br/><br/>"Points of light" is a reason to stock every corner with monsters and crap -- a justification for crammed to the gills. Nobody's going to change the Realms for the sake of D&amp;D because the Realms' fiction properties are more valuable than D&amp;D. The central paradigm shift is the assumption of MMO-style tactical roles.

The tabletop form has its own unique aspects that also need support, and one of them is the way characters often develop against the assumed tactical role.

Also, most of the people they killed didn't even have names; if you kill a main character, that's a big deal, but if when you wipe out 75% of your population in a fantasy setting, that's just background filler. You can repopulate the world just as easily.

Perhaps you take a different view, and if so I'd be happy to hear it.<br/><br/>3e is that. Looking globally at the D&amp;D concept, not so much. In it, D&amp;D is game where social role and abilities are fuzzily connected through classes and protagonists play through a series of core stories.\n<blockquote>But the most fundamental decision when playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons has always been: "What class will I play?" and, aside from a little bit of customization, a "class" has always been a constrained tactical function.  Players can undermine, embellish, or modify this tactical function through their imaginations -- "My fighter is afraid of blood, look I'm running away DM, so what happens now?" -- but the core tactical function is there.  But that choice of classes has<i>always</i>been a functional, and to some extent an imaginative, constraint.</blockquote>\nSure -- but before 3e, there wasn't much tactical specificity. After 3e, the specificity was loaded on the classes, especially the fighter, which ended up bein as close to a point-buy character as you were going to get but sure supported lots of roles other than defending spellcasters.\n<blockquote>It sounds like what's happened is that in the prospective version, the designers said, "Hey, what<i>are</i>these tactical functions, really?" and reconceptualized a few of the classes according to a view of resource-managed small-squad combat.  The result, one hopes, is a tactical wargame that makes small squad teamwork (slightly) more intuitive, so that the war-game part of D&amp;D gels better.</blockquote>\n I've never seen defending spellcasters as being that big a deal in any game. In virtually every D&amp;D game I've seen or played, fighters were offensive combatants because it's almost always in the party's interest to attack and defeat enemies quickly, since character resources regenerate, and players almost always have the power to choose character rest periods. That, and damage spoiling spells is one of the most commonly ignored rules in the game. <br/><br/>It sounds to me, frankly, that fighters were simply shoehorned into that role because they needed a class to do that to fit their conceptual framework.\n<blockquote>Nobody's taking your RP away.  It's where it's always been: hiding out in Chapter 7 with the alignments and height/weight tables.</blockquote>\nYour contempt for D&amp;D as a game where roleplaying takes front and center really isn't the issue.\n<blockquote>You're absolutely right - in contrast to the prior versions of D&amp;D, where the Fighter was a dude in heavy armor with a sword, who started out pretty bad-ass but by the end of the game only functions as a body-guard for the heavy artillery.</blockquote>\nSee above. I've almost never seen anybody play a fighter as a spellcaster guard for any length of time.<br/><br/>If WotC wants to learn from MMOs, they should watch the Leroy Jenkins vid about a thousand times and ask themselves why he's having a metric fuckton more fun than anybody else and why somebody who didn't cleave to their Assigned Tactical Role is the main character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109465/#Comment_109465" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-24T09:57:04+00:00" title="November 24, 2007  9:57AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 24, 2007 10:02AM by James_Nostack.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Malcolm, I wrote a long-winded reply until I realized that I shouldn't be arguing about Dungeons &amp; Dragons, because it looks like we're mostly arguing about personal experiences.  But I did want to differ with you here:\n<blockquote>If WotC wants to learn from MMOs, they should watch the Leroy Jenkins vid about a thousand times and ask themselves why he's having a metric fuckton more fun than anybody else and why somebody who didn't cleave to their Assigned Tactical Role is the main character.</blockquote>\nI think what the Leroy Jenkins joke is all about, is wanting to actually get out there and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">play the game</span>, rather than spending a zillion hours with strategy.  It sounds like what the D&amp;D designers did was say, "You know, combat's really fun but super complicated under 3.X.  What can we do, to eliminate the tedious strategic calculations?  Let's make clear what everyone's supposed to do, and let's give them resources to keep doing it reliably, so players don't get impatient, bored and disapoointed."  Whether the designers hit that mark to anyone's satisfaction is anyone's guess, but it sounds like that's what they're trying to do.  Without seeing the game, I have a hard time seeing how that goal limits your ability to imagine your character's non-combat role any way you like, but who knows?<br/><br/>PS.  I don't have contempt for D&amp;D.  It's one of my favorite games.  But it's not all things to all men, and its design impacts the play experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109482/#Comment_109482" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-24T13:24:52+00:00" title="November 24, 2007  1:24PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's worth noting that, having followed all the 4e preview news pretty closely, I haven't seen anything to indicate that the 4e fighter is going to be more restricted in any way.

I was shocked when 3rd Ed came. After I actually gave it a look, I started digging it.<br/><br/>I know most people complain about how it was all about Power Playing. And I agree that the rules can encourage that style of playing, but that depends too much on the playing style of the DM and the players. (A Storyteller kind of player is not suddenly going to become a Power Player just for playing DnD.) And I actually loved the way the character customization was enhanced. That actually got to be a role playing tool for me.<br/><br/>When 3.5 Ed came, I was actually a supporter. Having played 3rd for some time then, I knew there were some blurry spots that could be improved. And when it came out, I wasn't disappointed. I did feel it was the same old DnD, polished and enhanced. Ok, maybe not "old school" DnD, but it didn't compromise anything important (storywise or role-playing relevant).<br/><br/>I have to confess. I <b>do</b> have some mixed feelings about 4th Ed. As far as I have seen, I feel that the Power Playing issue was augmented, not fixed. No to say that they are trying to make the game more smooth and enjoyable. I totally understand, and even support some of the changes. The most hated part in any campaign I have ever played or mastered is that of those hateful low levels, when the players can't do much, thus getting kind of frustrated and bored. And they seem to be addressing that sort of problems.<br/><br/>I haven't played any MMO so far. By choice, rather than by being unable to do so. But I see MMOs as The Power Playing games. And being a Storyteller myself... Lets just say they are not really my thing.<br/><br/>That is precisely the main advantage between DnD and any MMO out there. No matter how many overly powerful and marketable thing they put into it, they will never be able to substitute those amazing hours of In-Character arguments, story development and plot enjoyment.<br/><br/>And that is why I'm willing to give the 4th Ed a try.<br/><br/>Who knows? I might be pleased once I actually play it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124806/#Comment_124806" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-06T13:04:05+00:00" title="February  6, 2008  1:04PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Uhm...

You sort of end up with a conflict between the story elements and the way the rules give traction to task resolution focused play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_132840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132840/#Comment_132840" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T22:48:29+00:00" title="March  5, 2008 10:48PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=382910" rel="nofollow">The non-combat encounter rules for 4th edition</a> seem to be something very cool, and way more story-gamey than you would expect from D&amp;D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132856/#Comment_132856" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-06T01:28:29+00:00" title="March  6, 2008  1:28AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2008 1:29AM by John_Harper.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The D&amp;D4 developers have been playing Nine Worlds, SotC, Agon, and Burning Whatever for a while now.

Tweet. Jonathan "Over the Edge" Tweet. "Indie influence?" Well, yes, of course. He was *indeed* the man who got us started. Tweet doesn't need anyone to tell him how to make paradigm changes in RPGs. Recall that he made fewer changes than he would with third edition precisely because he was told that he had to keep certain things the same, in order to make sure that the brand stayed recognizable. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes he have those limits this time? Seeing as they feel that they're going up against a far bigger giant in WOW? <br/>\n<br/>\nLooking forward to seeing what he does with the "non-combat" stuff. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
