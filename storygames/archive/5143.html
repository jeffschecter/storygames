There's a game I've been messing around with that does something similar, except with the core stats rather than the niftycool doodads. There's a gift die mechanic pretty much lifted straight out of The Shadow of Yesterday, see, except you put a little check mark by a stat when someone gives you a gift die for a test of that stat. When you rack up enough checks, the stat advances. Haven't playtested it though.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also reminds me a bit of how you gain and lose Traits in Burning Wheel, which is to say, everyone votes on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the effects you'd see in E6, I think, is characters becoming less build-y. Like, less focused to take advantage of specific rules structures, more tangled and sprawling. Maybe you'd see a bit more investment from the players in PCs other than their own. It's also possible that people could end up unhappy with the choices that others give to them... it might be good to leave some avenues of the character's growth up to its owner, and others up to the rest of the group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116088/#Comment_116088" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-23T10:40:26+00:00" title="December 23, 2007 10:40AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Burning Wheel does a little something like this with group voting on each character's Traits.

Without level advancement, feats are now the definition of character development in system and player is not being allowed to define their character except "through a mirror darkly" via others' perceptions of play which itself is subject to the GM's control of scenes and random die variations.  <br><br>The uncertainty of this medium for communicating player desires for advancement then becomes an issue.  It's not as simple as "you want X, you do Y and if successful you get X".<br/><br/>Social dynamics and different agendas of players may come into play still as much as ever or more.  Much depends on whether IC or OOC "chatter" is expected to factor into matters.  The rogue waxes eloquent "in play" about how he would love to hamstring and slow down foes when striking with sneak ~ others get the hint regarding the feat to do that.  Another PC ends up with Craft Magic Arms and Armour because the players of other PC's want magic arms.<br/><br/>Dissonance of play styles etc. may be aggravated (no table really has everyone with same tastes, to some extent you live with fact someone next to you design and player characters differently than you with the thought, "well that's their character, I'll design and play mine my way.").<br/><br/>I think there are really two issues here:<br/><br/>- 1st is making feat selection flow from events in play (the long time bugaboo of level based systems being dissonance of play and specific advancement results compared to "skill check" systems like BW or dare I say it old Chaosium systems did - with "advance what you use")'<br/>- 2nd is putting that "from play events" selection under group authority (I can't think of a PC-based game example of the group authority issue here, I can think of "group veto" approaches [yes BW traits] but not "group authoring").<br/><br/>It might be useful to consider the issues of each.  I would favour "advance what you use" (choose feats that matter) over "group interpretation of what matters for each player".  You can make this more immediate by giving the feat slot but not having the feat chosen until it would matter and then letting it be chosen immediatley (e.g., the cleric with empty slot may end up taking Spell Penetration if their spell fails to beat SR by 1 or might instead end up taking Extra Turning if they run out of uses and undead are still coming - in each case effect is immediate, spell did beat SR, cleric has the extra uses of Turn/Rebuke this day).  Player can still "have that in mind" but choice isn't locked down until it would matter in play (which means player doesn't lose anything as if it never matters they lost nothing in play).<br/><br/>Rob                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116102/#Comment_116102" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-23T13:00:13+00:00" title="December 23, 2007  1:00PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jeph</cite>One of the effects you'd see in E6, I think, is characters becoming less build-y.</blockquote>That's basically what I'd like to accomplish - if your character had a great fishing scene with another character, getting Skill Focus (Fishing) is cool but not build-relevant.<br/><br/>But I think Rob's right with this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valvorik</cite>Players may not react well to "external shaping" of character though an uncertain medium.</blockquote>Which I'm sure is 100% right.

Don't just "show the DM what you've been emailing privately about in terms of character development", show everyone, act it up a bit more when your character is doing the stuff you intend to build up more with feats.<br/><br/>Can you eloborate "earning it"?  <br/><br/>Do you mean in sense of "you can opt to get Improved Critical if you scored a critical using that weapon or if your blow with that weapon killed a foe" - the narrative play created says "Zamora runs the pirate through with her rapier and he drops dead" (scored a crit and rolled well), now meaning that to facilitate reincorporation of Zamora being effective and deadly with her rapier in a story-game sense (her most notable actions are not a collection of dice flukes, there is pattern), her player can now take any feat for her that makes that likely in future (Weapon Focus, Specialization, Improve Crit etc. assuming other qualifications met).<br/><br/>Or do you mean "you tried to be effective that way and weren't", that earns the ability to increase your effectiveness (after all narratives are full of tried, tried, tried, then succeeded).  "Zamora misses the pirate with her blade and then hits but fails by narrow margin to confirm critical, suffering his blows in return in meantime and being sorely wounded", so now Zamora can say "I learned about handling rapier" and can take any rapier-use enhancing feat?<br/><br/>If you want to "influence play" you only need to make the qualification work on "try" (2nd option) not "did".<br/><br/>Combining them "tried but didn't succeed" is something rest of table can veto (it doesn't make sense to table that she would ever be good at that), whereas "success" is something table can't veto (look, she took him down with her sword, as unlikely as it seems, it should be more likely that she can do it again).  This creates a "player-only" zone to satisfy those needs as well as encouraging "demonstrating action to table".<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_116109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116109/#Comment_116109" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-23T13:41:03+00:00" title="December 23, 2007  1:41PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valvorik</cite>Can you eloborate "earning it"?</blockquote>I'm looking for "this came up in a scene" - so if you want to take Whirlwind Attack you better have been fighting multiple foes in some scene.

The alternatives give more cues to roleplaying and suggest stories and obstacles for GM to create.<br/><br/>You can impose on Players an obligation to add such scripting to their feats.  The feats still exist as the technical substrata. Whenever, in play, the feat matters (e.g., you hit by one) the player declares it, "I would have missed but recall my grandfather's teaching" etc.<br/><br/>The same weapon focus bonus can come from \u201cI killed my first man with a longsword\u201d, \u201cLongswords are sacred to my god\u201d, \u201cThe longsword is the mark of a true warrior\u201d.

If you want to do this every session, it sounds like you need a short in game solution. A vote may not be the way to go. You probably need something easily communicated without an actual discussion. In <a href="http://nerdnyc.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=32995" rel="nofollow">playstorming Soap Opera Violence</a>, we've been using different group inspired character growth techniques. It's a very different setup than 3.5 but hopefully it may act as fuel for your own inspiration. <br/><br/>In SOV, we have 2 types of scenes. Getting Over and Fighting. Getting Over means investing the audience (the other players) in your character. To get over, you narrate a scene, place your character sheet in the center of the table, everyone else grabs a d6, counts to 3, and then places a d6 on the trait they felt invested in or place a d6 on an empty trait slot. If placed on an empty trait slot, they fill in a new trait. Multiple d6s can be placed on the same trait.<br/><br/>You could do something similar with feats. Breakdown feats into general categories that can be represented on a single sheet of paper. After a predetermined interval (scenes, encounters, sessions), every player places a marker on the category they felt best represented by the actions of the character in question. This could generate currency with which the character's player may spend to purchase a feat in those specific categories. <br/><br/>Rock,<br/>John                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116181/#Comment_116181" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-24T09:19:53+00:00" title="December 24, 2007  9:19AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, hey, there's an idea.

When a player spends an action point to use a feat in a conflict, they write it down next to the desire that fueled that conflict. At session's end, players express which drives pushed the game forward or generated the most excitement, and the player gets the feat attached to that drive.
