So if the book is boring, it's boring in the same way that a guitar or a box of crayons is boring... until you use your creativity and skill to do something interesting with it.<br/>If it's a toolkit, it should be called a roleplay toolkit. A game is interesting even before your creativity is applied. If it's a toolkit, there's a snake oil dishonesty in it being sold as a roleplay <i>game</i>. It'd be like selling a car mechanics toolkit as a 'game'.<br/><br/>You think it's a toolkit, I think it's supposed to be a game. It could be either, that's cool between us. But surely we'd agree that when an object is X, but sold as Y, there's dishonesty going on with the seller?<br/>Personally I see all the editions of D&amp;D as failing to be games, without considerable work added (I'd forgiven them because theres so little understanding of how to mechanically handle the SIS). I hadn't considered them just as toolkits - that could be the truth of the matter. But they are sold as roleplay <i>games</i>, not roleplay toolkits. When I thought they were trying to make games but failing out of lack of skill, I'm forgiving. But in considering that they may indeed be intended as toolkits, then it's flat dishonest to use the word 'game'. I mean dishonest not in any deep, new way - it's the same old sort of dishonesty, like if you buy something at the shop and the guy behind the counter short changes you, that dishonesty.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161057/#Comment_161057" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-06T16:42:58+00:00" title="August  6, 2008  4:42PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How so?

So I don't think the "calling them games is dishonest" thing holds any water at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nGame companies had house magazines dedicated to publishing popular variants and hacks of their lines of wargames.  Many lines of wargames were nothing more than one set of rules with a new scenario hack packaged in a new box with a new map and new counters.  If you get into the world of miniature wargames...and here I mean REAL miniatures wargames...not that Games Workshop drivel (and derivatives) you'll find that hacking together your army list, hacking together an order of battle for a particular campaign, and hacking together the proper terrain for the battlefield WAS as much a part of the game pleasure as designing a deck is for CCGs.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course D&amp;D; is a "toolkit" design...it derived from wargaming...which is the ultimate of "toolkit" designs.  The typical historical minis game out toolkits Hero by a long shot.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was the mentality of the hobby game back in the day...a much different mindset from the "open box, read 6 pages of rules, and play" mentality of most of what populates Board Game Geek these days.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I'm a fan of prefab fun...but saying that its dishonest to call some-assembly-required fun a game is pretty far stretch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog" title="Z-Dog"><img alt="Z-Dog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog">Z-Dog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161068/#Comment_161068" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-06T17:31:29+00:00" title="August  6, 2008  5:31PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, nevermind.<br>\n<br>\nBadly designed game?

Or, benefit of the doubt, perhaps they were not skilled enough and thought they had made a game as much as chess is, but actually hadn't.<br/><br/>Now, the original benchmark for what a game is, is just made up - a product of culture. Hope we all know that, or I'm going to have to iconoclast your asses at some point soon <img alt="&gt;:)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/naughty.png" title="&gt;:)"/>. But you can't use a word from that culture in a way that doesn't match the benchmark without either A: lying, or B: starting a whole new culture, and within that culture that definition is the true definition. For example, homosexual culture certainly hijacked the word 'gay' - so much so it's fairly lost it's defintion in the older culture it spawned from. Various supporters of sport hijack certain words as their codewords and become almost a secret language amongst them. New culture, new definitions. That, or just being liers for commercial gain.<br/><br/>The idea of it being a definition of a new culture thing is a concilitory suggestion, showing I'm not just here to nail D&amp;D and we can end on something other than grinding teeth. But I'd say even as a culture, it's stepping on toes - especially as its heart has always been commercial (the heart of various sports usually aren't commercial, as a counter example).<br/><br/>Or am I speaking too big and conversation should stick to small things, rather than question why it should stick to small things and suchlike? I'm not going to stay within those limmits, but I'm not going to drag anyone out of them either. I think this posts valuable, but that doesn't imply it has to be used.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_161086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161086/#Comment_161086" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-06T19:44:16+00:00" title="August  6, 2008  7:44PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 6, 2008 7:45PM by Andy.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Callan S.</cite>Well, I'm just examining if the author thinks of the product as a toolkit, but then sells it as a game.

You need to bring your interest and creativity. <br/>Or, all games are games, implying that if you're getting involved you are already bringing your interest and creativity.<br/>In both cases, the answer to both statements IMO is a kind of half-shrug, and a response of, "Oh, ok"...<br/><br/>That's just my reaction, anyway.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161087/#Comment_161087" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-06T19:46:20+00:00" title="August  6, 2008  7:46PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 6, 2008 7:48PM by Callan_S.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>If D&amp;D is a toolkit, then D&amp;D + module is a game.<br/><br/>In fact, by the definitions of this thread, Keep on the Shadowfell, is, by itself, a game.

Both had flaws, the second was better written, but  yes, both could just be played. They even layered the information sheets in the box in a way they'd facilitate faster play! That's why I want to purchase keep on the shadowfel, but I can't find it yet.\n<blockquote><blockquote><cite>Posted By: Callan S.</cite>But they are sold as roleplay<i>games</i>, not roleplay toolkits ... it's flat dishonest to use the word 'game'.</blockquote>\nWell, to be wretchedly pendantic, there is no one 4E product called the "D&amp;D Game." There are "Core Rulebooks", which are identified as being a required part of the game, and optional bits like modules and terrain and miniatures, but none are sold as "games". They are sold as rulebooks and accessories.</blockquote>\nHmm, I think you have a point - it is sold in that way, so there is a sign it's all just scattered components. I'd say it's pretty oblique and not that easy to spot, but your right, and I hadn't seen that before.<br/><br/>I guess, ironically, I mixed it up with games like the Rifts RPG, or cyberpunk RPG, or underground RPG, etc - which all call themselves roleplay <i>games</i>. D&amp;D never distinquished itself from those books very clearly, so it looked like D&amp;D was making the same claim.<br/><br/>But on the other hand, as you say "There are "Core Rulebooks", which are identified as being a required part of the <b>game</b>". It does refer to there being a game, quite alot. A game...someplace...somewhere. They just don't happen to sell it...ever! <img alt="&gt;:)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/naughty.png" title="&gt;:)"/> Just components of it. Actually, that'd tie in with Ron Edwards 'cargo cult/people only own fragments' history of D&amp;D too...hmm, really interesting!<br/><br/>You might think it was pedantic, but it made a strong point. Thanks! Wouldn't have seen it without you, perhaps!<br/><br/>I think my post to Ralph is still applicable, but the new culture part is more likely than the lier part, as a quick estimate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_161089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161089/#Comment_161089" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-06T20:26:59+00:00" title="August  6, 2008  8:26PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy, when you buy an art kit, it sits there being an art kit.<br/><br/>When you buy a yoga DVD, it sits there being a yoga DVD.<br/><br/>When you buy a guitar, it sits there being a guitar.<br/><br/>They all sit there being what they are named.

There is no way of determining this without interrogating the author. Anything else is speculation. <br/>In a purely hypothetical universe in which the product is sold as a game, there are only a few outcomes anyway: <br/><br/>1. The author believes it's a game (and Callan does not) and sells the product as a game. Callan is upset that the author is stupid.<br/><br/>2. The author believes it's a game (and Callan agrees) and sells the product as a game. Callan enjoys or does not enjoy the game on its own merits.<br/><br/>3. The author does not believe the product is a game (and Callan agrees), but sells the product as a game. The author has engaged in "false advertising" and Callan is upset that the author is a liar/con-artist.<br/><br/>4. The author does not believe the product is a game (and Callan thinks it IS a game), but sells the product as a game.

There is no way of determining this without interrogating the author. Anything else is speculation.</blockquote>\nWe could also post leaked company memos or other documentation that would shed light on the internal beliefs of the game's various contributors, but this is essentially correct. Others may, of course, continue to have discussions on topics that they make up out of whole cloth upon entering the thread, and we may once again chew upon the hoary chestnut of "what is a game," but that's not germane to the original topic. <br/><br/>Now to add something to the original topic: Mike Mearls, to grab a random subject, has a <a href="http://www.pen-paper.net/rpgdb.php?op=showbook&amp;bookid=4915" rel="nofollow">substantial</a> <a href="http://www.pen-paper.net/rpgdb.php?op=showbook&amp;bookid=5235" rel="nofollow">history</a> of working on <a href="http://www.pen-paper.net/rpgdb.php?op=showbook&amp;bookid=4805" rel="nofollow">unpolished material.</a> Thus, there is a significant likelihood that the product sitting on the shelf is, for his part, the most recent draft he was working on rather than a "gold release." As a result, I would speculate that he believes the product is whatever he claims it to be, but this properly refers to the platonic ideal of the product <i>in his head and still being made</i> rather than what's actually on the shelf. I speculate that he probably believes he delivered the thing he said he was going to deliver. Note that in a company as big as WotC, what he was hired to make and what the marketing dept. sells it as need not have anything more than rudimentary correlation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_161180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161180/#Comment_161180" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-07T10:22:39+00:00" title="August  7, 2008 10:22AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 7, 2008 10:23AM by Eric.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Quintin Stone</cite>Didn't we have an entire thread discussing that there's no cut-and-dried definition of the term "game"?

The definition doesn't actually matter - it's the difference between definitions that matters - what they'd call it, and what they call it when they sell it to you. If those two things are different, it's dishonesty. (Here's an example that'll confuse the thread no doubt: If a guy goes to sell me a rolex, which he thinks is fake but is actually the real deal, and sells it to me as a real deal, he's being dishonest. Because he wanted me to buy a fake rolex but make me think it's real. That's dishonest - even as he (accidentally) sells a genuine rolex to me. Yes, honesty isn't actually related to the goods in question, only the intent involved. If ya shoot me and you didn't know I'm invulnerable to bullets, that's still attempted murder even though I'm not even scratched <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I could go on, but I'm abusing brackets now!)<br/><br/><br/>Justin has good points - were not about to interrogate the author.<br/><br/>But remember what I'm bringing up - Ron had the opinion that the book is like a guitar or box of crayons. I actually called it a (badly designed) game.<br/><br/>What I'm bringing up is; we have different, non compatable opinions. Why have we ended up with different opinions of what it actually is, if were all being sold the game as if it's <i>just one thing</i>? <br/>You might say it's actually being sold as many things. Ok, if it's being sold as many things, why is Ron saying it isn't what I thought it was, but actually like a guitar/crayon box? His opinion is that is what it is, not a my thing as well.<br/><br/>There is a discrepancy in our opinions and they are not compatable. Ron said it's like a guitar - and that's all. Not a guitar and a chess like game. I said it was a game, not a game and guitar/crayon thing. That discrepancy does exist - why? It's evidence of some prior event. Opinions are formed from prior events, they don't just pop out of thin air, as we both know. I would say the discrepancy in our opinions (particularly in how it can only be one opinion or the other, as Ron stated the games like a guitar <i>only</i>) indicates some discrepancy in the past has occured. It could just be bad reading by either party - John enlightened me to some details of how D&amp;D is sold, for example, that I didn't percieve before. That might be the entirety of the story, but I suspect theres more, atleast in terms of books other than D&amp;D (like rifts, cyberpunk, etc).<br/><br/>Why the discrepancies that are just not compatable?<br/><br/>Your point forms are good - though in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, jeez, I wouldn't call him stupid. Perhaps in a major rut though. But yeah, good point form - it examines the various possible outcomes. Particularly number four - if it is like a guitar or crayon set, and I buy it as an apparently badly written game that I then try patch and play, I've been fooled. With my purchasing habits, I wouldn't have bought it if I knew it was just a toolkit.<br/><br/><br/>Tony and Ralph,<br/><br/>Speaking of opinions, I quoted Ron saying in his own words D&amp;D is like a guitar or crayon box. I shortened that to 'toolbox', but you've treated it as if I've just brought in this opinion all by myself. I haven't - Ron has an opinion of what it is which is both different and non compatable with my opinion. Please don't rush read and respond as if his opinion was  mine. I know I refered to his opinon with the short hand of 'toolbox' and I'm trying to use 'guitar and crayon box' from now on, awkward as it is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_161297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161297/#Comment_161297" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-07T16:46:21+00:00" title="August  7, 2008  4:46PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was the "snake oil dishonesty" statement that I'm responding to.

At all.  Period.  Neither D&amp;D; nor any of the other games you reference has any obligation to adhere to any persons definition of what constitutes a game.

But the purpose of a guitar, the reason for its existence, isn't to hang on a wall and look pretty, it's for someone to pick it up and play it.<br/><br/>A guitar is a tool for creating music. A box of crayons is a tool for creating art. A game (<i>any</i> game, not just an RPG) is a tool for creating gameplay.<br/><br/>I'll leave the prickly task of defining what a "game" is to folks smarter than me; I imagine whatever they come up with will make my head hurt. But I <i>think</i> we can all agree that, say, Monopoly is a "game", right? Just for the sake of argument?<br/><br/>OK, so the thing that comes in the box labeled Monopoly is a "game" (<i>the</i> game of Monopoly). And the thing that we end up with when we open the Monopoly box and set up the board and hand out the money and roll the dice and move the little shoe around is also a "game" (<i>a</i> game of Monopoly). The first "game" (the stuff in the box) is a tool for creating the second "game" (the activity around the table.) But the rules of Monopoly <i>aren't the only thing we need</i> in order to play a game of Monopoly. The rules, the tool, require human skill to operate. Not <i>much</i> skill, granted, but imagine trying to play a game of Monopoly with someone who <i>didn't understand the real world concepts of "money" or "property".</i> You wouldn't get very far.<br/><br/>The subset of games called roleplaying games is a weird beast in a lot of ways, but in this way they're no different from any other kind of game: they're just an inert set of rules until someone picks them up and plays them, and in order to pick them up and play them you need to bring human abilities to the game table along with the rules and game materials. Since roleplaying games exist to create shared fiction through gameplay (he blithely proclaims <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> ), one of the abilities you need to bring to the table in order to play them is creativity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_161491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161491/#Comment_161491" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-08T12:39:16+00:00" title="August  8, 2008 12:39PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ron, you're on to something here (and beat me to the punch, in fact):<br/><br/>A game is really at it's heart <i>an activity.</i> Not a product or artifact. For lots and lots o' years people have been saying to each other shit like "OK, come do this thing with me! There's three piles of stones, and you grab stones off ne of the piles. But whoever has to grab the last stone loses. C'mon, it'll be fun!"<br/><br/>That's it. That's a game. This thing you do together. It may or may not involve a specific tool or artifact. But <i>the game is the activity.</i> It's a product commerce and industry, especially in our modern Toys R Us culture (to say nothing of Atari and Nintendo) that many games involve a specific branded product that you purchase in store, and come to think of that product as "the game." It's not. A game is nothing until you <i>do</i> it. Referring to the box full of Monopoly board and pieces as "a game" is just a shorthand for "that trademarked set of equipment necessary to play the game." Only this shorthand is largely unconscious for most folks engulfed in our age of branded products.<br/><br/>When I first learned of roleplaying games (a cool older kid invited me over after school and played Marvel Superheroes with me), I was not financially or logistically positioned to purchase a Role Playing Game Product<sup>TM</sup> right off, so y'know what I did? Got some six-sided dice and notebook paper, and played with my brother in the back seat on a shopping trip, making up rules based on my dim memory of the published "game". That was a game. it was a thing we did. It was awkward and fumbling (we forgot to have the bad guys attack, since we were both engrossed in playing the good guys), but it was a game.<br/><br/>Now, I have read Ron Edwards' <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/articles/20/" rel="nofollow">"Cargo Cult" stuff</a> about D&amp;D, and I think it's apt. But that's a matter of the gaming <i>culture</i>, not "the things we call games." It's just a question of a particular hobby culture NOT having the unifying organizational force of, say, American Football. It's like drinking games that are played the world over at parties, but go to a different party and it'll be totally different rules. Or even established sports like Football and Basketball that have widely recognized and referenceable official rules but you still find all kinds of local street variants. Hell, you can't even get people to play Uno consistently and by the book. That's just people for ya. Nothing to do with what's a "game" and what isn't.<br/><br/>That said, if you want to argue that D&amp;D is deficient in some way as a product, that's a fine subject with a lot of potential (though possibly a lot of flamebait as well). But I don't see you making much of that point, Callan, except to use it in conjunction with Ron's statement as a shield. "Hey guys, what do you think of this position A here?" "Well, we think it's seriously flawed." "Hey, don't look at me--<i>my</i> position was this other one, position B--it's Ron who's saying A and I'm just examining it." Which is pretty evasive and makes everyone else's contribution to the thread awfully labor-intensive ("OK. So IF a person--not you though!--were to say that D&amp;D is X, for a certain value of X, then I guess I would, <i>in theory</i>, say to that <i>hypothetical person</i>. . ."). And anyway I think Tony's critique of your characterization of Ron's argument is spot-on.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161549/#Comment_161549" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-08T17:49:20+00:00" title="August  8, 2008  5:49PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2008 5:52PM by Callan_S.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Ron, thanks for posting,\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ron Hammack</cite><cite>Posted By: Callan S.</cite>A game is interesting even before your creativity is applied.</blockquote>\nNot if it's a roleplaying game, where applying your creativity is the<i>point of the game.</i><blockquote>The first "game" (the stuff in the box) is a tool for creating the second "game" (the activity around the table.)</blockquote>\nThere's also a third game, where it's about me trying to beat you (or someone involved). Tons of organised activities have centered around this for milenia. In this case, the second game - the one about creativity - is just a means to an end.<br/><br/>I think I'm stuck - I need to impress the millenia long history of gamist/third game play. But you think you already know gamist play, and think it's about creativity, so you'd see millenia of the activity your used to doing.<br/><br/>How could I put it in a penetrating way - umm, if they find a way to beat you that is without creativity or imagination, it will be employed. Creativity and imagination will be discarded like a used condom, if they serve no further purpose in winning. Sirlin gives an example of this here in street fighter ( <a href="http://www.sirlin.net/archive/art-of-war-part-1-sheathed-sword/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.sirlin.net/archive/art-of-war-part-1-sheathed-sword/</a> ).

Instead, in an amazingly boring and non-crowd-pleasing show, I attempted to prevent actual fighting through my "brick wall trick" of low strong. Furthermore, I bored my opponent into attacking hastily at times, and generally frustrated him, or at least think I did.</blockquote>\nCreativity and imagination are just another resource to sacrifice. Milenia of playing like this - you think you know gamism. But to end on a dramatic flourish, you can't imagine discarding creativity and imagination for the sake of winning, because that'd defeat the purpose of 'play' for you. Until you can imagine discarding them to win, you don't know gamism. Your going to keep seeing thousands of years of gameplay as being your history alone.

I estimated there was an arguement, and tried to find what it's core was. I got the wrong core.<br/><br/>Do you guys <i>always </i>know exactly what the other guy is arguing for? And someone else is gets a negative noun if they grab the wrong core, in their own thread so it doesn't spoil other peoples threads?<br/><br/>Based on that core, I also pitched it as 'Well, I'm stuck - so I'll just wrap up on these words'. And I'm being told I'm still trying to make my point. Just as much as I got the wrong core, telling me I'm still making my point is incorrect.<br/><br/><br/>Tony, your moderating. You don't see any value in the threads topic for you, but your still here, like some property of yours is still involved.<br/><br/><br/>Christopher, well, I thought a marked distinction in use had occured and we could go from there. But the distinction got blurred. It's one of those threads where you think you have solid ground to work up from, but then find even that ground has to be worked on prior.<br/><br/><br/>Ron,<br/><br/>If you had said "Not if it's a roleplaying (activity where for milenia the point has been to win), where applying your creativity is the point of the game" then you could understand why I read it that way. The word 'game' chimes up in the same way for me - it's shorthand for that stuff in the brackets. So in my language, you did say say it's about creativity, because (Assertion!) the game can't have two points. So I assumed - ass that I am, that you were saying the second point trumps the first. That you were saying creativity trumps playing to win in terms of being the activities point.\n<blockquote>If you'll refer to the text of my actual post, you'll see that what I stated was that one of the things that roleplaying games require from players is creativity. Not the only thing, and possibly not the primary thing</blockquote>\nAlso under my language, if you say creativity is the point, then it is the primary thing. It can't be the point, yet not the primary thing. If creativity is the point/primary thing, and gamism sometimes ditches creativity, then gamism is not part of that activity. Again with the disclaimer of my language use.<br/><br/>I'd ask that, as much as anyone reading is frustrated with me or whatever, don't take a shot at my use of language. The tower of Babel wasn't my fault. Also, while my language use might be different, I don't think it's dramatically different - "the point of the activity called 'game' is to win" is kind of a vanilla interpretation. And treating the point and primary thing as being the same - seems kind of a dull on my part and not very inventive. I don't feel I'm going on a wild tangent with them, even if they don't match others use.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think weve all seen the same language used in different ways and usually only after the difference has had its effect.<br/><br/><br/>P.S: I doubt anyones interested in my whimsical investigation, but I was thinking about what if you put the words in the other way around 'Game Roleplaying'. That'd be roleplaying out a game rather than gaming out roleplay. Which word modifies the other depends on order, I suppose!

That's why there's such a social focus in gamism (it certainly shows up in Sirlins articles in when he refers to the street fighter tournaments) - Gamists care about who they try to beat more than the game they actually play. Because in the end it's all the same and only people are different - so it's only really the people who are interesting. New games just help you find out more interesting stuff about those people. I suppose that's part of why I can't seem to read alot of RPG's sprinkled on the web - I just don't find the books themselves interesting - and they usually go on and on about their little procedures and not how I can get at the interesting people I want to get at. I like the card game 'lunch money', for example - but I play it with people I'm interested in. There are alot of admirable design qualities in lunch money, but I don't play it for those qualities for their own sake.<br/><br/>I meander. Ultimately, yeah, all the same. What do you guys play them for? Do you play jenga for how it needs a steady hand, or game X for the Y that's often involved in it? I'm just asking in a wraping up the thread, tie off what lose ends we can, way.\n<blockquote><b>Roleplaying games (whether you're talking about RPGs where the goal is to win or ones where the goal is something else) are about creating shared fiction through gameplay.</b> Creating stuff requires... that's right,<i>creativity.</i>To get back to your original post, it's not at all dishonest to call RPGs games instead of toolkits just because they require creativity from the players.

the missing thing in RPGs is that they don't tell me how to play them, wich means to me they are just toolkits. For me Cyberpunk, Shadowrun, games like that are toolkits, but are sold as RPGs. DnD is a toolkit, too, but at least they say so. And the interesting thing is: DnD is much more conscious about helping players how to play for example by using CR and DL than all the other RPGs wich are much less toolkits. Maybe this all is only about that the authors of DnD realized and got conscious about that it's just a toolkit, so they are trying to make a better toolkit of it.<br/><br/>You know, my definition of a game containts that it has rules. But in most RPGs you have rules only for the minigames (combat, magic, etc.), wich are mathematical games that are only parts of the game. But you have no rules about how to play the game itself. Where speaks when, what does it mean, what have relevance, etc. They all just assume that the players know already.<br/><br/>Also I don't agree with you that the point of the game would be to win. That's only the point of a mathematical game. The point of a game is to have fun even if you lose. (Think about the games of forfeits where you can get back your forfeit by givin a kiss. The point is the kiss although pretending that the point is getting back your forfeit.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162118/#Comment_162118" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-11T18:21:24+00:00" title="August 11, 2008  6:21PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's alright, I think a few people rushed past that post.<br/><br/>I appreciate it that your showing the evidence your working from (eg, they don't tell you how to play) and drawing a conclusion from that. I think some people might be trying to apply some sort of causality - that if something needs creativity, that's a causal result of it being about creativity to begin with. <br/><br/>Personally I've half coded computer games - they'd need creativity from anyone I released them to. But that doesn't mean their point is creativity - their just half finished - half done - half arsed. I was just lazy, I wasn't creating some object of creativity. So to me, what comes after does not define what comes before - a thing that needs creativity doesn't causally mean it's original point was creativity. It might be, or it might be half arsed - there's probably a few more possibilities as well. Causal deduction works in nature - if you release something and it falls, there's gravity. But men are different from nature - when you play something and it requires creativity to play, that doesn't causally mean they intended creativity to be part of it. Like me, they might just have been lazy.<br/><br/>Obviously I'm just working from evidence as well. My question is, why are we working from such different viewpoints?? Causal deduction wont clear that up - that these things require creativity could as easily mean the author was lazy as much as he intended creativity. There's still an ambiguity as to why were in such different positions.<br/><br/>In terms of playing to win, I would argue against saying playing to win is only in 'mathematical games'. It's in 'games' as well - and what you describe is in 'games' as well. The same word being used in two, probably not terribly compatable ways. Otherwise I think that might be used to try and resolve this - that RPG's are called roleplay games, and not roleplay mathematical games. I don't think it does resolve it. Giving 'play to win' some new name doesn't resolve it - personally I think play to win is the true game and your type of game deserves some differing name. Again, were both in different positions but using the same word. It's an interesting ambiguity - one that slightly threatens some of <i>our</i> personal identification and status, to a degree.<br/><br/>I'm not familiar with the game of forfeits? With what your refering to, is it sort of like in (probably most) games of strip poker, where really they want to get naked in front of each other or get some sort of sexual level risen, and simply need an excuse - something which facilitates it and to a degree, controls it/stops it becoming too chaotic?<br/><br/>I get that the game isn't the point in that case. I think I'd just call it a ritual though - but nobodies going to be honest about what it really is ("Care for a ritual of strip poker, anyone!?"), in case that gets in the way of the boobies being shown. Boobs trump truth <img alt="&gt;:)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/naughty.png" title="&gt;:)"/> <br/><br/>The play to win I refer to is about breaking ritual - ritual in yourself is your enemy, it makes you predictable - and it's your weapon in others, as they can be predicted. I estimate what your refering to is something that reinforces ritual. Complete opposites, in other words, both using the exact same name. Hehe, don't take me seriously here, but RPJ comes to mind - roleplay Janus. What do you think?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_162147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162147/#Comment_162147" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-11T23:51:34+00:00" title="August 11, 2008 11:51PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Callan S.</cite>Personally I've half coded computer games - they'd need creativity from anyone I released them to.

But you play it, and you have fun, despite or even <i>because of</i> the necessity for creativity. You show it to your friends and they like it, too. Maybe it was sheer luck that your laziness resulted in a fun game, but whatever. You're a bright guy who recognizes an opportunity when you stumble over it, so you decide to release your half-assed game. But obviously, you're not going to <i>market</i> it as A Half-Assed Game Written By Someone So Lazy The The Poor Schmuck Who Buys It Has To Use Their Own Creativity To Even Run The Damned Thing. <br/><br/>So what to call it instead. Hmm. How about... A Game Of Your Imagination! Maybe it's a little dishonest, recognizing a deficiency in your game and turning around and calling it a <i>strength</i> instead. It's the kind of dishonesty called "marketing".<br/><br/>So you release your Game Of Your Imagination, and to your complete surprise, the damned thing <i>takes off!</i> People are going nuts over it, it's selling like hotcakes, and suddenly everyone wants a piece of the action. So they start writing their <i>own</i> Games of Imagination. Most of them are just clones of your game, but some of them have some innovative bits. Before you know it, a whole <i>industry</i> has sprung up around games based on your half-assed lazy game. Heck, maybe some pretty smart folks even start coming up with <i>theories</i> about how to make Games Of Your Imagination even better. <br/><br/>Maybe all of this <i>started</i> because you were lazy and dishonest, but all of those <i>other</i> people who copied and innovated and theorized about Games Of Your Imagination, are <i>they</i> all dishonest? I don't think so. Not if the deficiency that you recognized in your original game really <i>was</i> a strength for them. Not if your original, shoddy, only-a-toolkit-not-a-real-game excited the imaginations of a couple of generations of players who honestly believe that an activity that requires to be creative before they can even begin to sit down and play really <i>is</i> a game, and a damned fun one at that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/algi" title="algi"><img alt="algi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/algi">algi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162172/#Comment_162172" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-12T05:02:38+00:00" title="August 12, 2008  5:02AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, a bit of clearing up first. A "game of forfeits" is a term wich I looked up in a dictionary. I don't know if it exists in anglo-saxon culture, so I tell a better example. There's the game when the kids are running around and there's one of them who has to catch any of them. I don't know the English name for it, but I'm sure it exists all over the world. But there are varieties. For example you could play this jumping on one leg instead of running. The emphasize of the game shifts from "who's faster" to "how funny is it when people try to be fast on one leg". I read a book wich listed the rules of 366 such parlour games and each and every one of them had a secondary(?) emphasize aside of winning. This can't be chance. My theory is that every game has to have something else than winning and winning is only a simple common basis that can lure people into play. (Like in a gamist campaign you play to win, but for enjoyment you need a good story told by the GM.)<br/><br/>About laziness. Are the filmmakers of Hollywood lazy because they just use the same old patterns and stereotypes instead of finding new, original ways of filmmaking and pioneering with experimental films? In a way they are lazy. But in another way they work harder than some "artists." Because these traditional RPGs are in some way like Hollywood. They don't experiment, they just do what was popular before. They won't get 100 times more popular than before, but they won't either fail to be popular. They are secure. You don't have to be afraid that the next edition of DnD won't be popular. That's not possible. Is it laziness that they don't try to abide some indie definitions of RPG? Dunno.<br/><br/>The important thing is, that they don't care about some off-the-earth, walking-in-clouds definition. They don't think about what sci-fi is really in Hollywood. They don't care about the definitions of horror. They have a pattern that says: "This is how you make sci-fi films." or "This is how you make horror films." and they use it. They don't care about theoretical definitions? They have the practical definitions that work for them and wich communicates the buyers what those are. If you tell someone that "This is an RPG.", that someone will think about geeks and fantasy and thick books and illustrations and dice and charsheets if this someone has heard or seen of it. But if not, even than, that someone will have an impression of orcs and elves (it's inevitable after the LotR movies). So if someone wants to do some revolutionarry different, I wouldn't use the word RPG. Because some computer games are more associated to the word "RPG" than PTA for example.<br/><br/>I think you have to think practically, not theoretically if you want to have "real" answers, because these people, who publish RPGs don't think theoretically.

A really good question.<br/><br/>I would say the problem is, that while the author knows its half assed and not really a game, people are genuinely using it as a precedent to call their creations a game.<br/><br/>Even that's not so bad, but to be more exact, people grab onto flawed design elements (different people will grab different ones) and hold onto them as well made, because they have been told these elements are how a roleplay game is properly made.<br/><br/>These elements will never be improved - because the person was told they are proper game components as is. Why mess with perfection? The stuff the author knows is flawed, will be reproduced and propergated over and over again. It wont be changed, because they have been told 'that's what games have' and so if you changed it/refined it, it wouldn't be a roleplay game.<br/><br/>If the original author thought it was perfect, then cool, it's okay if it never really changes.<br/><br/>But if the original author knew it was flawed, and it never really changes - it stagnates - then what?<br/><br/>You might say indie game designers know how to break out of old habits. Out of interest I looked at Ron Edwards Spione page and it describes the book as "Story Now, a new way to author and enjoy spy-fiction.". No mention of game on the front page, atleast (does use actual play - but one also plays in a music band too). I'd agree he's broken out of old habits - indeed, he was able to stop using the word game and instead something that really describes the product.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_162329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162329/#Comment_162329" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-12T18:45:12+00:00" title="August 12, 2008  6:45PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Callan S.</cite>I would say the problem is, that while the author knows its half assed and not really a game, people are genuinely using it as a precedent to call their creations a game.</blockquote>\nAnd if enough people do that for long enough, the word "game" starts to take on an expanded meaning that it didn't have when the original author knew it wasn't really a game.

But that's not because gamism needs it, but because it was stretched out.\n<blockquote>I read a book wich listed the rules of 366 such parlour games and each and every one of them had a secondary(?) emphasize aside of winning. This can't be chance. My theory is that every game has to have something else than winning and winning is only a simple common basis that can lure people into play.</blockquote>\nI think you'll find most games involve a toy element - like the ball in basketball. A ball is a toy. But just because there is a toy element in each one, doesn't mean they are about the toy. It's like this picture<br/><a href="http://www.braingle.com/brainteasers/teaser.php?id=26745;op=0;comm=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.braingle.com/brainteasers/teaser.php?id=26745;op=0;comm=1</a><br/>Do you see a young lady, or an old lady?<br/>In those games, do you see winning or do you see the secondary emphasis?<br/><br/>Those games are neither gamist nor about the second emphasis you talk about. They are like the picture - they contain both things. It's perceptual preference that makes it gamist or about the second emphasis. I see a young lady first, and I see gamism first. Are you also going to admit that it's just a matter of your preference that determines what you see, or are you going to argue it really is a picture of an old lady and those games really are about that other emphasis?<br/><br/>I recognise that my perceptual preference controls what I see - it's why with a bit of will, I can imagine a preference for sim or reignite my preference for nar briefly, like I can switch from seeing a young lady to seeing the old lady. But if I didn't realise those preferences control what I see, just like they do with the picture, I would take it that what I see it as is what it actually is. Clearly in the pictures case, that isn't true - it is not just a young lady.<br/><br/>On lazyness, I think you've generalized the idea to something abstract. I said I was lazy with the computer game coding. Unless your going to tell me that really I'm not, there's an example of atleast one person that just half assed made a product. There's no theory there, just a plain old fact.<br/><br/><br/>Jason,<br/>As I said, if you define games as being toolkits, there's no room for arguement - you've defined games as toolkits.

That leaves you with three options:  name a game that's not a toolkit and win; fail to name a game that's not a toolkit and lose; or lose by forfeit.  Thank you for playing The Great Internet Debate, I hope you had fun.  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/><br/>Personally, I don't know for a fact that it's impossible for a game to <i>not</i> be a toolkit -- but I find it hard to imagine what such a game would look like.  If nothing else, a game will always need someone to add <i>something</i> to make it work (even if it's just 1-4 players ages 8 and up).  I know that I personally can't think of any RPG, boardgame, or sport whose rules/packaging/equipment aren't essentially part of a toolkit meant to facilitate the process of playing, but perhaps that's only because the only games/sports I like are ones that have a toolkittiness to them, or because I was raised to believe that any claim of authority must be examined, questioned, and, when necessary, challenged.  If you (or someone else) comes from a different background and can explain to me how some specific game (particularly an RPG, since that's the niche we're looking at here) is not actually a toolkit, more power to you, and I am prepared to have my worldview rocked by this discovery.<br/><br/>But...yeah, like JDCorley, I think that you will inevitably fail to name such a game.  The nature of a complete game requires someone to play it, and I suspect that if nothing else, the very act of play encourages using the game as a toolkit; if the game provides <i>everything</i> and the people playing do not provide anything of their own, then what's the point of even showing up?  Automate that bitch and let the computers "play" it, I say.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_162405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162405/#Comment_162405" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-13T07:08:12+00:00" title="August 13, 2008  7:08AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is my laptop and automobile a toolkit?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162415/#Comment_162415" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-13T08:11:50+00:00" title="August 13, 2008  8:11AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2008 8:12AM by JDCorley.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know, I'd have to read the instructions that came with your laptop-and-automobile, jens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_162428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162428/#Comment_162428" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-13T09:07:16+00:00" title="August 13, 2008  9:07AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Callan S.</cite><br/>On your last post - is that post a toolkit?

The closest I've been involved to designing a game was helping friends testing/editing their games. I just asserts this because I'd rather be considered as a player, a consumer of rpg. I'd like to start with Callan's original post.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Callan S.</cite><br/>Personally I see all the editions of D&amp;D as failing to be games, without considerable work added (I'd forgiven them because theres so little understanding of how to mechanically handle the SIS). I hadn't considered them just as toolkits - that could be the truth of the matter. But they are sold as roleplay<i>games</i>, not roleplay toolkits. When I thought they were trying to make games but failing out of lack of skill, I'm forgiving. But in considering that they may indeed be intended as toolkits, then it's flat dishonest to use the word 'game'. I mean dishonest not in any deep, new way - it's the same old sort of dishonesty, like if you buy something at the shop and the guy behind the counter short changes you, that dishonesty.</blockquote>\nWhen I read the basic D&amp;D rule book way back in the 80's, out of the blue, without even being explained what a rpg was supposed to be, I kind of felt the game wasn't "honestly" a game at first. I was in the typical case of "let's figure out how this game works" out of the box, with nothing but the text to make sense out of it. It promised fantastic fun and adventures and had only some rudimentary instructions about making up a dungeon map and stuff like that. It was incomplete, and after discussing/playing with a buddy, we agreed "without considerable work added" the game would fail to bring fun. Did it stop us? Did we dump the fallacious game because it wasn't complete? Hell no. The opposite actually, this lack of completeness was like a siren call that has kept us playing rpgs all these years. Ok, we dumped D&amp;D for some other "traditional" rpgs, but they weren't complete either. <br/><br/>I appreciate very much all the struggling of indie game designers about finding new game design paradigms with ambitions like \n<ul><li>delivering fun consistently</li>\n<li>being easily understandable, even by newbies</li>\n<li>creating stories that make sense and resolve</li>\n<li>distilate game mechanics until they're relevant to what kind of stories the game is meant to create</li></ul>\nI'm convinced that real innovations happened and new forms of fun were facilitated, the indie scene has impressive achievements to be credited with. Still the freedom I saw and still see in those incomplete games hasn't disappeared to me. The author might have been dishonest, or unconscious how incomplete the game was, it doesn't matter much to me. It doesn't matter if it was laziness or incapacity to recognize a "weak" game design : it was because the game was incomplete that our teenagers mind started buzzing back then. Compared to wargames, video games and board games it was so unique, like : "wow you mean we can make up for what the guy forgot to tell us, and it could be different to any other players interpretation/creation ?" <br/><br/>It's very good that game design becomes more focused, more conscious, maybe more mature. It's good to try and reduce the level of noise between what the author intended and what the readers understand. But authors should be humble about what they think is their great achievement. Actual play, or literature "natural" selection, might keep a part of your work you didn't think much of. A bit like Voltaire who was proud of his theater plays and poetry, and was acclaimed while alive. But nowadays they're quite forgotten, and Voltaire's presence on bookshelves consist mostly of his novels and essays. Oh irony. So yeah a weakness to some, could be something fascinating or emancipating to others. I don't care that much what label the author has put on his work, I'll figure out for myself what it's worth and if I want it. Labels are usually useless because of marketing strategy and/or author's confusion anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162492/#Comment_162492" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-13T15:42:28+00:00" title="August 13, 2008  3:42PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2008 3:43PM by JDCorley.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>In the context of tooklits, what do you feel are the relevant differences between a laptop and a boardgame?</blockquote>\nUmmmm.....I'm confused as to why you're confused. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>A laptop is a very broad tool that can be used to do all sorts of things.

Unlike the laptop, it needs more than one person...like the laptop, to do certain things it requires extra work. You might need extra pieces, or maybe some money to have it do certain things.  (Try playing roulette with jellybeans - then try playing it with dimes - then try playing it with hundred dollar bills - then try playing it with Fastlane.

How do you prove you love someone? If you don't want to believe I love someone, that's it, it's unprovable. At that point, we part.<br/><br/>I'd say chess is not a toolkit, because I like it as it is (okay, it's not flat out love, I've never been in a chess club. But liking it is in a similar scale to love - or we can discuss if you think it isn't). When you love a person, you don't treat them as a toolkit - you don't love what you could turn them into, you love what they are. Same with liking a game - it ceases to be a toolkit because you like it for what it actually is. You might say the game changes with different people or locations - but so do our lovers, who have different moods, wear different clothes and catch colds sometimes. Beyond games, people put loving years into restoring old cars, or name their bikes, name houses, or even name streets. Beyond tool like utility, alot of people have a liking or love for things just as they are already.<br/><br/>Lets flip it around - if you think everythings a toolkit, what do you actually love for what it already is?<br/><br/>What's the f'n point of a universe full of toolkits (if you start treating all other items as toolkits too) if you love nothing? Tools are just a means - what's the point of a universe with only means and no end to it? Means towards means towards means toward means, for milenia, going nowhere? May as well curl up and die.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure that isn't the case, and that you'd have quite a few things you like or even love. Are they toolkits?<br/><br/>And to tie this into the subject - if RPG's in general are suposed to be purely toolkits, what do you like/love about them to put in all that effort?<br/><br/>Do you just love toolkits for being toolkits? I can accept that love as existing. But if they are about that, why don't they proclaim that love on front cover, on back cover and on the first page?  If that love is the point of the book, how come I couldn't and still can't really see it?<br/><br/>Replace 'love' with 'like', if you want to, or an appreciative word you'd prefer to use.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162564/#Comment_162564" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-14T07:43:28+00:00" title="August 14, 2008  7:43AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Callan S.</cite>if you think everythings a toolkit, what do you actually love for what it already is?</blockquote>\nWhat's wrong with liking or even loving tools?<br/><br/>And not everything in the world is tools.

There is no comparably reliable term for the other end of the spectrum, games that build up the milieu, tone, and everything else in advance. "World-specific", "setting-deep", and the like all wave at the concept. But where I come from (&lt;-- said as I adjust my fedora and straighten my double-breasted suit), these are all <i>kinds of games</i>, not things other than games.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt surprises me that experienced customers might not know this, particularly the "toolkit is a kind of game" terminology. But then there's a lot of world to know, and not enough of any of us to know it all in, I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I also really like the emphasis on gaming as an activity, and if I could spread that back through time I would.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162938/#Comment_162938" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-17T20:03:15+00:00" title="August 17, 2008  8:03PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2008 8:07PM by Callan_S.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Bruce<br><br>Yes, but as you say, it's a tradition - it's opinion passed on through generations. What <i>seems </i>to happen throughout this thread is that opinion is stated as fact - when I pursue it to it's core, it gets the defence of 'Well, the book is whatever you want it to be', which is true (you can buy one and wallpaper your living room and I'll nod and say that for you, it was what you wanted it to be). When I pursue that it's whatever you want it to be and say "A toolkit is just one preference and there are other preferences, so the word 'game' should not be used to describe a product as suitable for two very different preferences", eventually the thread returns to stating it as fact that game means toolkit (as if it's not a preference/opinion). Then I pursue the 'fact' and so on in a loop, till everyones apparently pissed. I'm noting this just on the off chance it could happen again and stating it might nip it in the bud.<br><br>Ron Edwards has given examples in the past to illustrate the difference between two RP agendas. I think one was along the lines of it's like one guy who buys a motorbike to race it, and the other buys it to hang it up on wires, spray paint it gold, grow vines on it and sells it to an art gallery for a cool million. They are both using the product in very different ways and having fun. That's all fine and cool.<br><br>What isn't cool is when the company sells the bike as if it's designed for both uses, when really its far better designed for only one of those uses. When the engine is choked dead (or missing entirely) but damn, does that chrome shine and it has hooks for wires, its essentially designed for the artistic creative guy. For the racing guy, it's a complete lemon - but sold to him as if it meets his needs.<br/><br/>When I say 'What if I don't want to have to use creativity' the responce is 'But look at the problems with it if you don't - it must be about creativity!'. That's doesn't really address the problem - why do I think I can play without creativity? Perhaps because it's sold under the same names and labeling as games like chess, where you don't have to be creative (you'll most likely lose, but it's valid play not to be creative or get lazy in moves during a game). The naming and labeling gives the false impression that I can play without being forced into being creative, in the same way I can play chess uncreatively. Basically because the title 'game' and associated labeling have had their meaning rewritten to mean creative endevour, by people who would never sit down to a <i>game </i>of chess or a <i>game </i>of basketball to get their roleplay fix.<br/><br/>I dunno what else to say. I think if you guys saw a tube of red paint with 'Red Role Play Game!' written on the side and nothing else, you'd think it awesome. Which is fine. But trying to explain that someone might buy it expecting something chess like because of the naming, is rather difficult in those circumstances.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mrigashirsha" title="Mrigashirsha"><img alt="Mrigashirsha" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mrigashirsha">Mrigashirsha</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163088/#Comment_163088" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-18T17:10:37+00:00" title="August 18, 2008  5:10PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Callan, I'm not so much attempting to tell you your definition must be wrong, as pointing out how the people you're heated up about use it.

Fair enough, that's your opinion. And because your opinion disagrees with me, your saying I should appologize? Aren't you doing exactly the same thing? <br/><br/>Because your opinion don't agree with my opinion, your telling me I did something wrong and should do X, because my opinion doesn't match yours. That's pretty much what I've said about RP book makers.<br/><br/>People crash cars into things, causing huge property damage, even killing people, every day. They don't mean to, but it's still delt with in a legal sense. I'll grant that they didn't mean to is often estimated by the judges involved, sometimes reducing the penalty given. But overall the legal system disagrees with your opinion that if they were doing their level best, their off the hook.<br/><br/>Although I'll grant the legal system is a large opinion, so I guess in applying (what I know of) their fair trading laws I'm just using opinion against your opinion. But as much as I think the law is an ass, that's who I'm going with here. Who are you going with that makes you confident enough to talk ramifications already?<br/><br/><br/>Ron: Well, what was on the box? I doubt it was 'One who computes'. Again, I'm working from what I know of fair trading laws and labeling. Those laws are all (entrenched) opinion, of course. But I think it represents, crudely, a shared goodwill between people. Perhaps the way you deal with the authors is part of a different shared goodwill - that's why I mentioned a potentially new culture breaking out, further up the thread.<br/><br/>But at a practical level, to be tolerated as a culture by other cultures, you actually have to indicate your culture exists. You can't avoid stepping on something if you don't know it's there.<br/><br/>I think that was my conciliatory point up thread, that it might be a culture who does things quite differently. This, rather than applogizing for my own chosen culture when a new one steps on it's toes. Hey, I'm not Kirk, I don't expect to be running into new cultures every day!

Everyone thought the world was flat at one point, after all.<br><br>Large demographics of people might think that alot of people saying X means X is true.<br><br>In practical terms, if your culture has the numbers, it can spread like wild fire amongst the latter group. So I guess it's important. No more true to me, but certainly I see the riddle of steel in action, which is an important consideration.<br><br>On the other hand, a concerted push by prior culture early in the genesis of that D&amp;D culture would have brought it to extinction just as much as you think your use of the word 'game' should make the prior cultures use of 'game' extinct.<br/><br/>Important? Yes, riddle of steel style. Right because it's important? Dunno - this is magnitudes above 'you done broke mah law!'. But you just asked if it was unimportant, so I'm just dragging in extra stuff.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7239/game-or-toolkit-and-seller-honesty" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7239/game-or-toolkit-and-seller-honesty" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7239/game-or-toolkit-and-seller-honesty/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7239/game-or-toolkit-and-seller-honesty/p3" rel="next">3</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7239/game-or-toolkit-and-seller-honesty/p3" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F7239%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F7239%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Game or toolkit, and seller honesty - Page 3 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7239/game-or-toolkit-and-seller-honesty/p3" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Game or toolkit, and seller honesty - Page 3" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7239/game-or-toolkit-and-seller-honesty/p3" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Callan: What's your argument?

So if the book is boring, it's boring in the same way that a guitar or a box of crayons is boring... until you use your creativity and skill to do something interesting with it.<br/>If it's a toolkit, it should be called a roleplay toolkit. A game is interesting even before your creativity is applied. If it's a toolkit, there's a snake oil dishonesty in it being sold as a roleplay<i>game</i>. It'd be like selling a car mechanics toolkit as a 'game'.<br/><br/>You think it's a toolkit, I think it's supposed to be a game. It could be either, that's cool between us. But surely we'd agree that when an object is X, but sold as Y, there's dishonesty going on with the seller?<br/>Personally I see all the editions of D&amp;D as failing to be games, without considerable work added (I'd forgiven them because theres so little understanding of how to mechanically handle the SIS). I hadn't considered them just as toolkits - that could be the truth of the matter. But they are sold as roleplay<i>games</i>, not roleplay toolkits. When I thought they were trying to make games but failing out of lack of skill, I'm forgiving. But in considering that they may indeed be intended as toolkits, then it's flat dishonest to use the word 'game'. I mean dishonest not in any deep, new way - it's the same old sort of dishonesty, like if you buy something at the shop and the guy behind the counter short changes you, that dishonesty.<br/>. . .yeah, that's not anywhere in the "original premise."<br/><br/>Honestly, you're moving the goalposts so much they're like. . .really. . .rapidly-moving goalposts. Analogies fail me, but the point still stands. Just what ARE we all discussing here?<br/><br/>I still think my point way back up there (which got largely ignored, but oh well--Bruce gave it a nod, at least) hits on the crux of the matter: Games aren't things you <i>buy</i> or <i>own</i>; they're a thing you <i>do</i>. Calling products games at all is just shorthand for "the materials that enable you to play X game." It's <i>useful</i> shorthand, so long as you don't make it more than it is.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163960/#Comment_163960" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T02:45:48+00:00" title="August 21, 2008  2:45AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 21, 2008 2:49AM by Callan_S.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From that post<br/><b>"But surely we'd agree that when an object is X, but sold as Y, there's dishonesty going on with the seller?"</b><br/>My summery<br/><b>"In terms of the law, when an object is X, but sold as Y, there's dishonesty going on with the seller"</b><br/><br/>I didn't mention the law in the original, because I thought it obvious the law would be involved to all and sundry.<br/><br/>I think your talking to me because you value my presence here.

The law doesn't work based on what you, personally, think D&amp;D; is.  The law doesn't work based on what the word "game" meant in Webster's original dictionary.  The law works based on what D&amp;D; <i>actually is</i> and what the words used to describe it mean today.  Referring the argument up to the courts is just a new take on the "objectively not a game" argument that everyone dismissed in the early part of this thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis makes me sad.  Not that you make the argument;  I'm fine with opinions I disagree with.  But you looked at a bunch of hard working guys and girls who made a kick-ass game because of how much they love RPGs and our community ... and you decided that you would take your disagreement with them over the game as a justification to call them liars and frauds.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese folks deserve better, and I am personally ashamed that <i>our forum</i> provided the stage for you to act out in this way.
