It seems rather different than most RPG approaches.<br/>\n<br/>\nOpus (my system) is designed so players can cooperatively decide on the story themes and style of game play at the beginning. I want to give lots of options but keep it flowing as a conversation (hence the questions in bold). Also, I need to keep it going with enough 'stages' so every player gets a chance to get the 'up' in some area or another should they feel the need.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are four categories and each has one or more questions to guide the decision process as well as some examples. I pulled out the descriptive text from the examples/suggestions, but I am sure you guys get the idea. My goals include simplicity (easy and intuitive for anyone) and speed (preferably 10 minutes or less). How can I alter the following to better accomplish my goals?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are the categories and leading questions I have so far.<br/>\n<br/>\nNARRATIVE STYLE<br/>\nThis is the general "feel" of the story, and the kind of emotional response you want the players to feel throughout it and afterwards. Includes the pace (speed and rhythm) of the story.<br/>\n<b>How will the audience/players feel and react?</b><br/>\n-Adventure, Suspense, Humour, Horror, Drama, Melodrama, Tragedy<br/>\n<br/>\nMOOD<br/>\nThis represents the typical emotional dynamics of the story's protagonists.<br/>\n<b>How do the characters act and feel?</b><br/>\n-Heroes, Anti-Heroes , Intrigue, Romance, Fellowship, Vendetta, Fish Out of Water<br/>\n<br/>\nPLOT<br/>\nThis represents the scope, organization and development of the plot and its twists and turns.<br/>\n<b>What is your goal? How do you achieve it?</b><br/>\n-Epic Mystery, Intrigue, Redemption, Intimate, Journey<br/>\n<br/>\nSETTING<br/>\nThis is the backdrop against which the story happens<br/>\n<b>When and where does the story take place? (Scenes)</b><br/>\n-World (Earth, Mythical Locations, Alternate Realities)<br/>\n-Timeline (Mythic, Historical, Modern, Futuristic)<br/>\n-Culture (Local, Global, Transient)<br/>\n<b>Who do they meet? How do they interact with them? (NPCs)</b><br/>\n-Social (Family and Friends, Fame and Popularity, Cloak and Dagger)<br/>\n-Combat (Barroom Brawl, Battlefield Survival, Martial Arts Action)<br/>\n-Creatures (Animals, Fairies, Monsters)<br/>\n-Faith and Miracles (Spirits, Sacred Places, Divine Intervention)<br/>\n<b>What they might use? (Items)</b><br/>\n-Gadgets (Cutting Edge, Steam Punk, Science Fiction)<br/>\n-Magic (Items, Spells, Places of Power)<br/>\n-Super Powers (Qualities, Abilities, Point-based Abilities)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are shortcuts if you want to see other parts of the system:<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ndQmwqcKJRV1Lts3YuhoV1-mi2jb3P2nMgdIigl3xjI/edit?hl=en&amp;authkey=CMGl1LsK" rel="nofollow">Opus: Core Rules</a> (20-some pages)<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0B68V85CGPirRYzE2MDUyMjAtNjFkMi00NmRjLWE1ZTctZTcyOWZmNjhlYjFj&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=COrQgI4M" rel="nofollow">Opus: Character Sheet</a> (one page)<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WN3tGNq38PiNPuL8mb7tt7rWBGF0O2K7HN1PNT3TYFw/edit?hl=en&amp;authkey=CLK55bcL" rel="nofollow">Opus: Rule Reference</a>(one page)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
