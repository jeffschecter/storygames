Will they survive, or fall to infighting, decadence and paranoia as the endless party wears on?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy inspirations for writing it run from Monteseguer to Umlaut, in terms of structure and setting. The game uses a deck of standard cards and plays in around an hour or so. It works best for three or more players and requires no Gamemaster. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to find out more, the game is available in print from Lulu:<br/>\n[url]http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/dance-of-the-damned/13236118[/url]<br/>\nor in pdf from Drivethrurpg (whwre you will need to log in as it is adult filtered):<br/>\n[url]http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product_info.php?products_id=84919&amp;filters=0_0_0_0&amp;manufacturers_id=2528[/url]                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298161/#Comment_298161" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-25T04:38:14+00:00" title="October 25, 2010  4:38AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What do players do in the game?
