Designed to be picked up and played instantly, FAITH is a collaborative storytelling game for four players. With no technical rules or overly complex structures, it's an ideal introduction to roleplaying. And with a solid set-up, wide open second act, and tight finale FAITH lets seasonsed roleplayers get downright unsavory.<br/><br/>Consistently producing engrossing tales through a flexible framework, FAITH remains infinitely replayable.<br/><br/>Welcome to Faith.

I wanted someone without any experience roleplaying, let alone story-gaming to be able to run it the second they got it home. The biggest part of that challenge was making it so that it would be fun for experienced storygamers too. I love reading roleplaying books as much as the next gamer but to people who've never played before rules can be a big barrier to play.<br/><br/>A specific difference with Fiasco is that Faith has specified scenes in the early stages of the game. This was to help people get to grips with what's going on before opening things up in the second act. It's easy for people to get into, but there's still scope for it to go in any direction.<br/><br/>Faith also has pre-gen characters with detailed backstories feeding into the set-up. This helps create some of the tensions that make these stories great.<br/><br/>To be clear, I don't think any of these things make Faith better than any of the great games out there, only different, which was the essence of your question.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412037/#Comment_412037" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-15T05:19:38+00:00" title="April 15, 2013  5:19AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is pretty exciting to me!
