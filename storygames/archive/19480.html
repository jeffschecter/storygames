These are just three picked at random from some of the methods I have listed for initiative, but the idea behind this is that the GM will have control over how they want the rules themed for their adventure, so a GM that would want a more social game would use the third method listed above in the example, or the first two if they want just plain hack, and slash. As will this in theory would allow the GM to control the level of completely, and time they want to invest in that section of rules. <br/><br/>I\u2019m wondering what others in the community think of this idea, have you seen this done before in a game if so I would love to know what ones, and how it worked out. I\u2019m working with a very simple stripped version of fudge, so I don\u2019t think I would have many problem adding these little GM tweak rules with worry of the system becoming bloated from the added rules.<br/><br/>Question to anyone responding have you played Fudge, if so did you enjoy it, and why.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433338/#Comment_433338" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-03T20:05:05+00:00" title="June  3, 2014  8:05PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there are definitely advantages to "modular" rule design, and having options to go with a game can be a good thing, so long as it's not overwhelming. (There should be either relatively few options, or a very thorough guide to how to choose the options.)<br/><br/>However, a whole slew of optional rules often means that the designer hasn't given a whole lot of thought to what their game is about, or how it does what it does. In other words, is it really possible to find four different options which are *equally well* suited to your particular game? Chances are that one or two of those are the best fit; keep those and discard the rest. It's better to have a strong, well-functioning game which is finely tuned than to offer "flexibility" at the expense of functionality.<br/><br/>I used to play Fudge a lot, and enjoyed it a great deal. The way the adjectives and the Fudge dice work together make it a very fluent and fluid language. Everything is rated on the same scale and is intuitively easy to understand. You don't have to explain to a newbie what "Great Strength" means, which saves a lot of time in one-shots or any situation where you're playing with players unfamiliar with  the system. That's a great feature.<br/><br/>The way everything is rated on the same scale is beautiful, too. You can meaningfully compare a roll, an attribute, the outcome of a roll, a difficulty, etc. (I've never seen another system that can do this; and I think it's potentially very, very potent technology.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433353/#Comment_433353" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-04T02:17:07+00:00" title="June  4, 2014  2:17AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2014 2:18AM by Rickard.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thought this thread was going to be about something totally different, about how to design rules to create a certain atmosphere.<br/><br/>I agree with <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> when he writes "...a whole slew of optional rules often means that the designer hasn't given a whole lot of thought to what their game is about,".  I want the game to provide me a certain gaming experience, and be given all those options means that each group will have their own suited experience with the game, and that they will also drag their own expectations into how roleplaying games should work, which means that this game will do the same thing as the games they have previously played.<br/><br/>However, there are people who like toolbox designs so I guess I'm not the target audience. I can only guess what they rather be focusing on rather than having the game system helping out in creating the mood.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trollkin" title="Trollkin"><img alt="Trollkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/416/nMMC7YR4RA7NU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trollkin">Trollkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433367/#Comment_433367" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-04T08:38:54+00:00" title="June  4, 2014  8:38AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I think I'm trying for would be a lite tool box with a baseline option I think is best for the setting included, and two or three options for GMs to give them some control of the system, and choose how stream lined they what the game to be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433370/#Comment_433370" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-04T09:17:08+00:00" title="June  4, 2014  9:17AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whataver you do be sure to explain upfront what kind for mood and theme will each optional ruleset generate.

This character chooses who goes next, including NPCs, and so on.<br/>Intervention in the order is possible spending a Plot Point, Benny whatever.<br/>You can use two-sided, two colored coins/cards to keep track of a turn.<br/><br/>Works great!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
