If your game isn't done, then channel your enthusiasm into <em>making it done,</em> rather than making it pretty.

Good dedicated help is hard to find and casual half assed help is often counter productive.  Selling as a Ashcan is both a way to attract the attention of those who are interested in providing help while filtering out those who are only casually interested.<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  You aren't paying money for an unfinished design, you're paying money to get a back stage pass, a behind the scenes look, a membership into the design club.  (I'll note that various Fan Clubs have been charging money for these sorts of things for decades, so its hardly a new / unexpected / or unwanted concept)<br/>\n<br/>\n3) No one is being ripped off if they're clearly told what it is they're buying.  If the purchasers consider that they got a good value for their money why should anyone suggest otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLet's leave aside for the moment the question of whether the model actually works.  We can come back to that later, but I'm not convinced its been around long enough or used effectively enough times to really gather statistically relevant success data.<br/>\nAnd let's leave aside for the moment the commitment the designer should have to the project subsequent to the sale -- especially if it was billed on the membership angle.<br/>\nAnd let's ignore for the time being those designers (if any) who've intentionally sold broken games they've no desire to work on further just to cash in on some money and cred.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm interested first in philosophical thoughts on the above ideas (and any others that have been put forth as reasons to Ashcan) especially as they relate to this notion of theft and deminishing the release of games.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've done it twice now (the first time was long before the term Ashcan even got Coined) and have had mixxed results, so I'd like to hear more about this philosophical angle of it just being Wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231044/#Comment_231044" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T05:37:11+00:00" title="September 10, 2009  5:37AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "Stain on initial releases that are complete" came before the Ashcan front, and in fact, I suspect it was one of the reasons ashcans got so much traction.<br><br>I got sick of buying games that are full of holes and marketed as full games.

It's what lead to the ashcans. And for me to feel better about it would probably take 3-5 years of only seeing games not riddled with holes coming out.

I am talking stapled and electrical tape bound printer paper with a manuscript style cover.<br>\n<br/>\n  Take for example the old silver age sentinels book from GoO, slap a coupon in the back and that would have made a great ashcan. For those who never saw the book it was a soft cover source book with no pictures and tiny text to reduce page count. Or maybe for a buck or two extra danger patrol could be shipped with the t-shirts as a cheap little stapled together book, might not be the final form it will be written in but hey you were getting the t-shirt any way right?                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bent" title="Bent"><img alt="Bent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.sporecloud.com/Images/TinySelf.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bent">Bent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231064/#Comment_231064" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T06:43:39+00:00" title="September 10, 2009  6:43AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How much does one charge for ashcans, generally?

Or games that have critical rules missing so they are impossible to run based on the book.  And these aren't just games you haven't heard of.  Shock: 1.0 was pretty notorious in this regard, as I recall.<br/><br/>The ashcan thing was originally started as a way to try to <i>fix this problem</i>, by allowing folks to do a limited release of games that they thought were pretty much done, to make sure that they weren't missing anything.  I'm not sure what bad experiences people have had with ashcans that make them have this attitude.  Personally, the ones I've seen -- Matt Snyder's 44, Paul Czege's Acts of Evil, Rob Bohl's Misspent Youth, Jeff HImmelman's Kingdom of Nothing -- have all been great and totally worth whatever I paid for them (I don't even remember what I paid for them; some of them may have been free).<br/><br/>Honestly, it seems like Shreyas is mostly pissed off because people assume his games are ashcans, not finished products, and then don't buy them for that reason.  Nathan has said as much about Annalise. Honestly, that doesn't seem like a problem wish ashcans so much as an issue between indie designers and their target audience, who don't seem confident about buying ashcans and are wary of buying (or even playing) anything that might not be "finished." (whatever that means).<br/><br/>My personal feelings are that initial playtesting generally should happen at home.  That by the time a game is put out there for other folks to play it, it should run pretty smoothly.  I'm not sure what the big deal is about "finished" stuff.  When I play Danger Patrol, for example, it doesn't feel like playtesting, even if I can give John some thoughts afterwards that might influence the direction of the game.  I just play the game and reflect on it afterwards.  And John's working on another version of the rules right now.  And I'll play those when they come out too.  No big deal.<br/><br/>I don't charge for pre-release copies of Geiger Counter, but that's my choice as a designer.  And, lord knows, <i>I'm not going to try to tell other designers what they should and shouldn't do when it comes to printing and selling their games.</i>  That's what I think is really bugging me about the anti-ashcan attitude.  If the ashcan thing ultimately doesn't pan out, folks will discover that on their own.  Heck, they may have already discovered that.  I haven't heard of any notable ashcan releases in a while.  Are folks kicking a publication strategy that's already changing or only being used for very specific purposes now?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231075/#Comment_231075" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T07:25:15+00:00" title="September 10, 2009  7:25AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The deal about finished stuff is that it's finished.

Still, that's changing as we speak, with more people hiring "outside" editors (often still their friends, but at least friends with better incentives).<br><br>Here's a guy talking about indie comics in that article I linked: "I find 80% of today's alt comics poorly constructed \u2014 a veritable colony of lean-to shacks that could be blown over in a strong wind."  Could the same thing be said about "alt roleplaying"?  Probably, though I might argue about the percentage.  And I don't think the line separating the more solid stuff from the weaker stuff is as easily drawn as ashcans / non-ashcans or finished / unfinished.  Honestly, it seems like we're continuing the same conversation that we had before we started using the word "ashcan," about how to create resources and methods so people can improve the quality of their games before release.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231084/#Comment_231084" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T08:01:49+00:00" title="September 10, 2009  8:01AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This conversation never reaches its conclusion, and it's a never ending attempt Jonathan.<br><br>Striving is endless.

It's like getting a sealed capsule out of a vending machine with a mystery prize.  For $10, you get something that might be awesome, or it might be weird and broken and the butt of jokes in my gaming group for a month.  My friends and I do a fair amount of playtesting; ashcans are a chance to play around with neat ideas that we might not otherwise hear about for a couple of years, if ever.  It's an evening's diversion for the price of a movie ticket for one, and it's not like we don't play plenty of "finished" games that turn out to have holes of varying sizes.<br><br>I'd like to address the complaint about blinged-out ashcans.  At the forge booth at gencon, this year, there was a table full of ashcans.  I'd never heard of any of them, and I didn't know anything about most of the authors.  Without reading through them (impractical given numbers and time reasons) or interrogating the people running the booth (also time-consuming, plus it was hard to find someone who knew about a particular ashcan), it was hard to figure out even the basic premise of the books, much less what was cool about their rulesets or what stage of completion they were in.  I ended picking up Mars Colony, not just because it had an obvious cool concept, but because it was a handsome booklet with clean, striking graphic design.  In the absence of more information, the "bling" is often all I have to go on when browsing ashcans to show me that the designer has an intriguing vision for their game.  (I also own the Acts of Evil ashcan, as one might predict).  Finally, let's note that I am, ultimately, paying money for your playtest document.  I'm happier about doing that when the ashcan is a cool object in and of itself.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231092/#Comment_231092" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T08:28:13+00:00" title="September 10, 2009  8:28AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 10, 2009 8:29AM by Graham.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's two sides to it, I think.

I think it's part of the creative milieu that makes indie games awesome. <br/><br/>When the barriers to entry are low, you get a vast range of quality. That's true of indie games, it's true of the Internet, it's true on YouTube and anywhere else people are empowered to release their creativity without barriers. We can either start raising artificial barriers, or we can embrace that phenomena and admit that it's a key part of our creative mix.<br/><br/>For my ashcan, I charge what it cost me to have it printed. I got it done as cheaply as possible at Kinkos. If you buy it, you're paying for the paper, cover, and binding. If you don't want to buy it, send me an email, and I'll send you the PDF for free. And FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE do not buy my ashcan if you want a perfectly smooth play experience.

You need a mass test for it--like a closed beta of a software program, where lots of people can sign up and you get a real stress test of your game.  It'll reveal things that internal testing can't.<br/><br/>Most traditional RPGs don't have this step, and it shows.  Even D&amp;D 4e could have benefited from mass testing of, say, the skill challenge rules or even the stunting rules (if you look at the errata, it's obvious that stunts were ridiculously hard in the original version and needed a drastic fix, something that individual playtest groups didn't find but the mass release of the game did).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231109/#Comment_231109" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T08:49:37+00:00" title="September 10, 2009  8:49AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think part of the massive stress-test of games doesn't come from the amount of people who play the game alone, but from their ability to interact with one another, notice patterns emerge, and then combine their analytical powers.<br/><br/>A thought, that perhaps playtest information should be shared between playtest groups, and not only given to the organizer.

Not a huge deal, I was just really surprised later to hear that "SiS will be coming out soon..." and I was like, "Wait, I *have* this game. What's 'coming out soon' then?"<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231127/#Comment_231127" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T09:40:50+00:00" title="September 10, 2009  9:40AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Jon, I'd like to stay on topic for this thread.

I was back-and-forth on the whole issue right up until Thursday morning.<br/><br/>I charged for a few reasons:<br/>-I spent money to print them.<br/>-I spent money to be at Gencon, in a booth, selling stuff.<br/>-I spent time putting this edition out that I would not have spent if it was free.<br/>-Ralph's 1 and 3 from up there.  Hopefully not his <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>.<br/><br/>But my two big reasons for charging the paltry $5?<br/>One, because nobody - NOBODY - gives a shit about free stuff from Gencon.  If you give out a hundred free copies, 50 will go in the trash before they leave Indianapolis, another 20 will go in the trash when they get home.  Of the 30 that are left, 25 will sit on the shelf until the heat death of the universe.  The last 5 will get looked at, maybe, in the next year.  Someone will consider playing one of those 5.<br/><br/>Two, my time and yours is worth more than your five bucks.  I could achieve the same basic effect that Ralph is talking about with his <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> by, instead of charging a little bit of cash, I spent the whole weekend stumping and shilling my free game.  But then I've burnt through my weekend, and I've wasted the time of a whole ton of people who aren't interested even a little bit, and caught a few people who seem genuinely interested enough to take it home and read it, and maybe play it.  Having the book at a booth in the dealers hall, for five bucks means neither I nor the people who aren't interested have wasted any time or energy trying to connect, and the people who are genuinely interested have taken it home, and because they've spent money on it, are unlikely to throw it out, and more likely to read it.  I think the jury is still out on whether they are more likely to play it.<br/><br/><br/>James                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231137/#Comment_231137" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T10:14:15+00:00" title="September 10, 2009 10:14AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon Rogers</cite>Have you ever bought an ashcan thinking it's something it was not?

There is also something happening with the game designer. A developmental step in their own ability to make a good game. Simply put a good idea does not equal a good game and certainly doesn't mean a person knows how to take the idea to good gameness or beyond. Most of us are not professional writers or experts in publishing (knowing the software or other technical details). An ashcan is a step out of the tidal pool into the big ocean, but not a big step.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've charged for my games since 1992. They were saddle stapled booklets and their editing sucked but they were the game. Charging was simply the only way I could afford to do it. None of us are rich and so we can't afford to give away product. Of course the work is the best we can do at the moment but it is always incomplete. You see the flaws after they come back from the printer. You see more flaws when you see how it runs at cons. You'll also see flaws if the game is reviewed. What you seldom get is feedback from purchasers. I still find tons of flaws in my work now and my stuff is pretty professional.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I started my game development I did the initial work in articles for game newsletters (roughly what forums like this and the Forge function as). We called those articles "Half Baked Ideas". Usually they were after action reports of game sessions. When I made a full game I made booklets because that's how I published my newsletter. I don't think I cheated anyone in those products. When you buy a cheap booklet you kind of know what you're getting. The steps that followed were as much about my own development as they were about the game. Hopefully the ashcans out now will continue to be developed but if they don't that isn't a crime. Sometimes we find sanity and don't have to publish anymore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231149/#Comment_231149" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T10:39:04+00:00" title="September 10, 2009 10:39AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>So, some replies and thoughts:</p>\n<p>Ralph, "Here are some arguments I have; let's ignore the counterarguments and doubts" i not discussing in good faith.

It's been <em>my</em> experience that if I, the designer, can't find the mistake, it's because there is something pretty profoundly screwed up about the design. From what little you've said here, it sounds like the 4e thing was more like a mismatch of player expectation vs. designer intent than a math accident (It's honesty pretty easy to do the math on skills). That's something Wizards has to worry about but we, as designers of basically disposable one-off games that seldom if ever see revision, don't.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231151/#Comment_231151" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T10:46:24+00:00" title="September 10, 2009 10:46AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hoho</cite>Nathan, can you elaborate?</blockquote>\nSure - this is what I remember, maybe it went in a different order. But! Bret was at, um, Dex Con 08 (I think?), where I had my handmade Annalise books. I had a conversation with him last March when we were hanging out with Jenn and Russell about Annalise, and he asked me if it was done, or something. And I was all "yeh, it's been done since I released it at Dex Con, I'm just playing with the production and form factor" and he was all "oh...well crap, if I knew it wasn't an Ashcan I would have bought it. Someone told me it was an Ashcan at the con."<br/><br/>It's not a huge deal to me personally, but it is germane to this discussion, I think. I have no problem with people choosing not buy an ashcan (or a prerelease version, or playtest edition, or whatever). I am uncomfortable with the notion that finished games are assumed to be those, because the dominating assumption (again, I think it's faded now, but last year in particular) was there the first appearance of a game was it's ashcan form.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231157/#Comment_231157" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T10:55:44+00:00" title="September 10, 2009 10:55AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I, too, have had games mistakenly pegged as ashcans.

I didn't really understand what an ashcan was; I saw an opportunity to get on the floor at Gen Con without breaking the bank. I couldn't go myself, so I asked a dealer friend to show it for me. <br/><br/>In exchange, he got to set the price and keep whatever he sold them for. To me, the hardcopies were a way to get the game into the hands of serious gamers. I'm interested in selling PDFs. My understanding was that by charging for it, people would become invested in it and give me feedback on it.<br/><br/>But I never intended to put out an unfinished product. I was blinded by the 'success' of signing with a PDF distributor and thought that the game was ready to go. I now see that it was not. If I had known that, I would have given them away to anyone who would sit down for a game and given me the feedback on the spot. That's what I tried to do this year at Gen Con. It didn't work out, but I don't blame the model, it was the amazing time I had playing other games.<br/><br/>This year, I made a new version and I intend to revise it again as soon as I get some substantial feedback. I hired a writer for additional setting and I have a layout person lined up. For the people who bought the game online, they will be notified each time the PDF changes. I only plan to change it once more, but if not, they aren't out any more money. This may be closer to a 'virtual ashcan' model, but it isn't what I intended.<br/><br/>But I am seeing the other side of the covenant break down. Not one person who bought or traded for the game has told me what they think about it, what is wrong with it, what might make it better. It's not just me; Julia Ellingboe said on a podcast that no one gives her feedback on Tales of the Fisherman's Wife. I gave my opinion on other ashcans, in public or in private as requested.<br/><br/>I would rather that it be thought of as a bad game than be thought of as an ashcan. I don't have an answer for the conundrum of getting feedback before releasing product.  But it was always my intention to deliver a good game, ready for a fun evening.<br/><br/>-Grant                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231180/#Comment_231180" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T11:55:07+00:00" title="September 10, 2009 11:55AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 10, 2009 11:56AM by Emily_Care.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Greg and Andy, I'm sorry it wasn't clear about Sign in Stranger.

I've seen evidence of this.<br/><br/>From the designer perspective, if you put the effort in to creating a physical object and then going through the hassle of putting it out there for sale and supporting it, you're telling your audience that you are serious.<br/><br/>I love people who give away free games. I also fear for those who make good free games that they fade into the background noise of people who do stuff that the consider to be worthwhile. Someone who is willing to invest time, money, and effort into a thing and back it with her name is someone that you can be marginally more sure is actually trying to put out a complete game.<br/><br/>So why not just make a game? Because you want to make sure the "final game" you sell is of high quality. <br/><br/>Why not just wait until it's of high quality? You can never be sure it's of high quality, in my opinion, until you've had a variety of people trying it. I played <i><a href="http://misspentyouthgame.com/" rel="nofollow">Misspent Youth</a></i> dozens of times before putting it out as an ashcan. I decided to publish it as one because (someone asked for evidence) I had given the document to lots of people and gotten one play report, ever.<br/><br/>I think ashcans are easy to discount if you happen to already have a name or are heavily plugged in. But putting something out there that says "I'm serious about this," and asking a nuisance price ($10 is a big lunch), you get what you need. I did, and it worked for me. (Also, it made me take my own work on the game much more seriously.)<br/><br/>As an aside, the nasty tone that pervades this discussion, from start to finish, is really annoying. I wish people wouldn't try to make swinging-dick points over this issue. I don't really see what people have to be upset about. If you're not part of the designer-to-purchaser exchange, I don't see where you have any right to have a problem with ashcans. It's none of your business, as far as I can tell.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231197/#Comment_231197" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T12:15:46+00:00" title="September 10, 2009 12:15PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't find the tone in this thread any nastier than the tone of people who proclaimed "I'd be sorry" for not releasing It's Complicated as an ashcan, actually.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang" title="Tim C Koppang"><img alt="Tim C Koppang" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang">Tim C Koppang</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231201/#Comment_231201" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T12:15:47+00:00" title="September 10, 2009 12:15PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is it possible that the problems with Ashcans, whatever they may be, ultimately stem from miscommunication between the publisher and the customer?  Here's my theory:  When the Ashcan Front debuted, it was during a time when everyone just *had* to have the latest and greatest games.  In the frenzy, ashcan copies moved, but customers realized only afterward that they had paid for games that weren't 100% done.  That left a bad taste in the customer's mouth.  Designers didn't get feedback.  Hence, the current backlash.<br/><br/>What problems do exist now are ones of misconception as to what an Ashcan actually is and is not.  Customers are afraid to buy anything that looks like an ashcan.  Some designers think they're a waste of time and/or confusing customers.<br/><br/>Moving forward, what should be clear with an ashcan is that the designer is asking the customer for feedback on a game that is "fun," but perhaps not 100% delivering on his design goals.  The customer should know what he is buying upfront.  The designer should have a certain expectation of feedback.  If that commitment on both ends isn't there, then don't publish or buy an ashcan.  If all of the above happens, then I don't see a problem -- just another avenue of publication for those who are interested.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

In the frenzy, ashcan copies moved, but customers realized only afterward that they had paid for games that weren't 100% done. That left a bad taste in the customer's mouth. Designers didn't get feedback.  Hence, the current backlash.</blockquote>\nI'm not sure that's accurate. If it is, it's news to me. In two years of doing The Ashcan Front I never heard feedback from anyone who bought an ashcan from the booth and only later realized it was a design-in-progress.<br/><br/>The backlash I saw against ashcans took two forms:<br/><br/>1. Folks who thought the transaction was backasswards; that rather than paying for an ashcan, they should instead be paid for playtesting and giving feedback.<br/>2. Folks who'd got caught up in the frenzy of the indie scene, published an ashcan they weren't happy with, and then later projected their personal frustration at having done this outward as a criticism of ashcanning.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231236/#Comment_231236" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T12:40:24+00:00" title="September 10, 2009 12:40PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm curious if ashcans are really resulting in better games. This is just some hefty skepticism on my part. Everything I have seen put out as an ashcan that seems to have sold well also seems like a game that people would have been willing to do outside playtesting for anyway. And the price tag and inaccessibility without an exchange of currency makes it inaccessible to people who may have been willing to do outside playtesting for free. I really wish there was a way to get numbers on this, but how could you really?<br/><br/>But video game developers are doing this right now. Like, you can only beta a game if you pre-ordered it. People are outraged about it, but in spite of that people still preorder it specifically because they want a shot at the game ASAP. That is having it's own wrinkle now though since once money changes hands some people are upset at the lack of a finished product. And regardless of whether they should have known it was a beta or not, it still generates ill will.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang" title="Tim C Koppang"><img alt="Tim C Koppang" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang">Tim C Koppang</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231239/#Comment_231239" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T12:40:44+00:00" title="September 10, 2009 12:40PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 10, 2009 12:45PM by Tim C Koppang.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>But actually, I don't know that I've heard any stories from people who bought aschans and felt ripped off.

As long as both designer and customer know what they're getting into, I don't see a problem.<br/><br/>As for the term itself, I think it's the one we have for better or for worse.  Personally, I don't have a problem with it.  I buy games, ashcan or not, if they interest me and I think I'll play them.  I'll try to give feedback whether a game is an ashcan or not.  But if someone specifically tells me in the introduction that their game is an ashcan, then I'll change the tone of my feedback to try to help make the game better for future releases.<br/><br/>Ashcans are part of the indie model (scene?) now.  I like it.  They're very lo-fi and exciting.  I like being part of the process.  And I'm more than happy to spend my money on a game someone put some effort into producing.  If someone produces a crappy ashcan that I buy, I'll be disappointed, but no more than if I purchased a finished game that was in fact only half-baked.  What's different about an ashcan is that I know what I'm getting into ahead of time, and I know that the designer expects (or at least really wants) an email from me.<br/><br/>What's really disheartening are all the stories about designers getting zero feedback about their ashcan.  That to me undermines much of the process.  As (or perhaps if) ashcans become more common, I hope this will change.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang" title="Tim C Koppang"><img alt="Tim C Koppang" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang">Tim C Koppang</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231243/#Comment_231243" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T12:43:02+00:00" title="September 10, 2009 12:43PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Paul.

I have only released one ashcan and I didn't push it. Got no results, played it myself, revised, released.<br/><br/>My experience as a game designer is uniformly unpleasant. The assumption of any newly released game is that it is an ashcan, which is shitty. I don't like being told my game is necessarily unplaytested crap over and over by people who just looked at it and saw the cover was black-and-white. It costs me sales. It makes me hesitate the produce games that look like I want them to, because I like a stark, simple, slightly unfinished looking cover design.<br/><br/>I can comment on what I see ashcan releases doing to their designers, but that's something they can probably talk about more. Most people who released ashcans have never finished the game in question, and not published any other games, as well. Basically, doing it seems to be, in maybe %80 of cases, total death to publishing, not just the game in question, but any material at all*. I wouldn't recommend it to friends.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben<br/><br/>* I think that this is probably related to the commercialization of the creative process, but that's a topic for a different thread and probably a different website.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231276/#Comment_231276" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T13:13:03+00:00" title="September 10, 2009  1:13PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How did that work out for you, Darcy?<br/><br/><span style="font-size: xx-small; font-size: xx-small;">also what is your real name</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess" title="Darcy Burgess"><img alt="Darcy Burgess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://home.ca.inter.net/~krunch/PBP/gc07/pics/icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess">Darcy Burgess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231280/#Comment_231280" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T13:18:26+00:00" title="September 10, 2009  1:18PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Hey Shreyas,</p>\n<p>How did what work out?</p>\n<p>I don't get the second question.</p>\n<p>D</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231284/#Comment_231284" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T13:20:41+00:00" title="September 10, 2009  1:20PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy, what does the JDCorley principle say?<br/><br/>As for people talking about telling others how to publish, and how THEY lose sales because of what OTHERS do: This is the other side of the coin.

That was an invaluable step in the development process for me, for several reasons:\n<ul>\n<li>I learned how to explain the game to people. The process of demoing it at GenCon had a direct impact on the final draft.</li>\n<li>I validated that the basic design was solid, and that people had fun with it, but there were a few details I needed to tweak. More importantly, I learned what those details were.</li>\n<li>I made a commitment to a group of people that I would finish the game. Only Ryan riding me was more of a motivator for the 18 months it took to finish the book. I had a group of people who were excited to see the final result, and I didn't want to disappoint them.</li>\n</ul>\nOn the "other payoffs" front, here's what I experienced:\n<ul>\n<li>I sold enough copies to break even on my production costs. It didn't pay for my hotel, for my airfare, or for my meals.</li>\n<li>I wider awareness of the game, which proved valuable for word of mouth when the game was finally published. I could have taken better advantage of this if the game had been done 12 months sooner, but c'est le vie.</li>\n<li>I felt like I was part of something. I didn't consider myself a game designer, but I suppose I could have.</li>\n</ul>\nI do find it amusing that when people talk about ashcans, <i>Penny</i> (along with <i>Sweet Agatha</i>) isn't usually on the list, despite being in the first batch of games to use the name.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis" title="Grant Davis"><img alt="Grant Davis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis">Grant Davis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231295/#Comment_231295" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T13:33:19+00:00" title="September 10, 2009  1:33PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 10, 2009 1:36PM by Grant Davis.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wouldn't blame ashcans for high game-design mortality.

It's also available <a href="http://www.gdrzine.com/index.php?option=com_rokdownloads&amp;view=file&amp;id=437&amp;Itemid=78" rel="nofollow">in Italian</a>, which is nuts for a game that's not "finished."  I have no way of knowing whether any of this is related to the 50 free, pre-release "ashcan" versions of the beta that were given away at GenCon 2008, but those surely didn't hurt.  However, I've also been working on the game off-and-on <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/2007/04/10/afraid-teen-slasher-version-17/" rel="nofollow">since April 2007</a>. If I had tried to publish the game a year ago or two years ago, it would have been less good.  Waiting, giving folks time to actually play the game, giving me time to step back from it... all those are making for a much better game. <br/><br/>I think Paul's ultimately right that the biggest enemy of all -- whether you're talking about ashcans or "finished" games -- is <i>ourselves</i>, especially in regards to rushing to publication. (Honestly, I think that's true of stuff like 4E as well. I'd be embarrassed if I published Skill Challenges like they are in the core books.)  But this is indie publishing, so if someone wants to spend a bunch of money to publish something... that's their business.  I've got that tattoo as well.  You just hope they learn from their mistakes -- I've certainly made some that I've learned a lot from -- and that, as a whole, we're all getting better at this.<br/><br/>EDIT: Ditto everything Guy says. People will eventually vote with their wallets. Honestly, I'm not threatened by half-finished games. I know that I have a solid product and I can compete with them -- and the perceptions they may create -- in the marketplace, even if my final print product will almost certainly "look like an ashcan."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang" title="Tim C Koppang"><img alt="Tim C Koppang" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang">Tim C Koppang</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231297/#Comment_231297" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T13:38:06+00:00" title="September 10, 2009  1:38PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 10, 2009 1:40PM by Tim C Koppang.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben,<br/><br/>Didn't you call the first publication of Bliss Stage, "Ignition Stage Edition" or something like that?

Last time I spoke with Julia she was working on finishing up Fisherman's Wife.  I am currently doing what may well prove to be the final round of playtests for Blood Red sands.  I know Paul continues to work on Acts of Evil and of course Misspent Youth is already discussed above.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you know what, if those are the only Ashcan's that make it to published status...whether that's this year, next, or the year after that so what.  If all of the other designers decide "hey you know what...I'm not going to be able to make this work, I'm moving on to something else" or "Man...game design ain't really worth it to me...I don't feel like doing it any more"...so what?  What's it to you?  Isn't it better they find that out after only the lesser investment of time and money in an Ashcan than in a final version.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Paul is never able to get Acts of Evil to do what he's trying to get it to do...does that make the Ashcan release a mistake?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you have misdiagnosed the problem Ben.  You want to produce games that physically look like what Ashcan's typically look like and you think that makes people think less of them because they think they're Ashcan's.  I submit an alternative.  That the people who think less of them because they think they're Ashcan's...would have thought less of them ANYWAY due to the format you want to publish them in.  The fact that they now have a label to describe why they don't like them (and a misused label at that) in no way suggests to me that they would have been customers of yours if that label/association didn't exist.  I think you're crying over milk that hasn't actually been spilt.<br/>\n<br/>\n"I don't want to buy your game because its an Ashcan" does not automatically mean "I would have bought your game if I'd realized it wasn't an Ashcan".  It may in fact just be a polite way of saying "your game doesn't look like something I want to spend money on."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231304/#Comment_231304" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T13:44:53+00:00" title="September 10, 2009  1:44PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 10, 2009 1:45PM by Elizabeth.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mist-Robed Gate was the "Cursed Seal Edition," with talk of an expanded edition in the future, and no one said a peep to me or Shreyas about it being an ashcan (which sort of refutes Jonathan's point above re: Shreyas' grump coming from lost sales; it does, but the sales lost haven't been <i>ours</i>).<br><br>I think the difference in form factor might have had something to do with the way our experience differed from Ben's.

There was a time when the indie vibe was comb bound black and whites printed at Kinkos.  Dust Devils, Troll Babe, OctaNe were all that way.  Production standards and customer expectations have changed.  Technology has improved and now there is a new standard.  When there were only 10 indie game titles in existance, if you wanted them...you took them in whatever format they came in.  Now there are...hundreds?  Scores at least.  Customers now have the luxury of picking and choosing on appearance rather than just taking whatever is there.<br/>\n<br/>\nProduction standards that used to just be how indie games were are now being used by Ashcans and finished products are held to higher production expectations.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo the extent that publishing a game whose production quality falls below the new median (because of a desire to be more punkish or grass roots or DiY) causes customers to think "That must be an Ashcan" we are well served to recognize that and plan for it in our development choices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang" title="Tim C Koppang"><img alt="Tim C Koppang" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang">Tim C Koppang</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231316/#Comment_231316" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T13:54:54+00:00" title="September 10, 2009  1:54PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben &amp; Elizabeth,<br><br>Again, I sympathize, but I also think you're missing my point slightly.

I think Polaris's initial sales can be attributed to the fact that there wasn't as much competition when it was released (and that it's a great game).  Now, with so many other games to choose from, it's easier to say, "I'll buy Bliss Stage when that final edition Ben was talking about is released, and spend my money now on this other game.

And a couple of the purchasers played it and gave me feedback, and some other folks who just read it also gave me feedback. And some of them were people I wouldn't have otherwise interacted with if they hadn't discovered the ashcan.<br/><br/>That's exactly what I wanted to get from doing it: playtesting, feedback, and insights from the game's eventual target audience.<br/><br/>Acts of Evil is a pretty ambitious design. Having the production of the ashcan as a goal really helped me get the evolving text into a form that others could playtest. But if I could have wrangled the text into shape without the focusing effect of planning toward the ashcan, probably I could have achieved a similar feedback and playtesting result to what came from ashcan purchasers by circulating the text within the design community. Though if I'd done it this way, I don't think I'd have found contacts and insights from the game's eventual target audience.<br/><br/>Danielle sold between sixteen and nineteen copies of the Kagematsu ashcan at Gen Con last year. Despite that it was an eminently more accessible and playable and fun game as an ashcan than my Acts of Evil ashcan, I don't think she received any playtesting or feedback from folks who bought it. <br/><br/>I'm not sure what the take-away is from that. It's either that you need to sell more copies to get the playtesting, feedback, and insights from the game's eventual target audience, or it's that unless you have earlier games with fans that you're unlikely to get playtesting and feedback, even if someone pays money for your ashcan.<br/><br/>Still, I think both of us had a uniquely valuable result from doing the ashcans that I didn't initially understand: we had created an audience of folks who were invested in the games, who could react to our questions with an informed perspective if we initiated discussions.<br/><br/>So, yes, there are other ways, but you can provoke playtesting and feedback by doing an ashcan.<br/><br/>And I don't know of a better way to find contacts and insights from your game's eventual target audience, or to create an invested audience who can react to your questions from an informed perspective, if that's what you need.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231339/#Comment_231339" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T14:14:30+00:00" title="September 10, 2009  2:14PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>James:</b> We should start a "Cheap Ass RPGs" site/booth and sell Death's Door, Primitive, Under the Bed / Journeying West, and Geiger Counter... and maybe give away photocopies of Lady Blackbird and Danger Patrol.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231338/#Comment_231338" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T14:15:00+00:00" title="September 10, 2009  2:15PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are people, Ben among them, really saying "Hey, my market audience had misconceptions about my product, and it's the fault of those guys over there!"<br/><br/>You can create whatever you want, of course.

Making a game allowed him to learn a bit more about how to write, how to explain it to people and it paid for itself. He'd have had the other Gen Con expenses anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\nBen's experiences on the other hand also taught him - just more painfully. I've felt that pain - every year my best efforts didn't sell as well as I wanted. I tried making cheaper lower production value games and they didn't sell. This doesn't mean the game is bad - it just means the packaging didn't work. The lesson is about how to make a better packaged game so it will gain the attention we want. Are we competing for attention? At the risk of sounding very Republican, yes!!! That isn't a bad thing or that we want to hurt one another it's just what happens in market places (like a Gen Con booth). When I don't get the attention I want I feel jealous - if I feed that feeling it makes me feel shitty. Game making then gives me the opportunity to learn how to cope with that. If putting my stuff next to ashcans doesn't help me sell then I find another place to sell. If I don't want to switch to the GPA booth I could squat at another booth. It's all a learning experience - one mistake after another.<br/>\n<br/>\nChris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231352/#Comment_231352" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T14:26:19+00:00" title="September 10, 2009  2:26PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Uh, people seem to think that I'm unhappy with sales for Polaris or Bliss Stage.<br/><br/>Just as a clarification: I'm not.<br/><br/>I am in fact very happy with the sales for both games.<br/><br/>Nathan was sharing his experiences, and people were brushing him off and telling him that he was an exception or a unique case, and I was piping up to say "uh, no, he wasn't."<br/><br/>Tim is right that this may just be increased competition, but I don't think it is.

Not so much the actual word "beta", but the concept of beta testing software is reasonably well-known and, importantly to this particular discussion, provides the end user with a reasonable expectation of what he or she is getting.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I've never produced an ashcan, but I've run a number of beta tests in my life. It's not exactly what you expect, so maybe some guidelines from beta testing might be of some use to those who actually do make ashcans. (If not, well, electrons are cheap).<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, what does "beta" even mean? There are many definitions, but two are fairly common. The "alhpa" stage of software is when all the features are written. This is "functionally complete". It may not have seen much testing, but every base you wanted to cover is covered. At this point, testing is still mostly internal. Some companies release alpha software, but not many. When all the <i>serious</i> problems you know of are handled, you release "beta". The expectation is that you may still need to change stuff, but the final result will at least recognizable what is in the beta.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn order of importance, the rules of thumb for beta testing are:<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>One: Find Problems</b> This sounds obvious, but is easy to forget in the middle of it all. <i>Everything</i> you do has to be filtered through the lens of "is this helping me discover flaws in my product". This is much harder than it sounds.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Two: Triage</b> Vet <i>every</i> problem you hear about, with the realization that many of of them <i>are not worth solving</i>. The quickest way to kill a beta is to treat everything as important. Many things will not be. Some things will be, but fixing them will do so much collateral damage that you are better off not bothering (for this version, at least). It's rare, but you may also run into a deal-breaker issue: a design flaw so jarring that you need to head back to the drawing board. (This is rare, but every time I've seen it happen was because of misunderstanding what the user's needs were.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Three: Keep Costs Down</b> Don't print documentation if electronic will do. Don't burn CDs if downloading will do. Don't pay bribes unless you have to. Don't advertise unless you have no other choice. Don't spend time with people who aren't helping you if you could be spending it with people who are.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Four: Control the Product</b> The type of control here refers more to control of the product's destiny than its content; that is, managing the "intellectual property rights" and market share. How this is done will be <i>radically</i> different depending on the product and circumstances. For some products, this means super-secret betas with NDAs signed by everyone. For others it means massive public betas for maximum exposure. If there is an art to beta testing, figuring out the right mechanism for control of your product is it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Five: Finish</b> The beta is useless if it never ends. A common mistake is to set a "finished condition" based on the problems found, such as "when all issues of Medium severity or higher are fixed". Done this way, either the beta will never end, or it will end only because issues are managed artificially to meet the condition by a certain time. Generally, a timed deadline works, and everything else doesn't. The goal isn't a perfect product; that doesn't exist. Instead the goal is to make the the product the best that you can make it in the time allotted. If you aren't proud of the result, no one else will be either; have the decency to kill it and move on to the next thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf all of these, most of the techniques used in the software industry would work for RPGs. The big exception is <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>, as the mechanisms for controlling software different than those controlling RPGs. (You can, for example, make software expire, a trick not really tolerated in the PDF world.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, the point here is that when customers sign on to a beta (whether voluntarily or paying for the "privilege"), there is a clear indication of the quality they can expect and what they are in for. This thread suggests that (right or wrong) that same expectation isn't universally held regarding ashcans.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231627/#Comment_231627" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T09:18:50+00:00" title="September 11, 2009  9:18AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>is there a point at which you're going to get past the explicit vocabulary stuff and actually respond to the legitimate concerns being raised about what you wrote in your original post?

I'll bite.</p>\n<p>Here's the idea. An ashcan is an unfinished game. If you sell it for money, this is what you are doing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are releasing an unfinished product that might not work properly.</li>\n<li>It might not even work <em>a little.</em><br>\n-There's no guarantee that you'll actually produce a finished product.</br></li>\n<li>You expect purchasers to supply <em>you</em> with development feedback, a privilege you made them <em>pay for.</em></li>\n<li>It's understood that this feedback is a necessary <em>but not sufficient</em> condition on your project's completion. There are no known sufficient conditions!</li>\n<li>In the event that you do, in fact, finish working on your thing, all those ashcans are rendered...trash.</li>\n<li>There's also no guarantee that the finished product, if it should occur, will actually be <em>better</em> than the ashcan.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sure, none of this is <em>illegal,</em> since it's ostensibly consensual. But I don't think that makes it <em>moral.</em> Frankly I feel that it's equivalent to (pretend it's 1960) selling transistor radio parts labelled "Computer Ashcan," and telling your customers that if they tinker around enough, they might be able to make it do math, and <em>if</em> one of your customers succeeds in doing that, then you get to take their design and make bucks off it. That's two rip-offs in a row.</p>\n<p>Finally, uh, I can say whatever I like to say. That's what the First Amendment is. If you don't like what I'm saying, there is no obligation for you to obey or even listen, but if it makes you uncomfortable or worried, then maybe ask yourself, "Hey, do I want people who think like Shreyas to be my customers?" If the answer is yes, then stop ripping people off.</p>\n<p>I've said it before and I'll say it again. I can't <em>make</em> you do what I want you to do, but (and even if I know you personally) I'm not going to pretend that I approve of business practices I find appalling. The other half of free speech is that, if you see a problem, it's your responsibility to speak out about it.

I tend to apply a SLIGHTLY different metric for Alpha/Beta:<br>* ST - System Test; really only applicable to modular or generic/universal systems; ready to play, but no guidance (maybe this is the "tools" stage of a computer product?)<br>* Alpha - Full system and playable content; in an RPG, that would mean all system components and enough of setting to get started.<br>* Beta - Full system, full (mostly) content; just looking for the silly shit; in RPGs, this is typos, weird tweaks to rule combinations, maybe points-cost balances.<br>* Gold Master - This Is What I'm Shipping--is it broke? (This would be a proof stage for a publication.)<br><br>I might be skewed some, though, because my system ins a generic one, intended for LARP. I'm at the stage where Unreal Editor is built and the core scriptable elements are all in it: it's no a "game" at all, because there's no levels, no goals, no story wrapper. And I want to hold there and let users play with the editor <i>because it's generic and must support as much as possible.</i> I would never claim it's "done", and I don't charge for it because I want folks to stress test it and, as such, I want them to be fully aware that it could break under the load.<br><br>Anyhow... very interesting assessment--how else do you think RPG text and related products might differ from software in development and lifecycle management?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231675/#Comment_231675" name="Item_118" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T10:14:12+00:00" title="September 11, 2009 10:14AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hoho</cite>You expect purchasers to supply <em>you</em> with development feedback, a privilege you made them <em>pay for.</em></blockquote>\nI'm tired of this argument. As has been said, printing costs money, as does traveling to cons to distribute the booklet. What's wrong with a designer covering their costs?<br><br/>It would be one thing if the designer had some sort of guarantee that the customer/playtester would provide feedback, but they don't. As has also been said, designers don't always hear back from their customers. Rob said he even had to hound people to get feedback.<br/><br/>Since the customer/playtester gets to walk away with a physical object---whether workable or broken, it doesn't matter---and without any binding responsibility to even read the book, let alone play and give feedback, it seems completely reasonable that they should cover the production &amp; distribution costs.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231684/#Comment_231684" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T10:35:15+00:00" title="September 11, 2009 10:35AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Hey Judd, let's talk about medium vs. message.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Go fuck a pig.</p>\n<p>Maybe your time would be better spent copulating with a sow.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>See, now, both of these suggestions <em>mean</em> the same thing, but they use <em>different words.</em> One of them uses swears, and the other is just rude.

There are no known sufficient conditions!In the event that you do, in fact, finish working on your thing, all those ashcans are rendered...trash.There's also no guarantee that the finished product, if it should occur, will actually be<em>better</em>than the ashcan.Sure, none of this is<em>illegal,</em>since it's ostensibly consensual. But I don't think that makes it<em>moral.</em>Frankly I feel that it's equivalent to (pretend it's 1960) selling transistor radio parts labelled "Computer Ashcan," and telling your customers that if they tinker around enough, they might be able to make it do math, and<em>if</em>one of your customers succeeds in doing that, then you get to take their design and make bucks off it.

I would certainly *appreciate* feedback, and I'll ask for that.<br/><br/>Beyond that, I'm asking for a paltry sum of money as an indicator of genuine interest and good faith.  <br/><br/>If you aren't interested, or don't think that's fair, well.... don't give me 5 bucks.  In the unlikely case that you do have genuine interest in my game, but are too strapped for cash or philosophically opposed or whatever to pay me, well, make the case.  Show me your interest, and I'll probably hand you the  game.  The $5 bucks obviously matters less to me than it does to you.<br/><br/>In fact, I've already done that - I just didn't think it was worth mentioning.  There's several copies of Reality Cops that went to people who have expressed interest from the beginning way back when, or who have done so somewhere along the line.<br/><br/><br/>James                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231711/#Comment_231711" name="Item_132" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T11:26:13+00:00" title="September 11, 2009 11:26AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well we can use the Ashcan Front definition for a starting point for conversations about what an ashcan is or should be and that would be an awesome conversation to have. I guess what I was saying is that I feel like one of the many reasons this conversation we are having right now is fucked is because there is no <i>clear</i> definition. I mean, if someone made a totally half-baked game and sold it for money and called it an ashcan, could you say, "No, that's not really an ashcan." I'm not saying the definition is meaningless or all-inclusive, but that it's very unspecific.<br/><br/>And so what I think is that throwing the concept of ashcans in the ashcan where they're a totally nebulous thing may not be the best idea, and I'm speaking as someone averse to the idea as a consumer and a wannabe designer. What I wish is that these conversations could happen without lines being drawn and it turning into a big shitstorm, because I think ashcans do some good things but I think they also have problems, and I think a conversation that turns into "pro-ashcan" or "anti-ashcan" is going to be about fighting, and not solving those problems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231712/#Comment_231712" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T11:30:17+00:00" title="September 11, 2009 11:30AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2009 11:33AM by Bret_Gillan.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ken Sentowski!</cite>You are using a relativistic argument that will just go in circles and circles and circles...

Some folks took part as consumers and contributors and others did not.  Either way, some neat games are coming out/have come out due to the efforts of the Ashcan Front.<br/><br/>The Ashcan Front was founded after a year at Gen Con when lots of games came out of the Forge Booth that appeared to be half-baked.  Rather than bitch and moan about it, Paul and Matt decided to take action.

None of the above definitions reference cost, do they?<br/><br/>Quality is orthogonal--1909, quality was in "the eye of the beholder" like any art, but it was presumably a primary goal of its creators; 1939, quality was meaningless, they were putting out a few pages to stake out turf; 2007, quality was antithetical, the aesthetic was supposed to be bare bones, just the RAW, with no production value (probably the better to control costs and very clearly convey that, no, this ain't a completely polished, top-quality mainstream game, kid).<br/><br/>Subjectivism in language is the death of communication. There's reasons we invent "dictionaries" and "encyclopedias."<br/><br/>All that said... if you're making something that doesn't fit Ashcan School, Ashcan Copy, or Ashcan, then don't use the word. At all. Borrow a term from computer science, like System Test Document (30%ish), Alpha Test Document (50%ish), Beta Test Rules (75%ish) or Gold Master Candidate (99%ish). And then, of course, DEFINE that right on the cover and back cover, maybe even with a watermark on each page (watermarks scream "not done yet").<br/><br/>Hope this helps the conversation... if there's any of one left.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231731/#Comment_231731" name="Item_139" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T11:52:21+00:00" title="September 11, 2009 11:52AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, the Ashcan Front definition you referenced (but not your paraphrasing) does specifically mention cost.

And then decide if I want to buy them, knowing in advance what the holes are, or to wait for the revision. OR, to be pleasantly surprised, and learn out these are working games, and spend money on them.<br/><br/>And NO, this is not what the ashcan booth did. This behaviour is not the result of the ashcan booth, the ashcan booth is the result of others feeling like I do.<br/><br/>And yes, Nathan, to me, all games published are suspect. If I buy a new game when it comes out, it's either that I'm willing to bet on the designer's record, or I must have the new hawtness so much that I'm driven out of my senses, temporarily.<br/>Face it. Crap games are made. And as a result, I treat all games as potentially crap.<br/><br/>Then again, I also know with each new book that I pick up, that I might find it to be unadulterated crap. Which is why I so often pick up books I've read before, when I want to read something that I know is good.<br/><br/>The floodgates?

Positives and negatives.<br/><br/>Graham</blockquote>\nPeople were charging money for unfinished games and game products long before the Ashcan Front. The difference is, the Ashcan Front invited designers to actually recognize that their games were not quite ready yet, and invited consumers to take seriously the task of helping to get the game ready. And we have direct personal-experience posts in this thread to support the notion that in some cases, it has worked. We also have some direct-experience cases of people who've shared that they think their game sales have been in some way harmed by the existence of ashcans. But the people who took a good idea and used it in good faith and to good effect are being lumped in with a theoretical cabal of asshats who have abused the process, and  all of them are being called thieves or are being held responsible for lost sales.<br/><br/>It simply doesn't track.<br/><br/>But in the end, the fact remains - Yes, Graham, if you want to put out a game you came up with a week ago and call it an ashcan and charge people for it - YOU CAN. Because no one has the right to tell you not to. They can critique it, try to talk you out of it, beg you to reconsider, and yeah, they *can* even accuse you of being a dirty thief (although IMO taking the "dirty thief" route is not going to get you or your accusers anywhere in terms of having a reasoned debate). But you CAN release your game as an ashcan. You can even release it as a final edition if you want to. And you can do whatever you want with the design and layout, whatever you want with the cover art, the binding, the quality, the quantity, the price, and the method of getting it into peoples' hands. Now and forever. Because you're the creator-publisher and it is your game. And some of the people who sweated and clawed and put their asses on the line to help pioneer a milieu in which you or I or anyone else CAN do that, they are some of the people who've been accused of ripping people off here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231783/#Comment_231783" name="Item_144" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T12:51:38+00:00" title="September 11, 2009 12:51PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, fuck <i>off</i>.<br/><br/>This is quite liberating, actually.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231790/#Comment_231790" name="Item_145" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T13:02:44+00:00" title="September 11, 2009  1:02PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Hey Keith, language.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20Aidley" title="Jack Aidley"><img alt="Jack Aidley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20Aidley">Jack Aidley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231791/#Comment_231791" name="Item_146" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T13:05:42+00:00" title="September 11, 2009  1:05PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>I actually love the idea of ashcans, as enshrined in that definition.

They're going out of their way to reduce buyer's remorse and bring some clarity to the status of their project - they may even be guided by their desire not to sell under false pretenses because, you know, that would be immoral, and they're basically good people.<br/><br/>Or, you know, maybe the people around you here are just a pack of theives, and you're the proper judge and guardian of morals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231801/#Comment_231801" name="Item_150" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T13:22:57+00:00" title="September 11, 2009  1:22PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Um, did I miss the post where someone who actually bought an ashcan felt actually ripped off?

unfinished games all the time, and it's not an immoral transaction.<br/><br/>One of the best RPG purchases I ever made was of a PDF that was clearly some guy's d20 campaign notes typed up and illustrated with crap he scanned out of his Trapper Keeper.  Got it for $2.<br/><br/>The price was right for a complete unorganized mess, with random tables stuck in silly places and crazy ideas overflowing.<br/><br/>I wasn't cheated even though it was the very epitome of bad and unfinished.  I MORE than got my $2 worth out of this dude's fairytale airship swashbuckling D&amp;D notes.<br/><br/>Because it was useful to me.  That's the only thing that matters.  Is the product <i>useful</i> enough to justify its price?<br/><br/>For many products, ashcan or not, the answer is no, and that's a bad deal.<br/>For many products, ashcan or not, the answer is yes, and that's a good deal.<br/><br/>Fuck if the game is "finished" or not, fuck the "designer intent" in getting playtest feedback or whatever, nobody cares what the designer thinks or intends ever.  The only question is "is it useful?"  Can you use what you buy in some way?<br/><br/>If I buy a game for $3 and 40 pages of it are awful and I'll never use it, but 5 pages are really good and useful in many gaming situations, I might consider that a good purchase even though "the game" can't be said to be good or finished.  If it cost $40, I might not consider that a good purchase.  Everyone's going to have some price point they like.<br/><br/>This is the only method of thinking about RPG purchases that makes any sense, given the social realities of gaming.<br/><br/>Playtesting, whether paid or not, is a different beast entirely. This is just about the purchase of a product.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MickBradley" title="MickBradley"><img alt="MickBradley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.canonpuncture.com/wp-content/uploads/mick-blackhat1001.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MickBradley">MickBradley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231813/#Comment_231813" name="Item_152" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T13:35:27+00:00" title="September 11, 2009  1:35PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2009 1:37PM by MickBradley.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for actually supporting your accusations, Shreyas.

I did it because I fully understood, supported, and respected the concept and was happy to opt in. \n<blockquote><ul><li>In the event that you do, in fact, finish working on your thing, all those ashcans are rendered...trash.</li></ul></blockquote>\nI assure you, I do not even remotely consider my hand-made copy of <i>The Fisherman's Wife</i> trash, and I never will no matter what future copy I might obtain. And I still have and still appreciate my ashcan copy of <i>A Penny for My Thoughts</i>. Do I use them in play? No, but that doesn't render them useless as art, or as a statement of passionate creation, or as tangible artifacts of the creator-owned publishing aesthetic. It's sad that you think of them as trash. You are obviously really pissed off about all this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231815/#Comment_231815" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T13:36:19+00:00" title="September 11, 2009  1:36PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>The price was right for a complete unorganized mess, with random tables stuck in silly places and crazy ideas overflowing.</blockquote>Show of hands: Who owns HOL?

It's unforgiveable.Half of these games are well-nigh unplayable, and sure we know you're excited, and sometimes you get<em>over</em>excited and do some insane arts-and-crafts project which involves blinging out your ashcan to some ridiculous degree. This, too, is unacceptable. Putting lipstick on a pig.Go back to the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashcan_copy" rel="nofollow">roots of ashcans</a>and stop robbing friends and strangers.

Has someone published a non-functional draft of a game and called it an "ashcan"? Has someone gotten around to the finished product and managed to make something worse than the ashcan? I'm seeing a lot of indictments of sloppy game design and questionable publishing practices, but nothing that really relates to ashcans in particular, least of all (to the best of my knowledge) as they've emerged in practice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10392/ashcans-belong-in-the-ashcan/p3" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10392/ashcans-belong-in-the-ashcan">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10392/ashcans-belong-in-the-ashcan/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10392/ashcans-belong-in-the-ashcan/p3" rel="prev">3</a><a class="Highlight p-4 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10392/ashcans-belong-in-the-ashcan/p4">4</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F10392%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F10392%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
