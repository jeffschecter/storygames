There will be 7-ish tables outside the game library. Gencon staff will also arrange for a table for generic tickets if available. <br/><br/>This is the least space for free open gaming since I've been going to Gencon. Given the communication I've seen I can easily see even less open gaming in the future. Gencon staff does not see it as useful or even understandable. <br/><br/>I can see coordinating with staff to get overflow tables if we are really rocking at Games on Demand. We definitely need to keep that in mind. <br/><br/>Its just sad to me though.  We used to run an entire mini-Ambercon in the sea of open gaming tables at MECA. No one cared as long as there was room to play.  Now they are incredulous that you'd use any space without registering. <br/><br/>Dang. I need to sleep and stop stewing about this. <br/><br/>Goodnight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336221/#Comment_336221" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-28T06:42:13+00:00" title="July 28, 2011  6:42AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The loss of the 3rd floor Hyatt is a bit of a downer. That was a nice space. Although it is less of a loss and more of a relocation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven't seen the new space outside the game library but that's a great location for Open Gaming. Close to the rest of Gen Con, and you can borrow games to play! Sounds like a potential win.<br/>\n<br/>\nOpen Gaming isn't going away but they are making it clearer how they want Open Gaming to be used. Which may conflict with how many have used it. What does Gen Con want?<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like Gen Con wants Open Gaming to be as "open" as possible. Meaning they want it in an accessible, easily found area where anyone can jump into a game. Moving Open Gaming to outside the library helps achieve this. There is less space but Games on Demand is simultaneously expanding and there are plenty of unofficial open areas all over the convention and the surrounding hotels. I know people who play entire campaigns in hotel lobbies with chairs much more comfortable than anything Gen Con could reasonably offer. Also, the exhibit hall side tables are great for Open Gaming! I've played / run entire 4 hour games a few feet away from our favorite gaming booths. The acoustics are surprisingly reasonable. So what doesn't Gen Con want?<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like Gen Con doesn't want Open Gaming tables to be monopolized by 1 group for 4 days (although they don't have any rules, new or old, to prevent this) and they don't want Open Gaming used for scheduled events that are not open to the public.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut event submission is still open! I've seen people on Gen Con's forums recommend submitting games right now, setting the minimum players to 2-4 (so the game is open to the public), and leaving unofficial slots open for your friends as co-GMs / NPCs / unofficial players. And Gen Con would give you dedicated space. Plus as mentioned above, beyond official Open Gaming, there is a lot of space available for unofficial open gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336223/#Comment_336223" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-28T06:48:45+00:00" title="July 28, 2011  6:48AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            According to the Gen Con forum moderators, if a group of friends want to play an unscheduled game together and they can't find space, they can go to HQ and ask for a table as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336248/#Comment_336248" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-28T10:07:27+00:00" title="July 28, 2011 10:07AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Understanding the cost of putting on GENCON, this isn't a surprise.
