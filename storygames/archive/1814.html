                    I'm curious if any of you have studied improv (on stage or though books) and how it related to your approach to game design, not necessarily your approach to role-playing.<br/><br/>I've been doing some reading on the topic, and I keep running into familiar concepts like "advancing the scene" and "raising the stakes" as well as references to things very close to "de-protagonization".  Which of course makes me think, "hmmm...."                </div>

                            Do a Topic search for "improv" to see some previous focused threads here at S-G.  <br/><br/>All three of us in my Monday group have taken improv classes and one is a local company member who performs all the time.  Basically it blew our minds.  It's huge in terms of actual play.  But be careful not to conflate "stakes" in improvisation with stakes in gaming, because they aren't really the same thing in my opinion.  Same with the orientation of conflict and agreement.  <br/><br/>In terms of design, I think I've learned a lot of interesting things from improvisation.  The biggest, the one that is already explicitly plugged into my next game, is mechanically rewarding reincorporation.                        </div>

                            I am interested about improv's application to RPGs (though I'm not really interested in improvisational theatre itself). I think the following Forge thread sparked my interest:
<blockquote><b><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=19767.0" rel="nofollow">[Drill/Microgame/Warmup] I'm Gonna Make You Awesome</a></b>:<br/>One of the central tenets to playing in scenes is that it is your core responsibility to make your fellow players look good.  If you are getting more laughs than they are, you are not trying hard enough.  When everybody is on the same page it reduces the pressure a lot, because you know that whatever dumb-ass move you make will be the best possible one to your team and they are there to pick you up and make you look fantastic.   </blockquote>
I know improv is probably not best learned from book learnin', but are there are stand-out books that would be applicable to RPG players? Keith Johnstone's "Impro for Storytellers" seems to be out-of-print on Amazon.com, but they have                        </div>

<i>Impro </i>and <i>Impro for Storytellers</i> are really good for gamers, particularly the latter.  There was a book club thread on <i>Impro </i>here a while back.  <br/><br/>Anecdotally, <i>I'm Gonna Make You Awesome</i> is easier in theory than in practice, but it is really nice when it works.  Of course you can and should internalize it and just do it, which is what improvisers do.  It's unspoken, you just make your partners rock out on stage whenever you can.                        </div>

                            I first got curious about this subject from listening to Jason talk about it on his podcast.  And my interest is mostly regarding how to encourage more and better roleplaying in short form games that one might play at a con or as one-shots with strangers.  Especially GM-less games since they don't have someone whose vested interest is to move the story and the conflict forward.  And by a strange coincidence, I found that the Likes and Dislikes from The Shab-al-Hiri Roach did a really nice job of linking the characters together.  Whenever you were in a scene, you already had a solid reason to interact with certain people.  And things like enthusiasms in that game and traits in Dogs really fed into the narrative for me.  It's tough when you throw strangers together at a table and they have nothing to hold onto except their character sheet.<br/><br/>Perhaps my question could have been better stated as, "How can studying improv help game designers to encourage narrativist play in the games they create?"                        </div>

                            I studied theatre for about 10 years, and in that time had a vast improv life, studied in school and applied in practice. There were about four solid years in there where I had at least one improv show (sometimes as many as three)  that went live on stage on a weekly basis. Some were improv comedy, some serial dramas, some "soaps". They had a vast impact on my understanding of human dynamics and the choreography of social groups. They are also, incidentally, what brought me back to gaming. <br/><br/>Because of the timing involved (there was that wide body of theatre experience followed by a wide body of play experience, followed by a much smaller body of design experience, the interim of which spans ten years) it's hard to pick out what specifically one has done to the other, however I'm certain that experience informs everything I do in game design, game play and frequently,<i> in life.</i> </div>

                            I am not the least interested in impro or theatre as such, but in using the ideas or techniques from these media in fiction games where possible. I thought I should buy one of the impro books - Jason recommends Impro for Storytellers as particularly good, Joe Prince the first Impro book, so I am not sure. I am curious: there is a chapter called Story Games in Impro for Storytellers - what's that about? Sounds like word games and small drills.<br/><br/>I suppose we are talking about techniques to use both as player and player with GM responsibilities, as well as a designer, right? Or is there even more to it?<br/><br/>Per                        </div>
