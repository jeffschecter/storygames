We just had our one-year anniversary event which busted Ides open to a full game day, all in a series of steps leading to RinCon '08, a huge three-day gaming convention held in downtown Tucson. Here's the thing that I found really interesting: at the Ides event, we had a ton of role-playing events and almost all of them were story-game driven. If this holds true for RinCon '08 -- where I'm heading up the RPG track -- we'll have a massive SG presence at the con.<br/><br/>For the Ides event, we had approximately 50 attendees with around 36 people constantly in attendance at the game room. Normal Ides events tend to run 36 attendees with about 20-24 constantly in the game room. Normally we have either zero, one, or two RPG sessions going on at Ides (4 to 6 hours of gametime, when RPGs were run). This time, we had six RPG sessions scheduled to run for 22 hours of RPG goodness. Comparing to the scheduled boardgaming events, there was only 24 hours of boardgame gametime on the schedule. <br/><br/>Here's a quick breakdown of RPG games on the schedule:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6038" rel="nofollow">In A Wicked Age: Vista Heights</a> was up against InSpectres which posed a dilemma for me. On one hand, Jason Corley was running Vista Heights, so you know it is going to be a great game. Hell, Jason could run a game of Candyland and it would be the Capital-A Awesome. On the other hand, I really wanted to play InSpectres and was in the mood for something a bit lighter than gritty crime drama. I wound up playing InSpectres and had the funnest game session of the year. I'll rave about the game later.<br/><br/>Long Live The King went off against Call of Cthulhu. Both tables filled the seats, so there were two game organizers running twelve or thirteen players. I ran LLTK, White Wolf's guided LARP/card game with role-playing/How To Host A Murder mashup. The game was pretty good, but required more prep time than was necessary -- in order to get first time players ready for the game, I had to create cheat sheets that should have been included in the game. There also is a game mechanic that throws players in the Dungeon, but don't worry, says the book, "it's totally easy to get out of the Dungeon". Lies. The Royal Bastard sat out of the game for the last four turns of a seven turn game as he was constantly denied release. That one player had No Fun, and the game soured in my mind because of that*. A quick house rule should have been in order; if I play that game again, we'll make sure that doesn't happen again.<br/><br/>Red Box Hack was scheduled to happen, but didn't go as crowds started to thin out in the slot. I really wanted to play, but due to the scheduling, it was up against Zombie Survivor. I sat in on <a href="http://unclebear.com/" rel="nofollow">Uncle Bear's</a> playtest of Toybox Wars (which we were calling Godzilla Deathrace 2000), where Jason's Godzilla toy laid waste to all of the other player's Chinese Defense Forces. (Our plastic Army Men were made in China.) Time was up and we had to get started on my Primetime Adventures game, Zombie Survivor, which completely rocked. There's a good chance we're going to do that as a series at our monthly Ides of Gaming events. As our show (ZURVIVOR) is a reality tv competition show, if you show up, it's easy to drop you in as a contestant in the survivor's camp on Zombie Island, competing for the Grand Prize. ZURVIVOR: Outrun, Outfight, Outlive. A Golden Production.<br/><br/>You'll notice that not a single game of D&amp;D was run (even though we had one of the RPGA members in town show up to the event). We're probably going to get more D&amp;D action after 4th Edition launches, but I'd like to keep the Story Game momentum rolling through to RinCon '08 and making that con a Story Games Mecca.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* He actually had Fun because he got into a game of Ca$h 'n Gun$ during the last two turns of LLTK and hung out with other gamers while in the Dungeon, but still.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135232/#Comment_135232" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-17T12:42:46+00:00" title="March 17, 2008 12:42PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="image" src="http://cobweb.scarymonsters.net/~corleyj/images/macro/best_picture_ever.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135385/#Comment_135385" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-18T10:38:53+00:00" title="March 18, 2008 10:38AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sorry I missed it!
