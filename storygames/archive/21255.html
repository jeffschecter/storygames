While, I've put it on the back burner for sometime while I finish the current Story Game I'm working on, I still think about it once in a while and do a little work on it. In truth, it is a mixture of this type of RPG and a Story Game. With it being a GMfull game, I'm looking at ways to do small amounts of group prep/setup so that everyone has an idea of the general situation in which the story takes place or could be explored. I think that this might be comparable to Fronts, maps, or the like in PbtA games; although, I've never read one of these games all the way through so I'm not sure. My game is a play to find out game or a story now game so the prep shouldn't be much but it should get all the GM's on the same page enough to make give folks a somewhat unified vision of the Story setup. How do people deal with this when they play GMfull/GMless Monsterhearts or the like? I know GMfull games aren't in vogue, but how did/do they deal with this issue? With a lot of different auteurs handling things like the necessity of enemies with stats and the like and other things they don't come in GMless game story game, what are the best ways to deal with this kind of stuff?  Perhaps during set up create a map, Fronts(?), NPCs and NPC motives, organizations and organizational motives\u2014Fronts are challenges to face in the game, are they not? Correct me if I'm wrong. Anyway, if you could provide any information about how other games deal with this or procedures that you think would be work, I would very much appreciate it.

Historical background with fantasy elements that are pulled out of folklore and mythologies of the various religions and cultures that populate the world between Vikings and the Caliphate of the Arabs.<br/><br/>I envision that there will be a map and lots of details that are organically created during play. Best thing would be that everything is created during play with both random generation (strongly setting-oriented one) and player input, so that we have an organic world that breathes and starts to develop as the characters roam around the world in their adventures etc.<br/><br/>My idealistic vision is that there would be no game master but I am faced with the same dilemma: people have varying grasp of the Dark Ages and the myths, how to validate input from different players.<br/><br/>One idea I have is that the rest of the group has a veto on any given player input based on how the idea fits the world that is being played out. If, for example, all players want that Slav tribesmen ride unicorns then who am I to block them, but if such an entry is to be forbidden then it is the responsibility of the group to discuss it out.<br/><br/>The worst case scenario in this is that the play deteriorates into endless debates, but so far I haven't been able to figure out a better way to do this. Unless I give up and introduce GM back to the equation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465633/#Comment_465633" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-15T14:11:07+00:00" title="August 15, 2017  2:11PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 15, 2017 2:12PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks everyone! <br/><br/>Paul, I would be very down to play that game online. <br/><br/>Rafu, thanks for clearing up Fronts for me; they sound much more useful now.

Sort of like "story game" in that regard [grin].</p></div></blockquote>\n"Story Game" as a term is being used the way I use it more and more; in fact, it's rare that it's being used in other ways, at least in the broad sense of how I use it. I think it is not being used in the original sense that <del>Ron coined </del> (edit: in the "any RPG" sense that Andy(?) or whoever coined) hardly at all anymore and is now being almost exclusively used in the way that Ben and I use it.  For example, look at the types of games that are calling themselves Story Games that are being published now; they almost without exception fit my broader definition, and usually fit Ben's technical definition. I would know, I buy all of them haha <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/>. I would argue that is a useful term (as to whether it stands up to scrutiny, I guess it depends on what your definition of scrutiny is and in what context you're talking about). I would remind folks that people also disagree about the definition of an RPG. The meaning of "Story Game," although diverse is cohering, and is becoming used in a more specific way and is being used more and more to describe games like those that Ben and I have argued the term should describe. I have argued for using the term this way because I think it makes the term most useful. I think Ben wanted a precise definition, so maybe that was his reasoning, you'd have to ask him.  My point is that it is being used in this specific way, more and more in its popular use, and most of the games which now describe themselves by the term fit that definition.<br/><br/>This is how I define them technically (Ben's definition); see the defintion here: <br/><a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/460/defining-story-games/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/460/defining-story-games/</a><br/><br/>This is how I define them more broadly. While a more loose definition, it is valuable and has flexibility; also, the broader definition does not make the technical definition moot:  <br/><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2016/01/12/what-is-a-storygame/amp/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/amp/s/heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2016/01/12/what-is-a-storygame/amp/</a><br/><br/>Again, the term story game lacks pure consensus and perfect precision, but so does the term RPG. All this said, there are some people that I highly respect who don't find the term useful. For example, I don't think Jason  finds the term useful and he's the designer  of the best story game that I know of\u2014so I could definitely be wrong haha <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465674/#Comment_465674" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-16T23:08:08+00:00" title="August 16, 2017 11:08PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nothing in particular to add, except that Ron Edwards didn't coin "story game". There are a few different origin accounts, but probably the most pertinent and well attested one is that Andy needed a name for this forum, chose "Story Games" (probably inspired by one of the other obscure antecedents), and from there the term was adopted into a vague appellation for "the kinds of roleplaying games that we like". Because this forum was basically started as a more relaxed alternative to Forge (alternative as in an alternate environment for the same people, not as in replacing the functions of the Forge), this "the games we like" originally pretty much meant the sorts of games that were in the vogue at the Forge.<br/><br/>For the longest time it was common to call "the games we like" (or don't like, in the case of people who disliked the design trends in question) with the appellation "indie game" despite the constant reminders from all sorts of annoyingly staid community figures that "indie" does not, in fact, tell you anything about the creative content of the game. After the Forge was closed down it's become more popular to say "story game", probably because this forum became the de facto highest-profile trademark for this subscene.<br/><br/>Due to this historical background, the term "story game" tends to be more of a cultural shibboleth than a term of analysis, most of the time when people use it: you call something a "story game" to say that it belongs in a certain subcultural tradition. Substance doesn't really come to it, and while people try to derive a surface meaning from the idea of "story", that doesn't really get you far - pretty much all rpgs have "story".<br/><br/>I don't mind appropriating the term for a more precise purpose, of course. You like the sound of it, go ride that horse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465675/#Comment_465675" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-16T23:55:47+00:00" title="August 16, 2017 11:55PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2017 1:16AM by Jeff_Slater.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Eero, I must have remembered wrong.

They know the background of the term and how it was used and so they see it as more ambiguous than it is being used now. I think most of the games that label themselves Story Games now have a number of shared defining <a href="http://www.google.com/amp/s/heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2016/01/12/what-is-a-storygame/amp/" rel="nofollow">traits</a>.

Perhaps they figure in as hybrids, but with much more in common w traditional RPGs.<br/><br/>If a GM is defined as a single central narrator with adjudication duties (for the sake of this argument), it becomes easier to TRY to split RPGs across a divide of "with GM" and "without GM" and you may very well see a traditional/story split that would answer to the language use and sentiment and "gut feel" of 99% of gamers.

(Or Robbins makes some points about character skills, do-overs, and narration, but really that's just going to put games on a broad continuum with high crunch simulators at one end, and pure narration PC success at the other, and no hard breaks in between at all.) <br/><br/>Ergo, my stab at a definition is holding up okay.<br/><br/>*****<br/><br/>For definitions which I think ARE useful..<br/><br/>I think a super useful approach to basic game design philosophy which doesn't need definitions of games is the MDA game theory. Instead of categorizing games by "type" you end up looking at what players in games are going to be able to do, and what they will be able to experience. It also would help game designers to be able to think in terms of how different players and play groups might use the same game to have a distinctly different and customized experience.<br/><br/>If no one has read it:<br/><br/><a href="http://theangrygm.com/gaming-for-fun-part-1-eight-kinds-of-fun/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://theangrygm.com/gaming-for-fun-part-1-eight-kinds-of-fun/</a><br/><br/>Agree or disagree with him on many points, but I think the points he makes here are amazingly useful from a design standpoint.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465684/#Comment_465684" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-17T03:15:34+00:00" title="August 17, 2017  3:15AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, interesting! I had no idea that was what you meant by "GMfull" versus "GMless". Good to know, and a good reminder to define ambiguous terms when starting a conversation (it's also a great way to avoid debate!).<br/><br/>As for "story game", I agree that we don't need to have the discussion yet again (nothing wrong with each person using their preferred definition, so long as they remember to let us know what that is each time they want to start a conversation defined by those terms). <br/><br/>Two things, however:<br/><br/>1. The reason you might be thinking about Ron Edwards is because, at some point, he dropped the term "RPG" and started calling his games "Story Now Games". That's pretty close to "story game", but comes from a different place. The term "story game" itself, as far as I know, originated as a reference to this forum.<br/><br/>2. One reason many people don't find a more restrictive definition of "story game" useful is because there is a very, very large fraction of internet gamers which find games like, say, Apocalypse World to be far too "story-ish" for their tastes. It's possible that these people form a majority or significant minority of gamers, so they will certainly get their back up against the wall if you propose that Fiasco is a "story game" but Apocalypse World is a proper/traditional/normal RPG (e.g. most people in the OSR). On the other hand, people who love GMed RPGs but need some "modern design sensibility" in there (e.g. PbtA, Burning Wheel, etc) will also hate being lumped in with D&amp;D grognards (this is many/most "indie gamers" of a decade ago). <br/><br/>Once you combine these groups, it's believable that you get into a use of a term which doesn't make sense the way you use it for a majority of gamers. That will get you some push-back!<br/><br/>Now, about the GMless/GMful divide you (Jeff) have described: is there any particular design feature or characteristic which separates them? Is it the level of collaboration involved, authority used, or mechanical design?<br/><br/>For greater clarity (if you're interested in such), the term "round robin GMing" or "rotating GM game" used to be in vogue for what you're calling "GMful". Those are nice terms in that they are fairly self-explanatory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465685/#Comment_465685" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-17T03:23:08+00:00" title="August 17, 2017  3:23AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2017 4:07AM by Jeff_Slater.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM">@Mongrel_GM</a> <br/>This is what Ben perceives the real difference to be:<br/><b><i>"In a story game, a player\u2019s ability to affect what happens in the game is not dependent on their character\u2019s fictional ability to do those things.<br/><br/>I\u2019d argue that\u2019s the defining trait.

But making it work right is fairly tricky, indeed; there aren't all that many great models. (<i>Polaris</i> is the main one, I'd argue.)<br/><br/>* Collaborative GMless play is quite "en vogue" right now, but, in many cases, it is a little bit of a "cheat", much like Rule Zero-style GMing in traditional games.<br/><br/>If you're a designer, it's a lot easier to write a workable and inspiring "collaborative GMless" game, because designs doing that tend to simply offload most of the difficulties of play into the social layer.<br/><br/>For example, is Fiasco GMful or GMless? Arguably, it's GMless, but many people play it GMful (at least as far as the player portraying their character is concerned). The game itself is fairly silent on the matter, and expects you, as a group, to negotiate your own way to a functional mode of play.<br/><br/>There's nothing wrong with this... but it is a very convenient way to avoid a lot of hard design questions: "Just make stuff up together and agree on it. Be nice to each other."<br/><br/>It's sort of the modern version of the traditional games which said to us: "Hey, here are the rules, but sometimes they won't work. If you don't like them, change them, or let the GM just decide what happens!" (aka Rule Zero)<br/><br/>In other words, you don't need to design a lot of these interactions in this currently-fashionable style of play: you can just ask the players to do it themselves, at the table.<br/><br/>This is no particular crime (although it has driven a lot of people away from this kind of play, as well), and I think we will continue to get better and better at writing, designing, and explaining this kind of gaming. However, I would also guess that it is at least partially responsible for the current "fashion" of designing such freeform, collaborative games - it's much easier to do than more procedural design, and so we see a real wave of these games coming out. It sets a low bar for designers, and so more games written in this way reach completion and get published.<br/><br/>Just a guess on my part, of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM" title="Mongrel_GM"><img alt="Mongrel_GM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM">Mongrel_GM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465688/#Comment_465688" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-17T04:20:41+00:00" title="August 17, 2017  4:20AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps it's for another thread, but the more applicable game theory has to do with aesthetics/experience.

Designers can drill down into greater depth for any of the 8 aesthetics at need, but the theory doesn't crop up with inconsistencies or need for special rules, because it all has to do with ways individual players can interact with the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465689/#Comment_465689" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-17T04:23:35+00:00" title="August 17, 2017  4:23AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2017 4:42AM by Jeff_Slater.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul,<br/>Hmm...I possibly see things a bit differently\u2014you'll have to let me know :-) These GMless collaborative games are my bread and butter, and what I would say is that it sets the bar low if your design is mediocre. I actually think that designing a collaborative GMless game well is probably harder than designing any other type of RPG. It seems easy on first appearances but to do it well is actually hard as hell. The truth is that most of these games are not what they could be, even games that I advocate for. There are only a few whose designs are truly excellent. I would put Fiasco in this category. We have never had a failed game at SG SLC; however, this is with the caveat that we always play it with my "house rule" interpretation we've talked about (i.e. a character's goals or what they want in a scene is always seen from the characters' limited perspective\u2014that is what equals good versus bad for the character, is what they want vs what they don't want, always). And we all know how good Fiasco characters are at making good decisions ;-)<br/><br/>Anyway, I really think that designing a collaborative GMless game well, is hard as hell to do. Just my 2 cents :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465690/#Comment_465690" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-17T04:30:35+00:00" title="August 17, 2017  4:30AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM" rel="nofollow">Mongrel_GM</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Perhaps it's for another thread...</p></div></blockquote>\nDefinitely start another thread about it, it is a topic people like to discuss and it will get buried here.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465693/#Comment_465693" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-17T05:22:10+00:00" title="August 17, 2017  5:22AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the clarification.

I'd love to discuss it further with you (probably outside the context of this thread, unless you say otherwise).<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I think Fiasco is definitely one of the best games in this genre (and arguably started it!). However, it has a notoriously high failure rate. Anecdotally, it's about 50% (among my friends and acquaintances) and I've never managed to have a good game of it myself. (Including two complete train wreck failures.)<br/><br/>People are very hesitant to critique a popular game online, so it's not a popular point of view, but I find that in private conversations many (most?) gamers agree with that experience, and we've had a few threads to that effect here on Story Games as well.<br/><br/>It becomes  very difficult to separate player skill or group dynamics from game design in such a case (highly freeform design), so discussing it is difficult. You have an unusually good perspective on this due to your club's nature, however, which is pretty cool - a better point of comparison than most.<br/><br/>Having said all that, I don't think there's necessarily anything wrong with games that are challenging to play; that's a valid approach to design, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465711/#Comment_465711" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-17T16:55:03+00:00" title="August 17, 2017  4:55PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2017 5:19PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've heard of people having trouble and I think it comes from two things. <br/><br/>First, if you do what is best for your character from your player's perspective the game will absolutely fail. (That is, if what is "good" for your character is chosen from your players perspective). You are wise and a Fiasco character shouldn't be. A white dice should cause as much of a mess as a black because what is good for your unwise character (from their perspective) with poor impulse control should actually be horrible for them and everyone else most of the time. I do agree that clarifying how one decides what is good or bad for a Fiasco character is the one area of the game that could have been done better (again with the caveat that it is the best designed story game I've personally ever played). Of course, I've always played it with my house rule (because this seemed obvious to me) and maybe that's why it's been so successful. <br/><br/>Second, I think that sometimes people don't understand how a Coen brothers movie works and don't know how to make one happen or maybe even how to appreciate one. I often find that people from other countries than the US have problems making Fiasco work.  And sometimes I think it has something to do with not understanding the Coen-esque nature of it.<br/><br/>Those are my thoughts on it. I do think that as long as you employ my "house-rule" and have an idea of what a Coen brothers movie is like,  your failure rate should be extremely low or nonexistent.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is the game we should play while  Jonathan is away! We've been talking about playing it with my "house-rule" for a long time and I want to show you the light baby, haha <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/> We should find out when everybody has some time.

I can't think of a rule that holds a candle to it, maybe in any game anywhere.<br/><br/>Having played 3 times with scenarios which were backdrops to where/who the action would involve but not necessarily the nature of the action (Suburbia, Aging Rock Band, Ghetto London) it's hard to say if my next observation is representative or not. I found that the first person to suggest something illegal decided (intentionally or not) the direction of 80% of the rest of the action. And in these games we got: small time burglary, small time burglary, and kidnapping. Sometimes the action wasn't super coherent, either. <br/><br/>However, these weaknesses I tend to attribute the mixed agenda of folks at the table, along with a taste for the over-the-top comedic. <br/><br/>My view is that as long as your PC has human foibles, maybe the more the better, as a player you can try to play the PC to "win" and it won't hurt the game at all. Can help drive the action. That stance roughly runs parallel to your viewpoint, Jeff, which is something we covered last Friday in the thread about 1st person immersion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465726/#Comment_465726" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-17T22:28:47+00:00" title="August 17, 2017 10:28PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM">@Mongrel_GM</a> <br/>I think that sometimes using the "win" terminology can be confusing to people.

Sorry Jeff.<br/><br/>Fiasco, to its credit, seems to allow for many play styles. I've never calculated trying to get a certain die in a scene nor strive for a certain mixture of dice by game's end. I just get into character and play. <br/><br/>"Win", "getting ahead", "achieve their goals" are all synonyms. If they all apply to the PC they are the same thing. If they all apply to player, they are the same thing.<br/><br/>"Trying to win" was introduced to me as a Fiasco talking point the first time I ever played. My PC didn't want to risk statutory rape with a high-schooler. So he didn't accept what was being offered until he saw photo ID (which ended up being fake). Late in the game he refused to empty his money out of an ATM at gun point, preferring death to that humiliation. When he only suffered a flesh wound he broke the face and other bones of the gunman. My PC was trying to "win," "get ahead," or otherwise "achieve his goals." A completely valid way to play Fiasco, as you've stated. However, others might have player strategies regarding dice and goals directed from a 3rd person perspective; I don't.<br/><br/>Would I like to see a happy ending, as player? Sure. I'm sympathetic to my character. An interesting bad end is exciting too. But I really start thinking of those game outcomes about the time we actually start rolling dice at the very end and doing the math.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465749/#Comment_465749" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-18T17:43:11+00:00" title="August 18, 2017  5:43PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Then how do you decide which die to take when you Resolve?

Just my 2 cents.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> <br/>I honestly think you are misunderstanding (?) Fiasco, or at least seeing it quite different than I do on a number of levels. What is good or bad for a character is not based on consensus, it is determined by the player playing that character. Consensus determines whether that outcome happens or not, but interpretation, whether bad or good, is determined by the player playing that given character. I think you are misunderstanding (?) other things as well\u2014misunderstanding is the wrong word and stronger than what I'm trying to say, but I can't think of the a more precise way to say it right now. I will go into this further when I have time and give examples. <br/><br/>Let me start by asking you a couple questions: <br/><br/>1. What would a successful Fiasco game look like to you? What type of story would it be?   What type of characters should it have?  What type a personality should they have in general?   How should the ending look, what would be a successful ending to you, generally?<br/><br/>2. What does it mean for something good or something bad to happen to one of the characters?<br/><br/>3. What should happen in the first act generally? And what should happen in the second generally? <br/><br/>I know these questions are wide open but give me your best answers if you have some time, feel like it, and are interested. You don't have to go into too much detail just give me the general direction and feel of things. Tone, themes, etc\u2026the big picture.

Think of Matthew McConaughey's character in Dazed and Confused but even more foolish. "I get older, they stay the same age," as the creepy dude says in the movie.<br/><br/>Star:<br/>Star is a young intelligent girl (17 years old) who is sort of a Juno punk rocker type but much smarter than Juno, probably too smart for her own good.<br/><br/>Ok, we start playing the scene. If the other players that aren't in the current scene want my character (Dufford) to get what he wants in the scene they will hold up a white die (i.e. "good" from my character's perspective), if they don't want Dufford to get what he wants they hold up a black die (i.e. "bad" from my character's perspective).<br/><br/>Dufford and Star are in Dufford's trailer. In the past Dufford and Star have used this trailer as their place to get it on. Dufford is trying to talk Star into getting it on (this is what Dufford wants from his perspective (i.e. what is "good" for him from his perspective...his limited, warped, foolish perspective)...<br/><br/>The group decides that Dufford doesn't get what he wants and holds up the black die. Me and the other player finish playing out the scene.<br/><br/>Dufford is trying to talk Star into it. But it's a set up. Star likes to sleep with older men and then extort them. Star says that not only is she not going to give Dufford what he wants but that Dufford is going to buy her a new iPhone and give her $300 dollars cash or she is going to tell her parents and the police. Dufford objects, Star makes it $600; she is in control and he is the sucker.<br/><br/>Now let's pretend that the group decided that Dufford did get what he wanted.<br/><br/>Dufford is trying to talk Star into getting busy. From Dufford's perspective he wants to get it on. Again this is what is "good" from his perspective; that is, what he wants (as dumb as it is)...<br/><br/>The group decides that Dufford gets what he wants and holds up the white die. Me and the other player play out the scene\u2014hopefully fading out to black before it gets creepier than it already is, haha.<br/><br/>What is the current situation? Dufford just comitted statutory rape. Star is in a messed up situation that probably won't go well for her. Dufford might get arrested or beat up by one of Star's brothers or friends.<br/><br/>The point is that when you play Fiasco with dumb, impulsive, ambitious characters that are willing to take big risks, which are the type of characters you're supposed to play Fiasco with (for the most part), what is "good" from the perspective of the characters is going to cause a horrible mess for them and everyone else because their extremely foolish. It doesn't really matter if the die is black or white, chaos and a Coen-esque story should typically ensue anyway. As long as you choose the right characters, try to make the story Coen-esque, and interpret "good" and "bad in this way\u2014and perhaps follow the advice of how Jason says to play act one and two\u2014I think you'll be able to have a successful game, likely with a great Coen-esque story. Let me know if you have any questions, or have some doubts, or whatever :-) Really, we just need to play the game, haha <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/>  :-)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM" title="Mongrel_GM"><img alt="Mongrel_GM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM">Mongrel_GM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465759/#Comment_465759" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-19T00:53:49+00:00" title="August 19, 2017 12:53AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Then how do you decide which die to take when you Resolve?

Other times it's just the next natural scene for the story, or at least next natural scene that my PC would be in. Once I learned I could let the other players set the scene and have more "free will" as my PC to get what he/she wants, I started using that.<br/><br/>Out of character I spent some effort in a few instances to keep players from overruling my PC's ability to make decisions. In all 3 games of Fiasco I've found my PC at the victim end of the actions of other PCs. That didn't really sit well with me as the player--although admittedly in Googling for answers on this I couldn't find any clarification. I have never read the rules. I also don't know how our house rules vary from RAW.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> I don't really see how you can make decisions about whether to agree with an outcome or not without taking story concerns into consideration.<br/><br/>What's that mental process like for you?</p></div></blockquote>\nI think I make my 3rd person narrative decisions from a standpoint of "what seems likely to really happen in this situation?" For me, an amazing and larger than life event in a book doesn't really amaze. I don't want a string of contrivances all aimed at outdoing the last amazing thing.

Of course, that sounds like all humans in the real world. That's fine for me. I don't know that these PCs had high ambition per se. <br/><br/>My first character came into the game having killed a neighbor in a DUI. He was a self serving alpha male, with a little bit of conscience. He was looking to clean up his act, but with his pride foremost that was no given. He let his violent side go when he felt justified to do so. <br/><br/>My second character had flimsy artistic pretenses, perhaps delusions of high talent. But the story didn't have much to do with music or rock bands, and he just ended up being kidnapped by NPCs. Weak story from his perspective.<br/><br/>My third character was looking for sexual adventure as escape from the boredom of a marriage for money. That played into the story a little, but mostly in setting up circumstances, not as a theme of the story itself. As a player, I felt I was needing to advocate for her free will to not just be a pawn in that game. It's kind of funny that Dizzie was perceived as a shallow character by most people at the table and dismissed in a cliche' way (art mirrors life?) In reality I thought she was a really deep and realistic character. <br/><br/>But I don't know if any of these 3 characters had "high ambition". Is that phrase in the rules?\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>It comes up when Establishing, too: I suppose in theory a player could always frame scenes for themselves in advantageous positions and then count on the other players to complicate things for them... but I've never seen a group actually do that.

Perhaps part of my player brain does, knowing that I don't want a boring cakewalk of a story. My PCs aren't looking to be heroes or anti-heroes. At any rate, complications certainly found my PCs without me looking for them (I think, I'm not a good judge of my subconscious). I'm not sure if I should have been looking for them.

However, I always welcome an opportunity to learn more, and this could be fruitful.<br/><br/>For instance, I've reviewed the rules text, which was interesting. (Your re-frame of die choice as being about character success, for example, is, I suspect, a very good way to approach Fiasco play. However, the text suggests the contrary - in one example, it specifies that a white die "means the character gets what they want <i>only if it is a positive outcome for the character</i>" (not verbatim, and emphasis mine). I like learning and discussing these little tweaks; sometimes they can be quite useful or insightful.)<br/><br/>Some brief answers:<br/><br/>1. If I think of models for a Fiasco game, the first two that come to mind are <i>Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels</i> (a very Fiasco movie) and the Fiasco episode of Tabletop.<br/><br/>I'd expect a story which puts more-or-less ordinary, relatable people getting in well over their heads - most likely because they make poor choices (due to poor impulse control and oversized ambitions) but possibly also because of desperation or because they get embroiled in events beyond their control. (Although I think the archetypal Fiasco character gets into trouble very much of their own volition; these are the exception.)<br/><br/>I'd expect things to develop fairly quickly and escalate beyond a typical situation of that sort, getting messier and messier with each new development.<br/><br/>The ending would be some mixture of dramatically appropriate and totally unexpected, as the Aftermath tables provide quite nicely - sometimes the people you cheer for find tragic ends, and both the underdogs and the extremely lucky tend to fare better. <br/><br/>I think a Fiasco ending is rarely all neat and tied up; instead, we get a variety of situations, with surprises and twists thrown in, and likely a good number of loose ends. It's not emotionally satisfying or predictable the way that, say, an epic fantasy story might be: there are shades of gray and both bad people who get what they deserve and good people who get thrown under the bus. There's probably a fair bit of cringing about these characters' fates.<br/><br/>2. I'm not sure what you mean by this question. According to whom? From what perspective? Are you talking about game mechanics?<br/><br/>3. I think that there's lots of room for playing against formula in a Fiasco story, but the archetypal format would be one which begins with an unstable situation, and a mix of characters who have oversized ambitions. In the first act, they make plans or jump on opportunities and start creating a big mess. <br/><br/>In the second act, the situation grows more complex and the characters are likely to resort to more dramatic or desperate means to get what they want: their plans don't go exactly as planned and things start to snowball out of control.<br/><br/>At the end, we see who comes out of it ahead and who drowns before they can escape from the mess.<br/><br/>Throughout, I would hope or expect to see characters making decisions which make sense from their perspective (keeping in mind their poor impulse control!), but are likely to end in disaster. ("Harold is going to go buy a gun and try to shoot his ex-wife at the Republican convention? Of course... he would totally do that. But, oh, man, there's no way that's going to end well for him!")<br/><br/>This is quite enjoyable as an audience, because, in an ideal Fiasco, we can both sympathize with the characters and hope to see them do well but also cringe in anticipation at how poorly this is all probably going to turn out. That dramatic juxtaposition makes for a lot of the fun in the genre.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465761/#Comment_465761" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-19T02:04:45+00:00" title="August 19, 2017  2:04AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 19, 2017 5:25AM by Jeff_Slater.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul_T<br/><br/>Ok, your answers are very good. You understand the characters and type of story, etc. very well on the whole. My impression was mistaken! You definitely seem to understand the game well; I think I was just reading you wrong. <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/><br/>Regarding how to interpret whether something is positive or negative for your character, Fiasco says the following:<br/><br/><i>"If you are Resolving, at any time during the scene you can take any die that remains in the central pile, white or black. If you take a white die, that is a signal that the outcome of the scene will be positive for your character. If you take a black die, it\u2019s the opposite \u2013 a negative outcome for your character.<br/>If you Established the scene, your friends will make this decision for you, reaching a decision about which die to give you however they like. <b>Whether you decide the outcome based on character- or player- level choices is up to you."</b></i>.<br/><br/>Jason leaves a lot of room to interpret things the way you want to as a group. Obviously, I use a house-rule when playing Fiasco so this might change the way the game plays. The reason I play with my house-rule is because it seemed like that "interpretation" would make the game work best and be most likely to naturally create a Coen-esque story. Plus it's part of a rule from <b>House of Spiders</b>, which has a rule that is inspired by this part of Fiasco. Although, the rule is quite different in a number of ways and creates more choices for interpreting narrative outcomes, and does so differently, which makes playing out the scene more relevant and interesting for my particular game and its aims. It's no Fiasco, but it's coming around, and maybe in a couple of years it will be "good." <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/> <br/><br/>P.S.<br/>I've played Fiasco about a dozen times and never had a bad game.  I know you're aware of this, but I just want to quantify the exact amount of times because I never did in the past.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465762/#Comment_465762" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-19T02:10:15+00:00" title="August 19, 2017  2:10AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I agree with all that.<br/><br/><i>Fiasco</i> quite intentionally leaves many of these things up to the group's judgement.

(Part of it might be a desire for their character to be a "fish out of water", and thrown into desperate circumstances beyond their control, which, when the player isn't able to articulate it to the others, can be difficult to deal with; but, aside from the Need, sometimes the Setup doesn't give clear direction either.)<br/><br/>For the sake of completeness, here are some of my other Fiasco experiences which I've written up:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20802/a-happy-fiasco" rel="nofollow">A Happy Fiasco</a> (my most successful game of Fiasco)<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/11702" rel="nofollow">Boomtown</a> (in retrospect, a very "polite" post - the game was very nearly a train wreck)<br/><br/>There are some interesting comments in those threads, too, and some insights into Jason's approach to designing and playing Fiasco.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM" title="Mongrel_GM"><img alt="Mongrel_GM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM">Mongrel_GM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465770/#Comment_465770" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-19T04:15:27+00:00" title="August 19, 2017  4:15AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeff, yes.

Here's the quote from the <b>FC</b>: <br/><br/><i>"You can't win, so don't try. <br/><br/>The dice\u2014and your friends\u2014have it in for your character. Approaching the game with the intention of overcoming every obstacle and watching your guy triumph is a recipe for a tenuous <b>Fiasco</b> session,  with equal parts crushing disappointment and boring, predictable play. Don't do it! <br/><br/>As we said before, your character is a hapless tool. Even if your guy is at the center of the clusterfuck and everything hinges on his goals and actions, he's just a piece of the overall story."</i><br/><br/>I think that the differences in our approaches and tastes account for why you typically prefer Simulationist RPGs with a GM, and I prefer  Narrativist, GMless Story Games.

I consider what is best for the story, but at the same time (as you have expressed) its important to consistently portray a character as driven by the character's personality, goals and desires. I definitely don't think this is an either/or proposition. I think it is necessary to do both in order to generate a good story and game. Mostly, I'm teasing Mongrel, because we know each other, have been discussing this for a long time, and have different tastes. He advocates, and wants what is best, for his character and assumes the story will take care of itself, (because that is the most enjoyable way to play for him); whereas, I emphasize the larger story, which would also include consistently portraying my character as driven by their personality, goals and desires. As long as I play and portray my character in a way that represents their nature, I don't care what happens to them as long as it makes a good story that retains its verisimilitude. Because Mongrel doesn't want bad things to happen to his character\u2014like another character doing something bad to them\u2014I have teased him in the past about trying to "win." We kind of see things differently on this front, and have different philosophies. We have pretty much been debating the point since the first Story Game we played together, haha <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/>  It's  really nice to have someone who is as passionate about the subject as I am, to have a lively discussion with <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/>.

One silly example - but one which might be familiar to you, Jeff - is the movie American Pie. Whatever you might think of it as a film, one thing it does which is interesting is how each character's storyline is arguably told in a different genre, while retaining coherence with the others.<br/><br/>I don't remember the names of the characters, but one is clearly living in a raunchy teen sex comedy, another in a romantic comedy (complete with ridiculously happy ending), the third in a very realistic kind of coming of age story (with a bittersweet ending), and the fourth a rather fantastic/surreal story.<br/><br/>A Rotating GM setup can do this kind of thing really well, without even trying!<br/><br/>Aside from that, I've seen two or three general approaches taken:<br/><br/>1. Let's spend time brainstorming and combining ideas until a coherent picture emerges, and make sure each player gets input into everything on the table. We count on the sensitivity of the players to do this well, but also (ideally) give them tools to do so. (Many of my games try to do this.)<br/><br/>2. Each player's input is distinct, a personal expression, and we trust that the whole will create something new and fun. (Games like Microscope.) the individuality of the inputs is part of the fun here.<br/><br/>3. One player (or the game itself) brings the vibe and style to the table and tries to make it so vivid that it's immediately obvious to the others which genre and style we are playing in; it's the job of the other players to try to match that as best they can.<br/><br/>Evocative imagery and strong themes are important here.
