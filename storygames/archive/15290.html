Norwegians communicate compared to us Finns. The Brits I've met must have been outliers, as Brits are often considered stuffy and formal, but to me they've seemed quite normal as well, with a fine sense of humor and humble kindness - not at all like they're depicted in costume dramas. Americans, in comparison, quite often come off as formal, self-important and high-strung; they're self-conscious about who they are and take easy offense at mere differences in opinion, and they're enmeshed in ideological systems that need to be accounted for. Central-Europeans are often what I'd consider reserved yet civilized, Francophones particularly, while Germans are pretty similar to Nordics, just a bit more formal.<br/><br/>Of course, the above impressions are purely anecdotal, in case somebody thought I'd been making a study out of it. Still, I'm left wondering about how quickly or slowly this received wisdom changes in comparison to reality; it seems that many well-known national stereotypes are from the 19th century, and people do change from generation to generation. Brits, for example - my experiences have left me thinking that maybe the folks who grew up through the Thatcher era and punk movement and Monty Pythonesque deconstructions of their culture and whatnot have largely shed an idiom of reservedness earned by their forebears? Or maybe modern Americans have developed during urbanization out of their reputed rough-and-ready identity and into something more akin to Victorian Brits?<br/><br/>For what it's worth, my most common encounter with cross-cultural communication issues is when somebody (often Anglo of some flavour, considering the demographics of the Internet) interprets me as offensive and overbearing when I merely intended to be analytically exact and neutral in tone. Seems that I'm personally prone to being offensive in this way, but it's also true that Finns interpret my writing/speaking style less often as if I were looking for a fight, rather assuming that I merely want a spirited debate. So it well might be the case that Nordics are rude, as Matthijs suspects up above, or at least that we're more thick-skinned so that rude people get more of a pass.<br/><br/>It's probably no surprise that I find other Nordics writing here at Story Games to be mostly pleasant and polite, even when I disagree with them strenuously about matters of substance. They don't do the passive-aggressive shit Americans are known for, nor the snide irony thing, and they engage conversations seriously instead of trolling for reactions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347353/#Comment_347353" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-31T05:35:22+00:00" title="October 31, 2011  5:35AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 31, 2011 5:38AM by GB_Steve.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brits are usually more reserved than Americans who have a level of honesty and quite frankly disclosure that's far from what we'd expect, especially on a first meeting.

For example, in my experience Americans are mainly called aggressive by people who are more passive, and passive by people who are more aggressive. <br/><br/>Tangent: I often try to understand someone else's perspective, even if I have a different perspective. For a lot of people, that helps cool down tensions and leads to mutual understanding. For others, it pisses them off! I'm constantly surprised every time someone gets upset when I respect their opinion, even if I don't completely agree with it. For some, being anything other than 100% aggressive is somehow being dishonest. But I don't know if I'm right (and often it's hard to be 100% right) till I understand the situation, so being aggressive without knowing the facts seems bizarre to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347358/#Comment_347358" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-31T06:08:49+00:00" title="October 31, 2011  6:08AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>It's probably no surprise that I find other Nordics writing here at Story Games to be mostly pleasant and polite, even when I disagree with them strenuously about matters of substance.

I've been living in Minnesota for the last seven years -- I've lived in several regions of the US.  This north-central part is heavily colonized by Nordics.  There's a Swedish institute in Minneapolis and the Norwegian royals were touring here a week or two ago, etc., etc.  It's also the part of the US with the strongest passive-aggressive tendency.  The phrase <i>Minnesota Nice</i> is a pleasant euphemism for this local cultural phenomenon (though it's present in northern Wisconsin and the Dakotas, at least) as well.  I'd assumed that like lefse and the Lutheran church, it was brought by the Scandinavians.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347368/#Comment_347368" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-31T08:34:47+00:00" title="October 31, 2011  8:34AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno Christopher, there's "southern nice" as well.

We're kind of like WASPs but without the fancy pedigree or money.<br/>Two of my great-grandfathers were abusive alcoholics who terrorized their immediate families. Each of my grandmothers dealt with this in a very distinctive way - my  German-Irish maternal grandmother became extremely emotionally (but, importantly, not physically) abusive of her own husband and children, while my Welsh paternal grandmother (who married my Swiss-German grandfather) did pretty much the opposite: she's a consummate, almost pathological people-pleaser who cries if you contradict her on anything with some emotional weight behind it.<br/><br/>Dunno if that correlates to people's experiences at all. Certainly there are many, many other factors in play here, but the more-British-ish side of my family is rowdy, direct, and a little crude, while the more-Germanic side of my family is quiet, affable, and inexpressive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347372/#Comment_347372" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-31T09:00:22+00:00" title="October 31, 2011  9:00AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To answer your questions:<br/><br/>You seem thoughtful and honest.<br/><br/>In my experience with a few Swedes, they are awesome!<br/><br/>Intentionally awesome? I don't know!<br/><br/>In my experience as Canadian, usually there's nothing to give away any particular Canadian or American 'ness'. However, there is usually more specific regionalism going on instead. IE folks from the Maritimes, or Kentucky or Nunavut, whatever. Us folks from Lotusland tend to be pegged as particularly quick to open up about who we are and what we're about. I think it's a very particular form of narcissism combined with a generally affable apathy; something to do with all the pot, multi  and mixed ethnicities, and granola.  <br/><br/>The Americans I meet seem to think there's something very special about Canada. Like, somehow it's the America in the movies with cleaner streets or socialized medicine, and everyone is beautiful and friendly. I'm not really sure what they're talking about. My trips to the States have been like trips to an alter Canada, somehow very similar yet subtly different. Seattle in my experience was a virtual extension of Vancouver or Victoria. <br/><br/>As far as attitudes are concerned. Americans seem to say that we're nice and quaint somehow. Canadians will not hesitate to bash the States for any reason on any topic but will then quickly apologize (often more than once) and then state at length that they somehow meant the US Gov't or Bush policies or Corporations or something, that the American people are lovely and diverse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347373/#Comment_347373" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-31T09:09:52+00:00" title="October 31, 2011  9:09AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel like I have some leeway to poke fun at Norwegians &amp; Scandinavians &amp; Nordics in general, since I'm fully Norwegian by blood (though I was born &amp; bred in the U.S.) and I still have family I'm in contact with in Norway who never did the immigration thing.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>they're enmeshed in ideological systems that need to be accounted for.</blockquote>\nI don't feel that Norwegians (and scandinavians &amp; nordics) are abrupt and rude, but in many cases they have this kind of hilarious attitude where they think they've overcome all these problems that U.S. citizens have--racial tension, being "enmeshed in ideological systems", etc. Oh, you rascally Norse!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347387/#Comment_347387" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-31T11:58:33+00:00" title="October 31, 2011 11:58AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>I seem to remember that some British people found the Archipelago phrase "Do it differently, please" to be too direct.</blockquote>\nHeh.

When I was a kid growing up in Canada, I always found Canadians to be really reserved and uptight while Americans were always really outgoing and friendly. This was most noticeable when flying.  You got on a plane with Canadians and nobody looked you in the eye, nobody talked.  You got on the plane with Americans and there was always lots of friendly joking and conversation.<br/><br/>Slowly, starting sometime in the mid-90s and really hitting a peak and plateau-ing after 9/11 (though this was a punctuation, for obvious reasons, but definitely not the cause), that reversed.  Now it's the Canadians who are joking and friendly and the Americans who are distant and unfriendly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347402/#Comment_347402" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-31T13:59:44+00:00" title="October 31, 2011  1:59PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Post in this thread to change my name to Norway N.

This is a change of pace eg. here in Finland - my parents' generation largely learned to think of themselves as a fringe culture where everything is more drab and backwards than the big and excellent things real civilized people down in Europe or over in America get. There's a lot of this syndrome still in Finnish public discourse, in fact; people will harp about how various choices will drive the country towards some sort of real becoming, as if we didn't have a perfectly admirable little society going. Things like having to get a Guggenheim museum to feel like a real boy (or a real European city, as the case may be) - ultimately shallow thinking, but the current middle-agers still seem to need this sort of thing. I imagine that in a decade or two we will fully join the Swedes and the Swiss and other such people in the permanently self-satisfied club, once the public discourse comes to be more dominated by my generation.<br/><br/>(Sweden and Denmark, in comparison, are old countries with quite a bit of pedigree - I don't really know, but I imagine that they're much more comfortable about thinking of themselves as belonging to the narrow top of the global pyramid. Finland as a whole was still in many ways what would be termed a third-world country a century ago, so the change has been rapid.)<br/><br/>Anyway, my point is that our younger, more international generation is sort of less humble in many ways. Of course there's pressure to conform to American models of narrative in many things, but often those don't fit because they're simply so alien. The two-party system, American racial tensions, the violence-based culture, survivalism myths, pro-life lobby, anti-gay politics, Bible as a credible societal guide, often enough the entire Republican party are just so out there that it's difficult to feel any responsibility for accomodating and applying them to our own lives here. This may easily come off as conceited, especially if you're yourself used to thinking of these things as universal facts, or perhaps facts that the rest of the world has to appreciate and accept due to how American owns the Internet etc. So I will totally own to this experience, I catch myself thinking close enough to what Hans describes now and then.<br/><br/>I'm also personally somewhat prickly about American cultural hegemony, so sorry about that. It comes with the hobby in a way, as roleplaying tends to get a lot of people who've been overexposed to American cultural influences, and this starts to grow old over time for anybody interested in world culture and nuanced thinking in general. My elder brother, for example, has all but lost any real connection to life as we know it out in the real world, preferring to frame his thinking and life experiences according to what his American gurus tell him. As one might imagine, this doesn't make me personally too disposed to leaning back and just allowing everything to be framed in an American way by default - I get enough of that with my brother, and with the other Finnish gamers and various other geeks who think that Finland has a bicameral parliament.<br/><br/>Still, to clarify, when we strip away the mirth and narratives about what we would like to be true, the bare bones of the matter is that people have different problems in different parts of the world, as the conditions are different. Nordic people often find it easy to take American social issues lightly simply because those problems don't apply to us. To my understanding this isn't because we're somehow smarter, but rather because we've never had to deal with the problems that come with building your country on stolen land and forced labor; that sort of thing has repercussions over long time-spans, and it will impact the national character. The truth is, we haven't overcome these problems - we simply haven't had to face them in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347457/#Comment_347457" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-31T19:03:48+00:00" title="October 31, 2011  7:03PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite><br/>I can't really tell if this is because they have actually come to grips with themselves in some fully-explored, existential way, or if they just kind of assume they have and act accordingly, but it's generally quite refreshing.</blockquote>\nI think it's just because it's cold there most of the time and they don't get a lot of sunlight.

I would post this under the assumption that we agree that Jews have been stigmatized forever, and that we both agree this is a bad thing. It would be intended as a wry joke about the fuckedupness of society, something like that.<br/><br/>However, experience has taught me that not everyone has the same type of humour when it comes to these things.

The influx of the Muslim diaspora and cheap manual labour from Eastern Europe have created big-time social and economic issues that they have never had to deal with before.  I travelled with a couple of really cool Danes, super liberal people, who were really struggling with the existence of a ghetto of Pakistani immigrants in Copenhagen, about how they seem to rely on their welfare state and are aggressive towards non-Muslims.  I also travelled with a very bitter Norwegian plumber who was much less circumspect about the cheap Polish labour undercutting his industry and pretty close to racist when he talked about the Muslim immigrants.  So it's good you Scandinavian gamers are starting to think about these things, because I suspect they will be in your face more and more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troels%20Ken" title="Troels Ken"><img alt="Troels Ken" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troels%20Ken">Troels Ken</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347502/#Comment_347502" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-01T06:47:25+00:00" title="November  1, 2011  6:47AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't recognise this picture of Scandinavia as free from racial and ethnic issues.

Not even Americans decorate their Christmas trees with flags. Norwegian breath smells like reindeer meat, except after breakfast, when it\u2019s pickled herring.  They eat hotdogs constantly, with salmon paste from a tube as a condiment. They\u2019re drunk all winter, which is dangerous; since they drive the biggest SUVs in Europe.  Winter is hard, but Norwegians are soft; because of their penchant for heated toilet seats and towel racks.  And vacationing in Southeast Asia.  Although, that may have decreased since so many of them died in the 2004 tsunami.  Probably not, since they\u2019ve been sailing aquavit across the equator for generations to make it more potent, so they could forget how humiliating it is to have been ruled by the Swedes. Apparently they miss the Swedes, having built the Oslo airport to look identical to an Ikea from the outside, with chintzy-modern bench/fan/lamp combo-furniture on the inside. Norway still has a monarchy, so clearly they love being bossed around.  For example they all paint their houses the same color.  For a while it was red, then a couple years later, yellow.  I haven\u2019t checked.  Maybe now it\u2019s Coral.  I was going to say something about how Norwegians dress, but really it\u2019s no different from other Eurotrash.  Norwegians say \u2018bye-bye\u2019 like children, which is funny when you hear a cop say it.  But they also say \u2018hi hi\u2019, which is just stupid.  <br/><br/>If you\u2019re a story-gamer from another region\u2014 having trouble grasping Jeep or Nordic roleplaying-- its probably because

mind that, just because something is more common in some cultures, it doesn't apply to everyone (which is, of course, the difference between generalizations and stereotyping).<br/><br/>One of my favorite non-fiction books is a German book called <i>Bildung</i>. In it, Dietrich Schwanitz has a section on cultural values to help people understand different cultures. These are simply ways of communicating within a culture that are more common to a particular culture than another, but again, this doesn't apply to everyone. Every cultural value (or generalization) usually works as "many people x, several people y, a few people anti-x."<br/><br/>That all said, he thinks that in general, the British cultural way of communication is understatement, the Southern European way is theatricality (which he thinks is positive, full of joy and passionate expression), and the Nordic way is authenticity. I definitely find myself fitting in there. I have a strong desire to be "authentic," for whatever that means in the end, and I may have clashed with one or two Brits among you. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>This difference goes alongside the Catholic/Lutheran divide. Catholicism has a lot of "pomp and circumstance," with colorful attire of priests and involved rituals. Lutheranism, on the other hand, is all about the individual's direct and unadulterated relationship with faith and "don't give me any of that fancy ritual stuff, this iz serious bizniz." Not surprisingly, Southern Europe is largely Catholic, while the Nordic areas are Protestant. Whether the cultural values cause the adoption of certain religious ways or the other way around, who knows (probably a mix of both).<br/><br/>In the end, we're all individuals, and without getting to know us, there's no way of telling if we're one of the many, several, or few.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347747/#Comment_347747" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-03T09:41:44+00:00" title="November  3, 2011  9:41AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's fascinating, Christian.

Whereas the Americans hereabouts, when they say something controversial, do not <i>simply</i> do so.  They either go to great lengths to be pleasant and explain themselves, or they ram it down their audience's throat as forcefully as possible.  It's as if saying something unpopular means Americans expect people to hate them, so they either fight that or embrace it.  <br/><br/>Whereas you three don't expect to be hated, so you just say what you think, period.  I find that very refreshing.  <br/><br/>I'm also a bit jealous.  Americans on the internet <i>will</i> hate.  I don't think it takes too much effort to avoid it... but it doesn't take <i>zero</i> effort either.  (Or am I just talking about <i>people</i> on the internet?  I have no idea.)<br/><br/>Actually, I could replace every use of "Americans" above with "all native English speakers".

Some regions generally feature loud fast-talking, and seemingly rude people, and other regions have a slow drawl and a reserved politeness.  Some regions are somewhere in between.<br/><br/>I've observed similar types of diversity in smaller countries.  In the UK, for example, it seems to me that there are different types of folks who are influenced by their local sub-cultures and have different types of behavior.

Northerners have a reputation for being blunter, tougher, more taciturn, more friendly, tighter with money...the list goes on and on.<br/><br/>One very interesting way to look at it is that in the latter part of the first millennium, the northern half of the British Isles was run by Vikings, whereas the south remained under Saxon rule. This difference can still be seen in people's DNA, in their place names and local dialect words, and to a degree, in their social customs. No doubt you can stretch the idea too far, but given that a thousand years have elapsed since those times, it fascinates me that it holds true at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347899/#Comment_347899" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-04T17:11:00+00:00" title="November  4, 2011  5:11PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 4, 2011 5:11PM by akooser.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite><blockquote><br/>I'm also personally somewhat prickly about American cultural hegemony, so sorry about that.
