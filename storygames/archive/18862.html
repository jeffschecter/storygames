That said, they declare on their KickStarter to be "compatible" with FATE, Pathfinder, etc ...<br/>Here's two examples (but there are others) :<br/>- <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vorpalgames/red-aegis-roleplaying-game" rel="nofollow">Red Aegis</a><br/>- <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/modiphius/achtung-cthulhu-the-ww2-keepers-and-investigators" rel="nofollow">achtung cthulhu</a><br/><br/>Now, you might even notice that sometimes the "module that allows compatibility" with those systems are not even in the starting goal, but in the stretch.<br/><br/>Is claiming "compatibility" with FATE, Pathfinder, 13th age, dungeon world really worth the trouble? Does it bring in "natural customers"? Or is it too much work for it (I'm talking ROI here)? Where should it be on the stretch (far below or really among the first ones)? Or should it be included in the first goal? Should we do only one or all of them?<br/>You might also notice that those "rewards" are usually only provided in pdf as rewards.<br/>Also, I would guess it would possible to "advertise" on forums, addressing those communities.<br/><br/>Anyone has an idea on this? Some data? Experience to share? Advices to give me?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422308/#Comment_422308" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-02T10:38:13+00:00" title="October  2, 2013 10:38AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What this telegraphs to me is that you don't care about the rules you wrote <i>to accompany your own setting.</i> If any rules will do, why did you include any?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422309/#Comment_422309" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-02T10:51:09+00:00" title="October  2, 2013 10:51AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a counterpoint, there were Kickstarters that I had no interest in UNTIL they added compatibility with 13th Age.

I guess sometimes there might be first-mover advantages (first horror setting for Pathfinder, or something like that) or such, but that'd be rare. Other things being equal, something like FATE compatibility will only be useful insofar as there exists an audience of people who like both your setting, and play FATE exclusively (that is, so much that they'd care about having FATE in lieu of something else).<br/><br/>One thing we do know: this is very well-trod ground in the rpg publishing culture, and the idea that people want new fluff with the convenience of compatibility with their old system is not new; things like GURPS exist pretty much on this premise. There are people who definitely see value in one-system-\xfcber-alles in their personal hobby, and then there are people who are actively disinterested. Myself, for example - if you present your rpg product as "arbitrarily mechanized", so that it just happens to have rules set X bolted onto it, it'll be a big turn-off for me, simply because it's proof positive that your project is really just an exercise in creative writing and not rpg design. (If it was rpg design, you'd presumably have designed it for some specific game, instead of being willing to whore it out under whatever brand name happens to be hot at the moment.)<br/><br/>So yeah, different audience segments, different reactions. A small press publisher can't hope to hit all audiences at the same time, and no publisher at all may hope to make everybody happy at the same time in a highly specialized market like this, so it all depends on the particulars of the project.<br/><br/>One pretty clear-cut situation occurs to me: if you've got a popular IP that you're turning into a roleplaying game product, it might not be a bad idea to position the product as system-neutral, with conversion notes for half a dozen popular systems "in the back" or in the Internet or wherever. The reason why this might be smart is that with a pre-existing IP you're basically trolling for fans of the property, and your sales argument is going to be that your product is full of property-related content. Presumably these fan customers will buy it for the fluff and then adapt it to their game of choice, or they might even be completely uncaring of systemic issues - in either case you won't lose much if you alienate the system-afficinados in the audience by attempting to cover all bases.<br/><br/>One more thought: I suspect that whether compatibility branding brings customers depends heavily on the specific brand, simply because the different games appeal to different sorts of people on the average. A simple "compatible with X" claim might be very appealing to a fan of a game that in itself claims that system doesn't matter, or that their system does "everything", or similar obfuscatory claims about the roleplaying process. On the other hand, claiming compatibility with a game whose audience prizes very specific operative interactions of setting and system might seem like a ridiculous claim to that audience. Thus it makes more sense to claim compatibility with GURPS or d20 than with e.g. Sorcerer or old-school D&amp;D (unless of course your thing is, in fact, designed to work with the latter), simply because a fan of GURPS will have realistic expectations about what such "compatibility" means: they'll be expecting a book of fluff with mechanical interpretations of the narrative elements tacked on. That's something achievable for a generic setting product, unlike the highly specialized sort of interfacing that some other type of game might require.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422311/#Comment_422311" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-02T10:59:12+00:00" title="October  2, 2013 10:59AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It occurs to me that this would be an excellent market research topic for anybody considering a publication that has leeway in what system to use for it. Think up your research plan well, and you'll get both pre-marketing for the project (as you troll for answers to your poll, and present facts about your product alongside the questionnaire), and useful data to base your system choice on. For example, if you find out that 20% of your sample group play FATE and 100% of those would only buy your thing if it had FATE stats, while 60% play Pathfinder, but merely 10% of them would find Pathfinder compatibility mandatory... that's the sort of data that might well help you choose which system to present your thing for!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422312/#Comment_422312" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-02T11:02:42+00:00" title="October  2, 2013 11:02AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm generally of a mind with the above, that it's tough to do in a way which is convincing.

So I'm comfortable with both systems. I can port rules back and forth for specific purposes, or write up the same character, monster, or situation that I have in my head for both systems, and while they won't work exactly the same in both, they'll still be interesting in both and make sense in context (also, in my experience, it's entirely possible for two different old school D&amp;D games to be just as different from each other as each are from any particular Dungeon world game, so there's kinda that to deal with as well).<br/><br/>If I knew how to make decent 3.x/Pathfinder versions of my stuff, it would absolutely make good financial sense to do it. But I don't.<br/><br/>I'm also pretty leery of the Dungeon World rules ports that are becoming more popular lately. Basic Roleplaying, 3rd edition D&amp;D, Savage Worlds, and even Fate have been around for a while. Lots of people have lots of experience with them, and it's not all that hard to find (or be) someone with that level of familiarity. Look at Jason's firefighter thing for Fate: he knows how firefighting works, he explains it to some dudes who know how Fate works, game happens. Is the same thing going to happen with all these kickstarters and their various versions? Apocalypse World is pretty new and most people are coming to it because of Dungeon World, which is even newer. Is it even possible to have the same kind of expertise with Apocalypse world as the guys doing those firefighting rules have with Fate?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist" title="Antisinecurist"><img alt="Antisinecurist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist">Antisinecurist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422332/#Comment_422332" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-02T14:54:56+00:00" title="October  2, 2013  2:54PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I can understand Achtung Cthulhu using FATE and Savage Worlds.

And thanks for your time.<br/>Okay, if I understand you well : being "multi systems" is an asset if your product type is "fit" for it (sorry for the phrasing here).<br/><br/>My project is about a campaign, Avalanche, and a website that supports its unique structure (and thus offer functions for it) : it is a multi plots, calendar based campaign, using the structure of a storyboard. So, it is purely about the design of fluff and there is no mechanic related to it. In fact, it looks like an "illustrated heroic fantasy novel" or an "odd comic book". It is basically your typical fantasy setting with a new way to present the plots/stories that are non linear (the innovation is there).<br/>And please note that I have playtested in length Avalanche with dnd, the shadow of yesterday, burning wheel. It works well with all of them, but better with a strong narrative system (They really help each other out). <br/>So, following your advices, I guess I'm eligible !!!<br/><br/><i>Disclaimer</i> : I'm not caring if this makes a product better. I'm talking about raising money and increasing my chance of success for my KickStarter campaign.<br/>I'll go with three categories of questions, and then some remarks.<br/><br/>Systems :<br/>- As I see it, to make my campaign "compatible" is basically providing characters sheets (around a hundred). You would not believe how Avalanche is typical ...<br/>- What I read here is that FATE and Pathfinder are easy and sure picks.<br/>- AW? I'm not sure from what I read here ... I guess I want to stay away from this.<br/>- I could even have something around TSOY. BW ... I would have to ask Luke I guess.<br/>- how about 13th world?<br/>- others you see?<br/><br/>About the stretch :<br/>- <a href="/forums/profile/Adam">@Adam</a> : what I read is that the stretch must be reach before you pledge in ...<br/>- Are those systems so important that they should be right after the initial goal? Or integrated into the initial goal? Do you feel, as a backer there is some kind of "trigger" about this (I'll take a look until it reaches that specific stretch)?<br/>- What I'm talking about here is "Return On Investment". Right now, we're estimating the integration of a system at a value of 4K. So, I need to be "sure" somehow, that the system will bring me more than that.<br/>- I think that reaching one stretch, I want to just "give away" the "compatibility" (i.e. available for everyone), no? Or, is there value to have some kind of printed/original/special reward around it?<br/>- One question, and has it been done/even doable : could I "call" for designers who have a system, ask how much they would ask for "translation" into their system and add this into my campaign? The idea is provide some money to the creator and a new product to use (like <a href="/forums/profile/Graham">@Graham</a> described). Is it even worth a try?<br/><br/>What should I be doing next :<br/>- Should I begin being present on those various communities to see which ones seem the most responsive?<br/>- I'm working on a new "teaser" for Avalanche, I guess I should rush it ...<br/>- Any other things I should do?<br/><br/>Some comments :<br/><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> : thanks. There is a lot of your responses in the above. In by the way, you might not remember it, but you do have a copy of Avalanche. As for the market research : the hell I would need it!!<br/><a href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">@James_Stuart</a> : that's why I guess you want systems that have some "generic" purposes by themselves ...<br/><a href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">@J_Walton</a> : I'll stay away from "phony" system. And the question : is it worth it? I won't please everyone ... but do I please more people?<br/><a href="/forums/profile/Graham">@Graham</a> : Exactly. And what I come to realize, is that, if your project "allows it", it can be used as an asset.<br/><a href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">@Johnstone</a> : Yes, it is about finance ... not design.<br/><br/>Thanks again to everyone !!!<br/><br/><i>[why I propose a system] You may skip this if you don't care.<br/>Originally, this project was about Avalanche and the website : I had no intention of releasing a system. The project went "on hold" and I came to design games for mobile phone, website and Facebook. Doing this, I worked with a game designer [who became my friend], who did a lot of rpg and was looking to design his own pen and paper rpg. So, we worked together on this, on our spare time, coming up with a somehow "generic system" that is, in our opinion, elegant and simple. Those are the two key words. Want to take a look for yourself? Is this <a href="http://www.existanc3.com/Shadow_and_light" rel="nofollow">there</a>.<br/>[edit]Not having a system was somehow a problem, because people told me I didn't have a game.

I certainly remember the project, and agree that it is a very good candidate for multiple-systems treatment. I have my misgivings about it (mainly about how a lack of dedicated system makes the game fundamentally incomplete, no matter how high the quality of the campaign material), but I do agree that a proactive GM willing to do a bit of legwork should find the Avalanche material very useful for FATE, TSoY, Burning Wheel, and other similarly story-oriented games that can deal with a highly ambitious fantasy adventure campaign with a strong metaplot. Dungeon World would also make sense, I believe - Avalanche has certain systemic features that mesh well with AW-style GM prep responsibilities.<br/><br/>(For those who are not familiar with it: Avalance is this unique and crazily ambitious high fantasy setting/campaign that Pells has been working on for a decade already. Imagine the scope and ambition of the Dragonlance campaign, except no rules-system, no plot railroad, and the material has all been arranged into a reference system consisting of time-lines, dramatis personae and geographical atlases, so as to make it feasible for the GM to handle the high density of information. The big Achilles's heel of the project is that Avalanche doesn't have a truly natural game system to exist in, so the threshold of commitment is pretty steep for anybody who considers playing it - you're either stuck with D&amp;D-by-default, or will have to do some major hacking on your favourite fantasy adventure system. Very unique due to the novel timeline-oriented campaign arc, well worth the time for anybody interested in high fantasy adventure rpgs.)<br/><br/>Assuming that Avalanche hasn't changed much since we've last discussed it, I still think that your best bet for making it "accessible" is to get in touch with suitable designers who can help you develop system backing for your creative writing; I think it's a mistake to think of this as merely a superficial matter of "converting numbers" from one system to another - it's ultimately a highly unique question as to how each individual game (especially modern games!) should treat something like Avalanche. Multi-system may well be the way to go; as we've discussed, it's the sort of project for which it makes perfect sense to put the material onto a website, which in turn makes it trivial to provide mechanical notes for several systems without compromising usability. Also, crowdfunding seems like a fine addition to your plans: you could arrange in advance for designer X to work out the Avalanche treatment in system Y, and then put it up to the people to determine whether that's something they want to pay for. (Could be multiple separate crowdfunding campaigns, note: first you fund the initial system-free release in whatever manner, then run rounds of funding in cooperation with well-known designers to have the material fitted for whatever systems seem likely to attract funding.)<br/><br/>On the other hand, all that's going to absolutely suck if you don't believe in system development yourself. If I had to choose between getting the material in the way you believe in it, or getting something developed just because everybody else wants to have rules, then I'll go for the first option. Ultimately I believe that Avalanche already has about 60% of an implicit system contained in it (it's impossible to do elaborate campaign prep without implying much about the type of game the prep is for), so the ideal choice would be to bring out that system, but this is such a specialized case of rpg-related creativity that I'm very much keen to see what <i>your</i> ideal publication looks like, and to hell with what anybody else thinks.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422341/#Comment_422341" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-02T19:27:53+00:00" title="October  2, 2013  7:27PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for the simple question: assuming that you decide to attempt to launch with multiple rules-systems, which systems should those be? I recommend the following, off the top of my hat:<br/><br/><b>Pathfinder:</b> Your original literary inspiration is D&amp;D, so this adaptation is ultimately very simple and natural. So much so that I could see Avalanche as a Pathfinder-only campaign, if you only were more excited about 3rd edition D&amp;D yourself. The big thing here is that ambitious campaign products are Paizo's flagship strength, so you're setting yourself up for a comparison - could mean that you've got an already-established audience that wants a campaign product, or could mean that Paizo fans don't want it because it's not structured and written exactly like a Paizo campaign path.<br/><br/><b>Dungeon World:</b> If you can find a competent designer to do the adaptation, I think this would be a very natural fit. Trickier than Pathfinder, but not too much so, because the game totally fits that same mold of adventuring parties and missions and whatnot. A solid choice if you feel the need to attract audiences for which Pathfinder is hopelessly old-fashioned bullshit. DW doesn't have traditional big-setting stuff for it yet, so I could see many DW-enthusiasts checking out your thing if you could convince them that it's not a hack job.<br/><br/><b>Swords &amp; Wizardry:</b> I hate myself creatively for this suggestion, but it has to be said that Frog God Games has been doing some pretty good business on trad D&amp;D stuff disguised as old school (if that didn't make sense, pay no mind - it's about different types of D&amp;D). This tells me that while I'm personally not too fond of a plot-and-character-based middle-school D&amp;D product myself, there seem to be plenty of people who play old school retroclones like S&amp;W, yet desire more modern campaign material. It's a somewhat tricky market, as it seems sometimes that nostalgia and superficial name-dropping are the main determinants of success, but it could potentially be an easy addition to your line-up. The big advantage is that adaptation for old school D&amp;D is very, very easy mechanically, much easier than any other options; it does nothing to make the material truly suited for old school play, but as I indicated, it seems to me that there is an audience for all sorts of things out there.<br/><br/>(An idea, off-hand: if you decide to do Pathfinder and S&amp;W both, then it'll make plenty of sense to actually get in touch with the FGG guys and see if they'd like to work on the conversions with you, and perhaps partner up for the crowdfunding. I'm suggesting this because they've run some pretty successful crowdfunding campaigns over the last couple of years, so there's a lot of relevant expertise there for what you're thinking of doing.)<br/><br/>FATE, TSoY and Burning Wheel are all creatively exciting options as well, but they'd also require more adaptation - old-fashioned game-design basically, somebody would need to figure out exactly what it is that this game can do with material like Avalanche. I would not consider these to be priorities for Avalanche in the first phase, simply because there are more pressing issues like basic publishing model and Pathfinder adaptation (really, it's likely to be the single most important system for you both commercially and creatively) to consider. I could see you doing FATE or TSoY after you've already gotten to the market and figured out how you're dealing with the D&amp;D / Pathfinder opportunities.<br/><br/>If your goal is to simply scrape for customers without any particular artistic agenda, I would suggest saving yourself the effort of attempting the highly technical design challenge of adapting for the above modern drama-oriented games. Rather, if you just want to have many systems for obscure market positioning reasons, start with Pathfinder, then Savage Worlds, and then whatever trad-style point-buys have been openly licensed lately - the D6 system would be a good candidate along the lines I'm thinking here. As long as you limit yourself to what I like to call "traditional" games, meaning ones without anything particular going in the campaign-structuring department, it's relatively simple to just stat up Avalanche for that game and be done with it.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422351/#Comment_422351" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-02T21:12:25+00:00" title="October  2, 2013  9:12PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Ah, yes - we're talking about Avalanche!

The major DW-related kickstarters are Inverse World, which  had 763 backers (and have accepted orders past the end of the kickstarter date), and Grim World, which had 666. Both those books come with new character classes, though, and those are more popular than adventures.

By default, d20 is far less evocative than *World. There's enough in *World that if people grok <i>some</i> of it but not all of it, the result is still generally an enjoyable game. It's easy to lose perspective and get irked at *World hacks for not pushing the system to the max, so that you lose sight of the fact that many of the hacks are still excellent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422571/#Comment_422571" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-07T17:52:15+00:00" title="October  7, 2013  5:52PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nah, the engine of *World can be made to do really boring bad things, like d20.

But I also agree that it's more evocative than d20 or GURPs. Some mechanics simply do more fictional work than others. The move structure is inherently fictional; if it's done badly the game feels messy and listless, and you can't really get at all of the actions you want to be able to perform and end up feeling like you're shoehorning things into moves they aren't "supposed" to be covered by. But the system does a lot more of the work for you. This doesn't make it "better." Just so, plenty of people hate the FATE's aspect system and the FATE economy. That doesn't change that those mechanics tighten up the linkages between what's happening at the table and what's happening in the fiction.\n<blockquote><br/>But these systems do different things ultimately, so that has an impact on what type of evocation they do.

I certainly agree that all of these systems can be equally <i>interesting</i> and <i>fun</i>. I'm not sold on "evocative" but that's sort of a loaded word that everyone loads differently. What you see to be describing is D&amp;D's greater mechanical specificity and ... let's call it mechanical vocabulary. It has more bits and bobs it can use to make differences between creatures and classes and whatnot numerically explicit. That's great that the system can be so descriptive, but there's a subtlety between evoking and describing that speaks to how the games work rather than just to petty pedantry.<br/><br/>Sometimes fictional work is embedded almost directly into the dice themselves as with Trollbabe's number and Ghost/Echo's danger/goal system. Ghost/Echo isn't necessarily a better, more interesting game than D&amp;D. But the dice themselves force you to prioritize and make choices with consequences and force yourself into difficult situations in order to succeed. The die mechanics evoke a style of play--in particular one of risk and desperation. Of course in a group that isn't into that, it can fall horribly flat as people add uninteresting or nonthreatening dangers just to boost their chance to succeed--again, it's not better. But much as I enjoy playing them, I don't see Scion and D&amp;D creating that kind of low-level tension and fiction. The fiction and evocation happens at a higher level which can be just as fun, interesting, and "good." But it's like the difference between Candide and Don Quixote or Mistborn and Lord of the Rings--one of them leaps right off the page and the other meanders, more enjoyable to remember what you just read than it is to read line-by-line.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422712/#Comment_422712" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-10T15:04:14+00:00" title="October 10, 2013  3:04PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            GURPS is just as fiction-oriented as AW, it's just that GURPS mechanics activate at a different point in the fictional process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422717/#Comment_422717" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-10T16:38:41+00:00" title="October 10, 2013  4:38PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>GURPS is just as fiction-oriented as AW, it's just that GURPS mechanics activate at a different point in the fictional process.</blockquote>\nI think in terms of knowing when to roll that's true, but it's a false statement in terms of what's waiting on the other end of the roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422719/#Comment_422719" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-10T18:13:42+00:00" title="October 10, 2013  6:13PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nah, at the other end of the roll, the GM tells you what happens.

I intend to commission people who are renowned for the given system, who would say Avalanche is compatible and who would know what is needed.<br/>- To that "commission fee", I'll add KS fee, management and design/layout, support and distribution. This is going to be the stretch. Done by the project, under my supervision, by the experts of the systems. I think this is solid.<br/>- Now, where do I put this in my stretch? In fact, my backers will tell me.<br/>- We're going to add on all reward level (starting at 1$), a vote to decide of the next stretch.<br/>- What we want is to "upsale" our customers : "you want a 13th age compatibility? Then back at 1$, vote for it". Once the stretch is bought, I guess those customers will "move" to a higher reward level.<br/>- We also hope those we "commission" will have an interest in having that stretch goal reached ... thus talking about it to his/her community.<br/>- I should have next week a 85 pages pdf extract of Avalanche, so the "compatibility" should be easier to understand for it ...<br/><br/>What do you think?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422846/#Comment_422846" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-14T16:10:06+00:00" title="October 14, 2013  4:10PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>JD, you are full of crap and I will write a blog post to tell you why, so there <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\n+1!<br/><br/>Please link us when you do, and would love to see rebuttal as well (if any)!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
