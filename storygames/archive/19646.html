I'm working on a game, simplest summary would be Grand Theft Auto RPG: an Apocalypse World hack set in a modern-era city, themed around crime, violence, and greed. I've had my first playtesting session with some success, but I've already encountered a problem I didn't expect: player motivation/alignment. I imagined that giving players crime-themed characters with powerful abilities and a big city to mess up would result in, well, a similar situation to Grand Theft Auto where things like "collateral damage" or "number of police officers killed" would be fun bonuses rather than tragic consequences. How many times have we seen a group of D&amp;D murderhobos gleefully slaughter the town watch, right? I didn't think that players needed a impetus to break the rules. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, so far my players have been quite timid. Though I've deliberately steered the game away from the "vigilante" angle - I wanted to make that a separate game - they keep seeing themselves as fighting for justice and trying to avoid violence or breaking the law, when I as the GM am saying, "No, it's fine, your character is a hardened murderer, right? Just shoot the cop in the face. Stop worrying so much." I have some angles planned for the game economy, but I don't think that imaginary wealth is going to be enough of a "carrot" as I thought. Another idea I've had is adding a character alignment system, but how do I prevent every person in the group from picking "Neutral Good" or the equivalent?<br/><br/>This is something I'm interested beyond my crime RPG. I have plans for evil D&amp;D campaigns as well. Of course, it's possible that this simply isn't the right group for such a game, and they're not interested in a game where they can't be heroic and selfless. But I'm still interested in your feedback on <b>what I can do to make my players less afraid of the consequences of their actions</b>. It's funny how this is the opposite situation many GMs find themselves in, where instead of following their nice prepared storyline, the players are just fucking around killing guards and robbing people. I'm actually looking for ways to motivate my players to act out, fuck stuff up, take what they want and don't let anybody stop you.<br/><br/><b>TLDR: How can I get my players to cut loose and enjoy their inner demons instead of being goody two-shoes?</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/arscott" title="arscott"><img alt="arscott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/arscott">arscott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436352/#Comment_436352" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-04T04:34:49+00:00" title="August  4, 2014  4:34AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It sounds like your asking your players to be a sort of cartoonishly evil that rarely exists in real life.

Heat:</b> Instead of marking experience when they roll with certain stats, they mark experience when they take heat, which can be gained as the price of a move or as the result of missing a move. Heat reflects the attention they're drawing from the authorities and from other criminals who are getting tired of them pissing on their patch: if it reaches 5, the character is out of the game, but there are moves to reduce it. The upshot is that the fastest way to advance in the game is to break the law and not worry about the immediate consequences, as long as you take care of things before it's too late.<br/><br/><b>2. Income:</b> Each playbook has an entry for how they make a living, based on what their particular criminal speciality is, so the  drug-dealer type has to keep a minimum number of residents supplied with drugs and the getaway driver needs to have a fully functioning vehicle ready to go. If their means of supporting themselves is threatened, they end up going short, which means they can't depend on having the ready cash to buy anything, pay debts, etc. If they are short, they mark experience for restoring their livelihood, so again this encourages them to play in a way that pursues the character's criminal activities.<br/><br/><b>TLDR: If you want a certain type of play, use rules that support, encourage or reward the players when they engage in that type of play.</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436358/#Comment_436358" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-04T06:57:26+00:00" title="August  4, 2014  6:57AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's also possible that they're not that type of player, just as there's D&amp;D groups out there who refuse to embrace heroism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436370/#Comment_436370" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-04T11:04:39+00:00" title="August  4, 2014 11:04AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would not want to participate in such a game.

I do agree that forcing/goading people into actions they don't actually want to do is not generally fun. I guess I figured that, with the popularity of games like GTA/Payday and crime or heist movies, it wouldn't be an issue. But it's true that not everybody is into being the bad guy in that scene, just like not everybody is into being the selfless hero in swords &amp; sorcery. It's probably that my group is more interested in helping me playtest my RPG than in actually roleplaying as criminals. It's a group I'm relatively new to, but I can say that when we played D&amp;D it was hard to get them to do anything other than the immediately obvious "right thing to do": my Rogue was hard-pressed to find a way to be a stinker without ruining the campaign.<br/><br/>I did have "player goals" in mind - initially I planned to use Dungeon World's alignment system, where if you fulfill your alignment during a session (in this case, progress towards your goal) you gain experience. This along with a Wealth system will be in the final game, but I suspect it's not enough for this particular group of players.<br/><br/>Mr. Mullen, I have looked at The Hood playbooks previously, and you've done some great stuff. While I like the idea of having a "Heat" score on your character sheet (I will probably rename it Wanted or something since I'm still using "Hot" as a stat), it seems pretty harsh that 5 points in Heat is an automatic game over for that PC. How has that worked out for you in practice?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436386/#Comment_436386" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-04T12:41:39+00:00" title="August  4, 2014 12:41PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heat at 5 has worked fine so far: there's plenty of time to lose heat here &amp; there and if you're really up against the wall, you can always shift the blame to another PC instead of taking the heat yourself, but they get the experience as well.<br/><br/>If 'burned at heat 5' seems too harsh, then it's easy to give PCs a buffer zone: when they're at 5, allow them to still act, as long as their moves are directed towards losing at least 1 heat as soon as possible, the same way the Feelgood's 'healing' move allows a character who is out to stay in the game as long as they get to the Feelgood in a timely fashion and don't get sidetracked by something else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/arscott" title="arscott"><img alt="arscott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/arscott">arscott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436388/#Comment_436388" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-04T12:57:18+00:00" title="August  4, 2014 12:57PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hold on though.

That saturation of over-the-top mayhem doesn't work in RPGs as well as it does in video games.  It has to do with expectations of narrative.  It's the same reason that my character will walk into someone's house and smash pots in Zelda, but would never dream of doing the thing in D&amp;D, even though they're both games about going into dungeons to fight monsters, find cool treasure, and save the world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436389/#Comment_436389" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-04T13:04:16+00:00" title="August  4, 2014  1:04PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 4, 2014 1:05PM by CarpeGuitarrem.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is definitely something worth discussing beforehand, too.

You can't (and shouldn't) ever "force" your players to do something they don't want to do. At the very worst, you can say, "Hey, I have a game in which the characters will act like this, and only like this. Do you still want to play it?" Make it explicit.<br/><br/>2. Proper game design, as pointed out above, can work to create certain effects in the fiction. If you really want to have an "alignment" system (and I don't know if that's really the best thing for a GTA-type game), why not make a list of alignments like Greedy, Violent, Compulsive Liar, Compulsive Arsonist, and Serial Killer? That makes the direction of your game very clear, not unlike my point <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, above.<br/><br/>3. Violence and crime, on its own, isn't very interesting or engaging. It sounds like you're giving your players more interesting things to interact with, which is an interesting thing. Violence and crime, on its own, is (almost) never a motivation in itself, unless you've got a cardboard 2-dimensional cartoon villain (and even that guy isn't interesting unless he has a hero to oppose or something good to fight against). Focus, instead, on interesting and desirable things, and then set up your game so that the only way (or the easiest way, or the most incentivized way) to get them is to commit crime.<br/><br/>It could be as simple as asking your players things like:<br/><br/>"What does your character want more than anything in the world?"<br/>"What's stopping them from getting it?"<br/>"If they had no moral compunctions/if nobody was watching, how could they break the law to get what they want?"<br/>"What would it take for you to [do awful things]?"<br/><br/>Focus on the motivation and the rewards. The best villains all want something we can understand (like to save their little girl from harm, or revenge, or a desire to be accepted); it's the means they use to try to achieve that thing which we do not accept.<br/><br/>But, no matter what, get the players on board! This shouldn't be a guessing game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436537/#Comment_436537" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-06T04:56:23+00:00" title="August  6, 2014  4:56AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 6, 2014 5:10AM by Rickard.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In <b>Dogs in the Vineyard</b> you end up as bastards, even if you try to do good.
