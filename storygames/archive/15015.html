Imagine a decaying future Earth, struggling to rise from the ashes of a war that nearly shattered it. Androids have been the instrument of our undoing, and people flee from Earth in order to find better life in the offworld colonies. But some androids still hide amongst us. They cover their true identity, even to themselves, under a layer of false memories, trying to escape from the hunt, to the paradises man is struggling to create beyond the Earth sky. Androids on Earth are hunted upon identification. And what if you were one of them?<br/><br/>During the game all players create characters whose main characteristic is a memory, which is described as if it were a photo. During the game's flow, this memory will be enriched with details called solaces, or clouded by contradictions and doubts, called scars. In the end, the game takes to a revelation where a character's scars and solaces will tell us whether he is a human or an android.<br/><br/>The game is based upon the fiction narrated in Philip K. Dick's <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i> and Ridley Scott's masterpiece <i>Blade Runner</i> and aims to create intense narration as players will be facing a dilemma: will I try to protect the authenticity of my memory and be human, or will I pursue my personal goal, no matter the price?<br/><br/>I am currently finishing it, and soon it will be available for purchase in book and PDF format, somewhere in the first half of 2012.<br/>Right now I have to figure where and how to print it, considering that I live in Italy, but the game is meant to be published and distributed in America.<br/><br/>I have been lucky, I'll be honest. I'm very satisfied with the result but this would not have been possible without the great people who showed interest in this project and helped me with their playtesting and advice, and I would use this chance to thank Davide, Raffaele, Ben, Vincent, Joshua, Robert, Emily, Sebastian, Jason, Tim, Joe, Paul and all the people who kindly playtested the game or gave me their advice. <br/><br/>I'll be posting an actual play of one of the recent playtest next.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Davide%20Losito" title="Davide Losito"><img alt="Davide Losito" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.webinprogress.it/allyraid/badtoro2out.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Davide%20Losito">Davide Losito</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341282/#Comment_341282" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-01T16:17:14+00:00" title="September  1, 2011  4:17PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have been following this game since the first idea on how to use dice.<br/>It's impressive how fast Tazio could put the ideas together and how the project immediately found a shape that basically lasted till the end of the last playtest.<br/><br/>I am probably the one who playtested this game the most, so I am particularly satisfied and if Tazio is Beyond The Mirror's father, I feel a bit like its uncle. ^^<br/><br/>The resolution is extremely engaging, and some minor aspect - such as the new scene framed starting by deriving an aesthetic aspect from the ending bit of previous one - gives the whole game a cinematic peace that is really satisfying.<br/><br/>I have to admit I really like this game, probably more than mine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341294/#Comment_341294" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-01T17:00:44+00:00" title="September  1, 2011  5:00PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I super-like this game.

But you should add a website to help your game emerge from the mass.<br/>Otherwise IPR. I think they have higher margins, but of course it's a much more focused online shop.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341483/#Comment_341483" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-03T04:39:46+00:00" title="September  3, 2011  4:39AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the meantime I've created a <i>very</i> temporary page <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/thechiseledgear/" rel="nofollow">here</a> and you can view my blog <a href="http://chiseledgear.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/>In both I discuss about the progress in this game's publication.<br/><br/><br/>Whoa, thank you so much for the encouragement!!!!
