During that time, lots of folks who care a lot about this discussion have lamented various status issues.  I've never been quite sure what they're talking about.  It seems to me that, on the internet, folks who've published games that other people like get taken more seriously, and folks who are funny and cause trouble get more attention.  It's all kinda shrug-worthy to me, but it keeps coming up, so I feel like there must be things I'm missing.<br/><br/>So, I just had a thought about internet status yesterday, when Simon announced the release of his game <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14249&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  I saw the thread title.  I had four main reactions to it:<br/><span style="color: #000033;"><br/>On Mighty Thews -- I <b>recognize</b> that name.  I've heard it on the internet, but can't remember where.  Why do I remember it?  (Now I've got it!  I think I looked at the cover on the glyphpress design critique forum a while back.  I either gave feedback or at least thought about.  Visual + interaction = remembered.)<br/>I've <b>already invested</b> a little bit of caring about this game's success, by putting in the effort to stare at the cover, think about it, and try to provide constructive feedback.  I want to see if the thing I tried to help succeed did in fact do so.  It'd be especially cool if I saw evidence that I made a difference, though I don't expect that in this case.<br/>"On Mighty Thews" is a funny and evocative <b>title</b>.  Makes me think of the Promethea issue where badass Grace is talking about the drooling writers who wrote her stories in the 1920s, describing her "rippling thews".<br/><b>Simon C</b>:A) Simon's said a lot of stuff on the internet about RPGs that I found interesting, particularly about viewing non-Narr play through the lens of theme.  So I'm interested in seeing his work.B) He's also been generally pleasant and constructive-leaning on the internet, so I'm interested in being supportive.C) He also isn't famous, so I probably can't just wait around to see what lots of other people think about this game from playing it; I have to go look myself.</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323616/#Comment_323616" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T14:39:38+00:00" title="May  9, 2011  2:39PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 10, 2011 1:30AM by David_Berg.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<sup><b>POST 2 OF 7</b></sup><br/>So I opened the thread.  It doesn't take too much to get me to open a thread, but it doesn't take nothing either.<br/><br/>I then read the game blurb (in bold), with the following reactions:<br/><br/><b>Take your friends into the blood-soaked world of your own imaginations!</b><br/>Dammit, I know what a roleplaying game is!  This pitch isn't aimed at me; is there one that is?  Also, "blood-soaked" starts giving me an idea -- combined with the title, it has me thinking "slaughter the kobolds".  I'm, uh, not really into that.<br/><br/><b>Mighty warrior-heroes face mortal peril in a land of sword-fighting, strange cultures, monsters and magic. On Mighty Thews lets you and your friends tell bizzarre and bloody tales of swords and sorcery</b><br/>Ah.  So, a lot like what tended to happen when I played D&amp;D2 at age 13.  I'm certainly not grabbed by this concept so far, as there's nothing new or challenging there, but the blurb is short enough that I'll keep reading.<br/><br/><b>in a world of your own creation.</b> <br/>I do like the world-creation part of various indie RPGs.<br/><br/><b>Perfect for a casual and quick game, you can be playing within minutes of opening the book.</b><br/>I like trying new games, and if I can give one a worthy try in a single session, that's a boon for my group's logistics.  So this has a leg up in making the long, long list of "games to try at some point".  I don't pay money for that alone, though.<br/><br/>Two other games that do exactly what's been described thus far also jump to mind: <i>Swords Without Master</i> and <i>Final Hour of a Storied Age</i>.  So On Mighty Thews needs to distinguish itself ASAP...<br/><br/><b>On Mighty Thews is a pulp fantasy roleplaying game that\u2019s fast and easy to play.<br/>Adventure Awaits!</b><br/>You already told me that.<br/><br/>This is where I'd normally go do something else.  Not because I have enough info to think I won't like the game, but just because there are tons of games out there that, based on what I already know about them, give me better odds.  Plus there are free games.<br/><br/>So, what keeps me reading, and following links?  This takes me back to why I bothered in the first place (see numbered points from first post).<br/><span style="color: #000033;"><br/>1. Recognized the name.  Nope, not sufficient.  <br/><br/>2. Invested in success.  Yeah, that'd keep me around.  This has in fact been the case for <i>Final Hour of a Storied Age</i>.  For Thews, making one short comment on the cover means I haven't invested much, though.<br/><br/>3. Good name.  Nope, we're past that now.<br/><br/>4. Simon.  Yes!  I'm still curious to see what this particular internet voice does with pulp fantasy roleplay.</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323618/#Comment_323618" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T14:47:38+00:00" title="May  9, 2011  2:47PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 10, 2011 1:26AM by David_Berg.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<sup><b>POST 3 OF 7</b></sup><br/>Reading on, I see a link to "free downloads, news, and other stuff at the game's site".

Writing a pitch is tricky, and it's probably true I haven't got it exactly right. That said, I think you've got the main points. The game is:<br/><br/>a) Good for casual, pick-up play<br/>b) inflected with Swords and Sorcery tropes (this is a reference to the specific genre, which I assume you're familiar with)<br/>c) about violent conflict<br/><br/>There is more stuff you could know that would tell you whether you'll like the game, but it's kind of technical stuff about the resolution system. It's really hard to write that into a pitch and be clear about what you mean. Do you want to talk about that stuff?<br/><br/>EDIT: Actually, I'm interested in seeing the rest of this before I butt in, so go on!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323624/#Comment_323624" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T15:06:43+00:00" title="May  9, 2011  3:06PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 10, 2011 1:26AM by David_Berg.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<sup><b>POST 4 OF 7</b></sup><br/>Having clicked into Onmightythews.com, I go, "Oh no!

They are easy to read.  The text hierarchies and layout are clear.  Most of the text blocks are small enough to let me think that I can absorb this quickly going point by point.<br/><br/>The first page, <b>Making Characters and Starting Play</b> seems like a logical place to start.<br/><br/>Okay, <b>characters</b> get 6 descriptive traits assigned to various dice.  They're powerful masters of their own fates.  Write a name and description from there.  Seems quick and easy.  Nothing to get excited about yet.<br/><br/><b>Starting the game</b> looks similarly quick, easy, and generic.  Make up some neat locations, then pick which of them to play in.  "Poles of the world" is a neat concept, but I can't tell how that's being used here.  Maybe I'll ask Simon later.<br/><br/><b>Framing scenes, starting scenes, during scenes, ending scenes, tips:</b> this is all very well conceived, articulated, and organized, but 100% of it is stuff that's "well, duh" for me.  The goals, general techniques, and implied principles, are my defaults for "how to enjoy roleplaying".  They aren't the only approach, but they're a fairly non-controversial one.  Which has me thinking, "Cool, we're on the same page about the basics; now what are you offering me that I can't already do on my own?"  I don't mean that to be vastly demanding, like, "Give me some experience I could <i>never</i> have otherwise!"  I just mean I'm looking for what makes play unique, whether it be process, outcomes, tone, or whatever.<br/><br/>I wonder, is this simply a game for people who don't yet know how to roleplay?  Is it not for me?<br/><br/>I move on to the next page, <b>Dangerous and Competing Conflicts</b>, and scan the section headers.  Nothing jumps out to promise answers to my previous questions.  This is where I feel the urge to give up and spend my internet time doing something easier and more fun.  What stops me?  Let's check in on the "why bother" list again:<br/><span style="color: #000033;"><br/>1. Recognized.  Nope.<br/><br/>2. Invested.  Maybe.  Barely.  I wanted this game to be something cool.  I still don't know that it isn't.  But I'm losing faith that I'm going to see that is.  At this point, just asking Simon a short question might be better than reading on.  Or not, I dunno.<br/><br/>3. Name.  Nope.<br/><br/>4. Simon.  Yeah.  Why would a guy with interesting thoughts about gaming create such a generic game?

All that game nerd stuff.<br/><br/>But then I saw the other thread with the Pulp Primer and I downloaded that (it reads well on a phone!) and enjoyed reading it enough that I figured there had to be $5 worth of fun in the associated game.  So Simon got the sale from me.  To be honest, though, if the price point were any higher I probably would have overlooked it.<br/><br/>Based on my first read through of the game last night it's probably a good $5 spend.  Localizing the players' personalities on the collaborative map feels like true innovation -- the kind of innovation the marketing should reflect!  I'll know when I get it on the table in the next few weeks.<br/><br/>edit: and to address David's points about status: I don't know Simon IRL and forum posters I don't know IRL tend to all blur into a single amorphous entity, so his social status was not a factor in my decision to buy.

Why?</blockquote>\nLast few purchases:<br/><br/>1) For a <i>Polaris</i> PDF, I exchanged a few emails with Ben, then spent a few hours culling through some AP, organizing it all into one post, and posting on two sites.<br/><br/>2) For the <i>How We Came to Live Here</i> book, I exchanged a few emails with Brennan; organized, traveled to, and ran a one-shot of the game; wrote a review; sent a few more emails, and wrote another review.<br/><br/>3) I bought the <i>Burning Wheel</i> core books (system + character burner) at a local retailer.<br/><br/>4) I bought <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> at some con in 2008 or 2009.<br/><br/>5) I bought <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> online from IPR in 2007.<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>I bought <i>tSoY</i> because, of all the games the Forge hyped as being brilliant, revolutionary, and complete in ways that trad games weren't, it sounded most compatible with my tastes in fiction.  And it didn't sound as emo as Sorcerer.  I was disappointed, and became skeptical of Forge recommendations.<br/><br/>I bought <i>DitV</i> because the online chatter, accounts from friends, and back cover text all pointed to a laser-like focus on a certain goal for play.  I think a podcast interview with Ron and Vincent gave me the sense that play was inherently, constantly filled with tough calls on violence, and I wanted to see how that could be made to be the case.  This game also seemed like my best chance to find out what the hell Narrativism was.  <br/><br/>I bought <i>Burning Wheel</i> because, after playing tons of indie games that were purely made or broken by who was playing, I asked around about rules and structure that I could steal for my fantasy game, and a few folks (including one of the Evil Hat guys) suggested BW.<br/><br/>Since then, I've become poor, decided that I hate the way most game texts are formatted, met more friends with games I can borrow, and realized that I already have access to more games than I'll ever play.  Oh, and playtests of my stuff are more fun than most of 'em.<br/><br/>I did the work for <i>HWCTLH</i> for many, many reasons:<br/>1) I knew what I was getting.  I'd already played it.  I knew there were parts I loved.<br/>2) What did I love?  The color.  The way the color is integrated into character creation and the way things are named.  The relationship map.  The 2 GMs.<br/>3) First indie game I ever played!  As a playtest!  At my first ever con!  Soft spot for that.<br/>4) Huge invesment!  I spent 10+ hours doing an editing pass over an early draft and sending my comments to Brennan.  I felt that this effort went almost completely unappreciated, which left me slightly grumpy.  So it's worth noting that feeling slighted by a creator isn't enough to deter me from their product (at least at the cost of work, rather than money).<br/><br/>I did the work for <i>Polaris</i> because, after playing it, I thought maybe we'd missed out on an interesting relationship between mechanics and narration by doing it wrong.  So I wanted to check.  But I still haven't.<br/><br/>Of these 5 games, HWCTLH is the only one I've brought to a group or played from my copy of the book.  I've still never played tSoY (unless solar system hacks count).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>- What are your 3 favorite published RPGs (free counts if it is published)? Why?</blockquote>\nI have no idea.  Most of my best play experiences have been with unpublished games -- my games, and Land of Nodd.  I can name you 70 games that I loved some part of, but 0 that I loved all parts of.  I'll just go stream of consciousness here:<br/><br/>1) <i>Sign in Stranger</i>.  Narrating environmental sense data without meanings or explanations makes for truly unique experiences of (a) embodying a character, and (b) creating setting.  I'm also free to focus on the fiction rather than being forced to frequently interact with formal cues (at least, that's how it used to be; I hope that hasn't changed!).<br/><br/>2) <i>Primetime Adventures</i>.  I like chatting with my groups about what we want to do, I like explicit models from other fiction, I like conflict resolution around character issues, and of all the games that do those things, this one does it with the least other crap getting in the way.  I do hack it to set explicit stakes, though.<br/><br/>3) <i>FreeMarket</i> or <i>InSpectres</i>.  I love getting togther with friends, coming up with wacky ideas for projects, and pursuing them.  I particularly love doing this in fictional realities, where I can be bold, risky and impractical.  I love how both these games put me in a situation to do that.  FreeMarket's intrusive challenge mechanic annoys me, while InSpectres' open situation leaves me worried about GM-reliance.  I haven't played either enough to know which, if either, is a deal-breaker.

Amidst a gigantic field of RPGs of all sorts, how does one distinguish itself?  What's <i>On Mighty Thews</i>' unique niche?  Despite the fact that I'm aware that Robert E. Howard is not J. R. R. Tolkein, "Swords and Sorcery" struck me as a generic premise for a game.  <br/><br/>Maybe this is because I'm lazy?  Because I have no particular passion for S&amp;S?  Or is it because, if you just take old D&amp;D monster manuals, magic item lists, and character advancement rules, and let the GM wing a world, chances are decent that you get something vaguely S&amp;Sish?  I played many such games in my early RPG years, using <i>D&amp;D2</i>, <i>D&amp;D3</i>, <i>Warhammer FRP</i>, and one game that may actually be proper S&amp;S, <i>Stormbringer</i>.  Then there's <i>Spirit of the Century</i> marketing itself as "Pulp", which might included S&amp;S for all I know.<br/><br/>I don't know if this holds for the broader audience of game customers, but for me, if you know something about Sword &amp; Sorcery that I'm <i>not</i> getting from all these other games, I'd really like you to tell me what it is.  Hopefully in a short, memorable phrase.  <i>Then</i> your game will have a fiction/color niche in my mind.  For me, <i>Swords Without Master</i> is "the narration-passing game" first and "S&amp;S" second.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/edheil" title="edheil"><img alt="edheil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/edheil">edheil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323785/#Comment_323785" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-10T13:40:54+00:00" title="May 10, 2011  1:40PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Or is it because, if you just take old D&amp;D monster manuals, magic item lists, and character advancement rules, and let the GM wing a world, chances are decent that you get something vaguely S&amp;Sish?

If people start with D&amp;D as their frame of reference, they're mentally trying to answer the question "is this like D&amp;D?". When you offer examples of what is in S&amp;S, the person with the D&amp;D frame of reference will mentally respond by saying "yes, I've seen that in D&amp;D, so this must be like D&amp;D". People have been responding with the "so it's generic fantasy?" to my <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/final-hour-of-a-storied-age/" rel="nofollow">epic fantasy game</a>, too. It's obvious to me that epic fantasy and S&amp;S are on different sides of a spectrum and therefore are strongly differentiated, but for someone who doesn't have enough points of reference the distinctions aren't obvious at all. It's generally easier to draw the distinction if you talk about what's <i>not</i> in the genre, but that's not always easy to do in a way that's not off-putting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323793/#Comment_323793" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-10T14:08:10+00:00" title="May 10, 2011  2:08PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is good stuff!<br/><br/>One reason I made the "<a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1164498/Pulpy%20Primer.pdf" rel="nofollow">Pulpy Primer</a>" (also included in the back of the book) was because in playtesting I found that "Sword and Sorcery" was not as instantly recognizable a genre as I had imagined. One playtest went pretty wonky because one of the players thought of David Eddings and Terry Brooks as her reference for pulp fantasy. I think that not as many people have read Howard and Lieber and Lee and Moorcock et. al. as I first thought.<br/><br/>The things that distinguish On Mighty Thews, in my mind, are the following:<br/><br/>- Quick, casual play. It works well with no prep, a small group, and a short session.<br/>- Sword and Sorcery, as opposed to "High" fantasy, or D&amp;D's new "Dungeonpunk" thing.<br/>- "No-myth" play, with all players having limited plot, narrational, and content authority.<br/><br/>Probably <i>Swords Without Master</i> fills this niche as well, but I feel the niche is big enough for both of us.<br/><br/>David, I think that last bullet point is probably the one that's least well communicated in my original material. It's also, from what I know of your gaming preferences, likely to be a turn-off for you, yeah? "World-breaking" and all.

My first campaign character was a sadist who became the patron deity of beer.  Our GMs likewise came up with the most badass, scary, disgusting and weird monsters they could.<br/><br/>When I played <i>Swords Without Master</i> with Eppy, my scary necromancer toted his glowing dragonfly staff into an underground city of the damned to fight their serpent god.  Not so different.<br/><br/>I'm mentioning this only because it seems to me like what <i>any</i> 12-year-old boy would do.  So I'd imagine many players have a similar familiarity.

It's a little crazy how little is understood about the genre distinction.

The true hotsauce for me is an elegant game with an attractive premise -- something like BSG or Railroad Tycoon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323871/#Comment_323871" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-11T02:02:28+00:00" title="May 11, 2011  2:02AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite><br/><b>- "No-myth" play, with all players having limited plot, narrational, and content authority.</b><br/>As opposed to what?

I wanted to talk about niches, marketing, and status.<br/><br/><b>Niches</b><br/><br/>It sounds like there are indeed folks who know what "Sword &amp; Sorcery" means, are excited by it, and don't feel that that niche in their gaming is already well filled.  And it sounds like folks are in fact checking out the game on that basis.  What are the takeaways here?  That small but well-labeled genres are golden?  That just because a genre sounds generic to some doesn't mean it's actually over-served for its true fans?<br/><br/><b>Marketing</b><br/><br/>I think I've exhaustively covered my personal response, and put that in the context of my personal history.  Hopefully someone with actual marketing experience can infer some takeaways.  Or maybe it's just that (a) the list of things you could do to market better is extremely long, and (b) pitches need to showcase the unique strengths of your game in a way that readers can immediately connect to actual play?<br/><br/><b>Status</b><br/><br/>Going on the internet and being pleasant and saying interesting and thoughtful things about roleplaying at least gets you <i>some</i> attention and benefit of the doubt from people who agree with some of your insights and appreciate pleasantness.  I'd like to throw in fewer qualifiers, but I don't want my "let's all be friends in an intellectual meritocracy!" instincts to bias this.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323943/#Comment_323943" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-11T14:21:06+00:00" title="May 11, 2011  2:21PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 11, 2011 2:32PM by stefoid.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ignore this post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323949/#Comment_323949" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-11T14:42:04+00:00" title="May 11, 2011  2:42PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite><b>Status</b><br/><br/>Going on the internet and being pleasant and saying interesting and thoughtful things about roleplaying at least gets you<i>some</i>attention and benefit of the doubt from people who agree with some of your insights and appreciate pleasantness.

Does this make me more likely to <i>buy</i> his game? Not really. (Though I did, because I also love the underrepresented S-and-S genre.) Does it make me more likely at least <i>to check out</i> his game in greater depth? Definitely. He's earned my respect, though I've never even met (or really had a conversation) with the guy. That makes a difference for sure.*<br/><br/>Also, as far as marketing-- the Pulp Primer was golden on selling me, as others have said.<br/><br/>*I've decided not even to look at games before because I disliked the people who were involved with them. Sorry if that makes me seem callous; it's just one of the side effects of a tiny niche hobby. Indie games are more closely associated with their creators than other rpgs, by definition. That comes with advantages and disadvantages alike, one of which is that I can be turned off by an abrasive or obnoxious personality, regardless of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323969/#Comment_323969" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-11T16:33:43+00:00" title="May 11, 2011  4:33PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 11, 2011 4:33PM by stefoid.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe the pulpy primer should be the first couple of pages of the book then?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>On Mighty Thews - games niches, marketing and status - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14262/on-mighty-thews-games-niches-marketing-and-status/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="On Mighty Thews - games niches, marketing and status - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14262/on-mighty-thews-games-niches-marketing-and-status/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Oh!

The rules assume a group that's already committed to making a sword and sorcery story, and then gives them a rules framework that makes that compelling and interesting - preserving the in-fiction conflicts of interest against the unity of interest of the group.<br/><br/>The "d20 Trait" mechanic is a good example of this. Your character has a trait that represents a core duality within them. "Civilised" for example, or "Fatalistic". When you act according to that trait, you get a re-roll token at the end of each scene. When you act against that trait, you get to roll a d20 in a conflict. So the civilised barbarian, when pressed, can revert to savagery and gain the advantage. The doomed hero can, in the heat of battle, defy their fatalistic nature and triumph.<br/><br/>Those things are possible without the d20 trait mechanic, but what the rule does is push that theme to the forefront - it makes us take notice of how the character is acting in terms of their thematic issue. The game responds to fiction that suits its core themes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324019/#Comment_324019" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-11T19:45:32+00:00" title="May 11, 2011  7:45PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lumpley</cite>Oh!

Of the people who were drawn by Simon, most mentioned the fact that he's been pleasant and said something interesting on the internet.<br/><br/>I want to emphasize <b>interesting</b> as opposed to <b>smart</b>.<br/><br/>I think we are absolutely flooded with <b>smart</b>.  We have too many smart people discussing and making games to even remember their smartness.<br/><br/><b>Interesting</b>, on the other hand, can be more distinctive, because it's a matter of taste.  By expressing what we care about most passionately in gaming, and sharing our takes on that, and doing that over and over, we find like-minded folks.<br/><br/>For example, I care about exploration-and-discovery play.  I know that Gareth (contracycle on the Forge) does too.  I know it because he posts about it a lot, and I've seen some of those posts, and interacted with some too.  He's said enough stuff I already agreed with to show me we're on the same page, and enough stuff I hadn't thought of to make me want to hear more.  If he designs a game, he's automatically got my attention.  Likewise if he starts a thread on some exploratory play topic.<br/><br/>I guess this all sounds pretty obvious, but in my eyes it's a good thing that doesn't get talked about much, so I just wanted to say it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324049/#Comment_324049" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-12T03:26:08+00:00" title="May 12, 2011  3:26AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon, I've posted a question about that d20 trait mechanic in the other thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324052/#Comment_324052" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-12T03:39:16+00:00" title="May 12, 2011  3:39AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David,<br/><br/>I want to thank you for starting this thread.

(they were great).  The overwhelming majority of fantasy Ive been exposed to by book and film has been the generic medieval europe kind setting.<br/><br/>I think its the visual concept that attracts me.  Like good memories of from a mix of all the sci-fi novel covers I used to devour as a kid, that makes me go 'yes, S&amp;S is great' without really having a conscious reason to back it up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324178/#Comment_324178" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-12T15:49:55+00:00" title="May 12, 2011  3:49PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are some great stories that are now in the public domain:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/32850/32850-h/32850-h.htm" rel="nofollow">The Tree of Life</a> by C.

History is sketchier then so there is a more 'anything goes, people are doing this for the first time' feel to it.  Whereas medieval settings are just known quantities down to the last stone.  Its like a scary movie is always scarier when you dont know what it is, but once something is fully defined, it loses you have nothing left to imagine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324235/#Comment_324235" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-12T18:54:25+00:00" title="May 12, 2011  6:54PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Epidiah Ravachol</cite><cite>Posted By: Rafu</cite><cite>Posted By: lumpley</cite>stuff</blockquote>\nI think you're spot on.<br/>I, too, am agreeing with this.<br/>I feel sandwiched between Recognized &amp; Respected Designers\u2122.
