Now, sure, EVE is a hardcore sandbox and very PVP heavy at least beyond safe space. But at the same time, it allows you to play a character that never, ever fights, and still fulfill an important role in the game. (Not to mention become better and all that.)<br/><br/>So where in something like WoW, there is absolutely no levelling without killing, EVE allows you to earn your money (In EVE Money is basically how you become better. Money and time, anyway.) by nice and friendly means like mining, transporting stuff from A to B and good old trading. So not only is a full-time Trader (Or miner, hauler, whatever.) a pretty good concept for a character, the game even supports you in that with Quests specifically for these activities, allowing you to gain ressources like loyalty points like other mission-runners, only without killing.<br/><br/>Now, just mining all the time can be somewhat boring (I'm playing a Miner, can you tell?), but still, killing stuff is not necessary like it is in other MMOs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150417/#Comment_150417" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T07:53:54+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  7:53AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I designed a Facebook MMORPG that involves little elves running around building communities, helping people with problems, and cheering up grumpy monsters while doing every nonviolent thing they can think of to resist the forces of Chaos.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd" title="SweeneyTodd"><img alt="SweeneyTodd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd">SweeneyTodd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150448/#Comment_150448" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T09:18:17+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  9:18AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2008 9:24AM by SweeneyTodd.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That Facebook idea reminds me of my recent Warcraft experiences, wherein I learned that the community-building and morale issues are much more "the game" when it comes to large-group raiding. If those challenges are addressed well, the actual "Shoot monster to get loot" bit is almost an afterthought. If they're not, your work is cut out for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Of course, most people in those kinds of raids don't recognize this, leading to the popular interpretation that guilds "just work" unless someone injects "drama", which reminds me very much of the idea that a roleplaying game just works unless someone causes trouble. In both cases, the person bringing an issue to the group's attention is typically blamed for the issue, whether or not it originates with them.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI always found it interesting that the folks who were really good at the networking and community-building often played healers. Is there an element of "healer is a nurturing role, and I'm a person interested in that?" Is there an element of "Groups need a healer, so I can network more effectively by filling that role for people?" My anecdotal experience tells me that the healers who were focused on the community-building element were extremely good at the job of healing, which may be apropros of nothing. (In a past MMO I played a support caster who literally couldn't kill anything on his own, he simply managed the chaos of the battle through buffs and crowd control, and I actually realized that I had to community-build to get the most use out of my abilities, and that I enjoyed doing so. Kinda neat emergent behavior.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI fully recognize that "Not killing, but helping other people kill" isn't what you're referring to here. I just find it interesting how people have carved out niches that fulfill their interests in games that pretty much fail to explictly acknowledge those interests.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150514/#Comment_150514" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T11:33:22+00:00" title="June 13, 2008 11:33AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://enterzon.com/" rel="nofollow">Zon</a> is designed to teach Chinese (Mandarin) through language immersion.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: merb101</cite>I actually had a similar discussion with a co-worker on how you could do a pen-and-paper version of Animal Crossing.

I hope that someone makes an attempt at it anyway.  I totally want to be an assistant Cardassian tailor with a shady past.

I remember that (played the first two).  I also dug that about the Thief series as well. Sure, you could *murder* dudes, but you can also get around by knocking them out.<br/><br/>That's one thing I really didn't like about the GTA series (FWIW, I can't recall if I actually finished any of them other than the 80s one; I mostly just used it to drive around crazy while listening to my thumpin' mp3s) was the fact that you couldn't get from mission to mission without absolutely killing people. <br/><br/>Like in the third one, we see CJ walk into a room where another dude from his gang is shooting up.  "You want some?"<br/>"Naw man, I don't roll with that".<br/>I'm like "Cool, that's interesting. Well, actually, it's probably a censorship thing, but still... he's not into drugs! Rock!"<br/>...but then they're like, "Hey CJ wanna go kill like some senator and his girlfriend?" and he's like, "FUCK. YEAH. Do I have to drive them off a pier, or can't I just stab them in the face with an icepick? CMON I NEED TO GET MY GUN OFF."<br/><br/>I thought it would have been so awesome if, frex, on the "you must drive a senator and his girlrfiend/wife off a pier" scenario, if you could just instead of actually killing them, like drive to the edge of town (even if it was 3 times harder) and let them out, saying "You're dead, never let them find you" and let them go.<br/><br/>Aaaaaaaanyway...<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150764/#Comment_150764" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-14T13:00:21+00:00" title="June 14, 2008  1:00PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2008 1:01PM by Josh Roby.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like WoW because "death" is just a run back from the graveyard.

Didn't the game suggest to you the moment to moment fun is killing evil, rather than bothering evil? I could accept and see the fun of a game where it's about making evil have to jog all the time, but it's presented as the fun of killing. Makes it hard to get over that 'I'm a mass murderer' idea.<br/><br/>I'd rather hoped in LOTRO they had an option to knock out rather than kill.

I'm waiting for a game where if your character is about to die, instead circumstances are made such that a friend of your characters dies. NPC Friendships would be something you cultivate during play due to mechanics (and your character is restricted to a safe zone until he develops a friendship). I think the obvious route would to be to make the NPC friends sympathetic characters - so it really bloody hurts when they die! <img alt="&gt;:)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/naughty.png" title="&gt;:)"/><br/><br/>Eh, another thing that bugs me in EVE is the escape pod. It seems vindictive for other players to kill you that way. Sure, it puts another competitor even further behind, so I see the tactic. But in terms of game design, why can't they just make no escape pod - you just die on ship explosion? It's like these few seconds where mercy could be given and you as a player can't do anything (your in a shitty escape pod). Then your killed anyway. It's a real non game moment, where you've lost but lets string you along for a bit longer with hope of mercy in a merciless game. It just rubs it in, when if that's going to happen, it should be at the social level or not at all. Perhaps it's a hang over from the PVE combat, where you can 'pod and escape, usually.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150942/#Comment_150942" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-15T20:42:53+00:00" title="June 15, 2008  8:42PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I understand it, the person killing you doesn't HAVE to podkill you. They just usually do, because the kind of person that's going to gatecamp to destroy newbies in their frigates is the sort who wants to make you lose any uninsured skills, too. It's not because you're a potential competitor. In these situations, you couldn't be a threat to them if you had forewarning and adequate time to target them with your weapon systems and move in for the attack. You won't possibly be a competitor for some time, and by that time, they'll have moved on to other newbies, and they'll likely have faded into the mass of faceless podkillers you've endured to get there.<br/><br/>This attitude transcends killing in MMORPGs. Most of the people who play for this kind of thrill won't avoid a game simply because it has no killing. They'll find other ways to dominate the new and unexperienced, to cause feelings of helpless anger.<br/><br/>I'd personally like to see an MMO that equalizes matters.. So that no matter how much more experienced you are, or how much of a situational advantage you have, there's always that chance that the victim can become the victor. And it needs to hurt the griefer as much as it hurts the griefed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150964/#Comment_150964" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-16T00:30:47+00:00" title="June 16, 2008 12:30AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I were to design an mmorpg I would put a "crazy button" on every new character.

I say that knowing these gate campers are drooling bullies, essentially. The thing is, from a gamist perspective, when you enter a mmorpg you know these people are going to be playing too, because the game isn't too picky about who it allows to play. They are part of 'mmo' play because the design is indescrimnant about who gets to play. They are part of the challenge your taking up. Or don't take the challenge.<br/><br/>In a whole new mmo game, yeah, it's good to have a new idea like yours or Clint's. But not an existing game - either embrace it for what it is, warts and all, or decline the challenge. I'd say. Then again I guess I'm rejecting part of how it's done, but I don't see anything except dragging out the moment between ship death and character death.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151002/#Comment_151002" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-16T08:10:45+00:00" title="June 16, 2008  8:10AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Callan, <br/><br/>Absolutely.

So a brand new MMO for these features, yes.<br/><br/>Further, I'm absolutely on board with accepting that these sorts of people exist. As further part of my ideal MMO design, I've included open PVP (in the sense that Ultima Online used to have it, with "civilized" safe areas, and everywhere else fair game). I hate PKs/gankers. I'm not a big fan of PVP at all really.
