Maybe it's just my own reaction, but I feel like people sometimes give way too much attention to coming up with hard choices and then trying to fit the story around them. It's a bit like the thing that happens when you have a DM who says "ooh! I have this really really cool idea for a story, so I'm gonna make it happen this way" and then you get frustration because the DM wants to tell a story that the players aren't cooperating with.<br/><br/>It's the notion that the ideas you come up with before the session are never going to fit as well or be as meaningful as the ideas that you bring to bear as a result of the events in the session. Prepping a session for hard choices is all about pitting values against one another in the abstract: it's in play that you see the particulars come out.<br/><br/>I guess I'd put it like this--situations are unpredictable, so don't prep situations. The details will sort themselves out. You create hard choices by figuring out what characters value. Then, you put those into conflict during the session.<br/><br/>e.g., Burning Wheel, Dogs in the Vineyard, even some Powered by the Apocalypse games like Sagas of the Icelanders and Monsterhearts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semiomant" title="semiomant"><img alt="semiomant" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semiomant">semiomant</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436772/#Comment_436772" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-09T10:19:33+00:00" title="August  9, 2014 10:19AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I disagree (in a friendly manner) that prep'd ideas are *never* as meaningful as spontaneous events. Let's not deal in absolutes. Either way might produce fine results. In my experience preparing ideas and themes, having ideas how they interconnect, while being open how this concretely play out gives *me* the best results.<br/><br/>I think a book of dilemmas, or hard choices is a nice idea. It gives you a vocabulary (patterns) to build with. then it provides a few dozen expamles (like screencast implementations for programming), ranging from strongly guided ones with only one chokepoint for decisions, to very open ones.<br/>My reason I like this is that you get better at cooking from following recipes, and better at jamming by practice with sheet music.

Not one with a scripted rail of events, just a description of a place and the weird things therein.<br/><br/>We had a moment which I afterwards called my mom to tell her about (I left home when I was 16 and I\u2019m more than twice that now, so... talk to her seldomly) because it was so awesome.<br/>We had found a mirror in the dungeon which was covered. We didn\u2019t dare to look in the mirror. Intead we carried it with us. Much later, we came to some frog monsters. We showed them the mirror and they disappeared and then the mirror shattered!<br/>I found out later that this mirror, and what would happen to whoever was the first to look in it, was part of the module as written. The game suddenly felt very meaningful and \u201creal\u201d.<br/>This dungeon with all its levers and masonry and turn-counting and wandering monsters feels like a coherent (not realistic, but coherent) system to interact with and I had never experienced anything like it before but many times since.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436812/#Comment_436812" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T00:15:20+00:00" title="August 10, 2014 12:15AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To clarify, I was answering \u201cwhy is there little support3 for this in role-playing games?\u201d (with: \u201cRPGs can work without being about story\u201d).<br/>I didn\u2019t mean to ingore this:<br/>\u201cThe Monster Manual, but filled with ethical questions/thought experiments?\u201d<br/>which is very relevant to the type of games that <em>are</em> about story, and such games do exist.<br/>That would be a useful tool, to be sure.
