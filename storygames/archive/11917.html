The theme for one day of the institute is going to be "The Humanist Idea of the Well-Rounded Person." The central texts we'll be using will be Castiglione's <i>The Book of the Courtier</i> and the "What a noble mind is here o'erthrown" soliloquiy from <i>Hamlet</i>.<br/><br/>"I am sure," I told my colleagues (who are warily fascinated by my nerdy gaming obsession) "that I can find an indie RPG set in the High Middle Ages/Renaissance/Enlightenment with a chargen process that nicely illustrates some of the ideals of this brand of humanism. I will take up an hour of the day helping the teachers to make up characters, then run them through maybe half an hour of a sample scenario."<br/><br/>Sitting at my desk after the meeting it has occurred to me that I might have been bullshitting them just a tad.<br/><br/>So, um, <i>help</i>! Can anyone think of a game that might fit this bill, or one that could easily be adapted to do so?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266092/#Comment_266092" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-08T08:16:39+00:00" title="April  8, 2010  8:16AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe <b><a href="http://www.tiltingatwindmills.net/alfresco/" rel="nofollow">Four Colors al Fresco</a></b>?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266094/#Comment_266094" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-08T08:21:36+00:00" title="April  8, 2010  8:21AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2010 8:22AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally I'd build something that does exactly what you need, rather than kitbashing another game.

"Here's a scribbly little ruleset I just came up with" is much less likely to draw them in than "here's a shiny .pdf with real art, designed by a respected member of the indie gaming community (i.e. not really me) that others across the country have played and found enjoyable."<br/><br/>Chargen is realy the whole point of the exercise, so it would have to be a system that constructs character more narratively than just via the generation of stats. There'll be somewhere between eight and fifteen teachers taking part, in a University lecture hall, for two hours max. If we do get in any gameplay, they'll probably have to be broken into groups.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
