I now have a quote from them and it comes to $1528(\xc2\xa3790) for a 500 deck run with 100 of those sent to the states and 400 sent to my home address in the uk. That price includes the shipping. <br/><br/>I am now hoping to retail the game for about \xc2\xa310 a deck with a \xc2\xa35 - \xc2\xa36 retail price point. Hopefully this should be out by Dragonmeet, which is nice. I think for the states this will need to be around $15 rather than $20 but I was wondering what you guys think. The game is 60 cards, full colour, with tuck box and rules.<br/><br/>Break even for the run is going to be about 100 decks, dependent on where they are sold and I reckon I can make a profit of about $6k(\xc2\xa33k) on the run.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>Iain                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94649/#Comment_94649" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T08:39:11+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  8:39AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Congratulations, Iain!

Four color printing on front and back.  It looks gorgeous.<br/><br/>Gloom is in this category (it's on clear cards) and it has cards that look like this:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://imgred.com/http://images.boardgamegeek.com/images/pic51338_lg.jpg"/><br/><br/>...while not in full color, it looks totally awesome.<br/><br/><br/>For a card game around $10-$12, I'm still expecting a 110 card game that looks good or a 55 card game that looks awesome.<br/><br/>Bang! is in this category (110 cards, looks good) and it has cards that look like this:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://imgred.com/http://images.boardgamegeek.com/images/pic209835_md.jpg"/><br/><br/>Dungeoneer is in this category as well, and this 55 card expansion has cards that look like this:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://imgred.com/http://images.boardgamegeek.com/images/pic154735_md.jpg"/><br/><br/><br/>As a purchaser of a card game, I'm not willing to cut a game the same amount of slack as I would a RPG designer just because the designer is doing a short print run or isn't a big company.  If you're putting a $20 card game out there, it's got to have high production values and have the same shelf presence as other games at that price point.  If I saw your game with 60 cards (and I have to ask, why such an odd number?  Most printers use 55 card sheets.  It seems like you're wasting resources you're paying for.), if I saw your game with 60 cards sitting on a game shelf in the same size box that a deck of regular playing cards come in, I'm probably not even going to look at it.  Especially when I see the $14.95 price tag.<br/><br/>My gut feeling is a card game that comes in a box the size of a deck of standard playing cards shouldn't be more than $7.99 retail.<br/><br/>My friend has a game called High School Drama!.  It comes in a smaller than standard size for board games.  He was surprised to find that vendors and distributors at trade shows would come up and feel the heft of the box to determine if they'd carry it.  If it felt heavy to them, it's a good game to carry at the $23 price point.  If it was lighter -- as crazy as it sounds -- not as many people would have carried the game.  This is why when I see Bang! (110 cards) in a box that's twice the size as a standard card deck, I'm thinking I'm getting a good deal for $10.95.  If the Dodge City expansion came in a smaller box that was the actual size of the expansion deck (65 cards), I'd think that $10.95 would be a ripoff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D" title="Thomas D"><img alt="Thomas D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://landfill.thesnakefarm.com/images/misc/idescols.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D">Thomas D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94827/#Comment_94827" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T14:57:00+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  2:57PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2007 2:58PM by Thomas D.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, whatever you do, make sure you get a proof copy before they print the final run.

Bmovie has been playtested a lot and works incredibly well with 60 cards.I was unaware of the 55 cards per sheet thing and will talk to Avalon about that. I could make the deck bigger but it would just be a matter of putting 2 of every card in the deck, which means repetition of titles, which means a potentially more boring game etc.<br/><br/>I only plan to distribute through IPR in the states initially so people will be aware of the more indie nature of the game. I am planning to go through esdevium over here and \xc2\xa310 seems to be an ok price point for a 60 card game.<br/><br/>Thanks for your advice Thomas.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>Iain                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D" title="Thomas D"><img alt="Thomas D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://landfill.thesnakefarm.com/images/misc/idescols.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D">Thomas D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94840/#Comment_94840" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T15:54:33+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  3:54PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If the game is released through IPR or sold electronically, you'll have the benefit of not having other similar card games on the same display shelf (or product page) competing for your customer.  This is a good move for an indie card game that I hadn't thought of -- you're isolating potential customers to your product only, which should increase sales.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>Trying to compete with the big names of card game production in retail is a good way to lose a lot of money.</blockquote>\nYep.
