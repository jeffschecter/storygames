Enough so, that I was ALMOST willing to play it unhacked despite my dislike of 4e...until they got to the whole collectible card bits. Not a big fan of how that works, at least for the powers. The way the cards work for OmegaTech makes sense, with them being items and such, and being able to be used up. But the idea of switching through different powers? It makes me think of it too much as a RIFTS/Magic: The Gathering hybrid. I really hate the idea of players building their own, custom power and omega tech decks. Randomization I'm okay with, but when you start the whole deck-building thing, it stops becoming a roleplaying game, and instead becomes a CCG in my eyes.<br/><br/>So, unless you like collectible card games, start off by making a house rule that the Game Master holds all the cards, and maybe players just gain new powers as they advance, and they don't switch out (but instead are limited-use in comparison to their Origin powers). So one power card at level 1, two at level 4, etc.<br/><br/>When presenting it to your players, they don't need to know what Gamma World is (especially since this is almost nothing like the previous Gamma Worlds). Just give them the Big Mistake history as presented in the book, and that should give them a good idea. Or, if they're familiar with Paranoia, treat it like a variant of that, except the players are the people NOT inside Alpha Complex that the Computer keeps warning loyal citizens about. You could force them all to watch Tank Girl for some inspiration.<br/><br/>If they've played any of the old Palladium Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles/After the Bomb games, all you'd have to do is reference that, since they kind of have the same feel, too.<br/><br/>In the meantime, I'm thinking of hacking all of the Origins and a bunch of the powers and tech into Danger Patrol.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306122/#Comment_306122" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-28T09:57:10+00:00" title="December 28, 2010  9:57AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, im setting aside the idea of custom power decks for players, but I like the wackiness of shifting powers, so Im keeping the card draw mechanic for the GM's deck. Thing is, I doubt any of my players would even be interested in collecting their own power cards, so I would still be supplying the cards to everyone anyway. If they really want their own deck, I will just randomly split the GM deck and give a hunk o cards to each player at the start of the game.<br/><br/><br/><i>"You could force them all to watch Tank Girl for some inspiration."</i><br/><br/>Man, talk about a killer GM <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306124/#Comment_306124" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-28T10:19:51+00:00" title="December 28, 2010 10:19AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Design or find a new character sheet.

Not so fond of the digital-style font of the character sheet, but otherwise much more functional than what was originally provided. And as for the Character Creation Guide? That helped a heck of a lot. Not that making a character is that difficult, but that fourth page that describes the differences between Gamma World and 4e is nice. They should have plastered that on the front of the game boxes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306205/#Comment_306205" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-29T07:14:27+00:00" title="December 29, 2010  7:14AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lots of great links and advice, thanks <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I really like some of the setting teasers in the main book, like the tower that is kept standing due to the giant sentient plant which inhabits it.

When the players are making their characters, make sure they start as friends/comrades/fellow members of something, and that their group has a particular void they are trying to fill, whether that is making money, finding a particular pre-Mistake medicine that will cure the plague in their village, hunting down a former friend who killed another one of their friends, etc. Make sure they have "wants" and "needs" of their own that are defined, too, so that you can every now and then throw them a clue to something that interests them ("When you examine the remains of the emaciated Badder, you notice the trinket hanging around his neck is actually a pristine AI chip...maybe there are more where that comes from?")                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306244/#Comment_306244" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-29T11:12:03+00:00" title="December 29, 2010 11:12AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just picked up GW.
