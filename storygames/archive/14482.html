Everyone thinks railroading is something different. It's like "unplayable". It's entirely in the eye of the beholder. Scene framing (even "you're at the front door of the dungeon") is railroading. It's not objectionable or bad, but it is railroading. This is why you are getting ridiculously diverse answers that include both good things and bad things.<br/><br/>I like how a lot of these assume that GMs have no feelings about how they want the game

I learned a lot.<br/><br/>* Take a lot of time preplanning the presentation, keying it to moments you've already scripted, so that you can feel justified forcing people to go on your rails. E.g., develop a soundtrack for the game.<br/><br/>* If the rulesystem doesn't really permit railroading, break the rules. When this fails because the players complain, tell them you're doing it right and rely on social discomfort to prevent any of them from pursuing the matter further. E.g., if a player has something on his sheet that says he can pull one less block, you change the facts you presented after-the-fact so you were always right anyway.<br/><br/>* Have a failure to notice something be a key ingredient to the next part of your story happening, then throw out details that people have no reason to pay attention to and punish them for missing them. This has the benefit of letting you feel like you've been fair, and to feel free to mock them for missing it. E.g., the pilots are guarding 12 trucks and you keep talking about how there are 12 trucks, then at some point say there are 8. <br/><br/>* When a player goes off script, never ever tell her that you're not prepared or comfortable. Instead, find of in-fiction reasons why she really ought to know better and if she continues to insist on doing something that seems perfectly reasonable, then cut her out of the game and don't go back to her  for a few hours. Remember that punishment is as important to a good game as killing her independent spirit. Why not join them?<br/><br/>* Crucially, DO NOT pick a game system that allows people to get around your blocking of them by possessing other independent skills. This, sadly, was the one area in which the master railroader of my example failed to utterly lock things down. Next time, maybe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul" title="Irminsul"><img alt="Irminsul" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul">Irminsul</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329689/#Comment_329689" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T12:46:50+00:00" title="June 14, 2011 12:46PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2011 12:47PM by Irminsul.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not rolling dice:<br/><br/>The GM knows the desired result and <i>makes</i> it happen.

The one-times-too-many was when "the way" was for a female character of a female player to fuck a PNG very dear to the GM. I and the other players tried for at least 3 sessions to find a way around this but the GM was irremovable. It has to be said that the player was the GM's  wife, but she didn't like the idea a bit anyway)<br/><br/>- The adventures is about the GM's powerful PNG, the player are there to look and be awed (I hope I never did this as a GM, but it's present in a lot of D&amp;D modules. the end of "Desert of Desolation" for example).<br/><br/>- The "Evil One" will destroy the world if you don't stop him.

The Ghost guarding the entrance can only speak to a woman...too bad all the PCs are boys, they'll just have to fight him (and probably loose).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329806/#Comment_329806" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T20:50:14+00:00" title="June 14, 2011  8:50PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2011 8:51PM by James_Nostack.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here is how I did it this weekend for a science-fiction one-shot:<br/>\n<br/>\n"You are on a space station.

Choices have consequences, etc. Provided such a choice follows the principle Do What the Fiction Demands, I see no issue with it.<br/>If you don't come in to talk to the moleman, maybe he follows you, or tells others that no-good trespassers are in the woods. <br/>Maybe you could take out the Royal Knights, and then that's just the opening that a peasant rebellion was waiting for to depose the

The rest I reckon should work given the right group and context, if not pushed too far. Some will engender a long-standing antipathy between you and your players. Some of these are only "horse to water" techniques, but after that why not booby trap the party into submission?<br/><br/>FORESHADOWING VIA TIME-TRAVEL<br/>The party see their future selves trying to fandoogle the McGuffin. It is clear from the situation that this is of vital importance. Shortly after they stumble accross a time-portal. If you can get them through the portal, then you have them eating out of your hands from then until the McGuffin is finally fandoogled.<br/><br/>FORESHADOWING VIA WAVING PRETTY STUFF AND PROMISES AT YOUR PLAYERS<br/>Let's say you have a super cool picture of an ancient Aztec temple with live sacrifices, a lizard king, a handful of white slaves in feather bikinis and battle harness clad dino-riders. Wave it under your players faces at the start of the session and tell them that this is where they are going to end up. They would be rude not to follow your rails after that.<br/><br/>LOOK AT WHAT I SHELLED OUT FOR, DON'T TELL ME I'VE WASTED ALL THAT MONEY<br/>Expensive unless you're on very good terms with the local game-store owner, and as long as your players fail to notice the book is still in its shrink wrap. Should work well in conjuntion with the previous item.<br/><br/>THIS IS WHAT YOU SAID YOU WANTED - MAYBE WITH JUST A TOUCH OF BAIT AND SWITCH<br/>Ask the players what the would like to do in the next session. Try to do this with leading questions, such as what sort of monster they would like to fight. If they say 'dragons' then you know that any kind of plot lead that hints at dragon involvement will be leapt on. See how long you can string them along before they start getting suspicious.<br/><br/>MASS TRANSIT METHODS<br/>Probably more effective with ocean liners or spaceships than trains. Make sure the best way the PC's have to get anywhere is by some sort public transport. They are then captive for the rest of the journey, without feeling they need escape or turn on their 'captors'. You can bung plot hook charlies at them like confetti, and if this is all done in club class the players are less likely to slaughter the poor blighters out of hand.<br/><br/>IN SPACE NO-ONE CAN COMPLAIN ABOUT AN EMERGENCY STOPOVER<br/>Ships can be forced to make emergency stops at the port of your choice. They can be forced to make a diversion to a more out of the way port of your choice. They can be mangled up by a gigantic [space] octopus leaving the PCs stranded on the desert island [or planet] of your choice.<br/><br/>YOU'RE IN THE ARMY NOW<br/>It is probably best as a premise for the campaign as a whole. A lot of games have this hard coded into the ruleset. <i>Timemaster </i> had the PCs going back in time to foil evil four armed shape-shifting aliens and their time-meddling schemes. <i>3:16</i> and <i>Requiem</i> inserts them directly into a no questions asked "follow the plot my little underlings" chain of command. As noted already, if you try to lay this on the players during the game, then their immediate superiors tend to become their most immediate adversary, which spoils the whole point.<br/><br/>TAKE THEIR TOYS AWAY<br/>Take away one of the characters most prized possession. They will go chase it to the ends of the earth. Of course your players might be a little more grown up than that, but compare and contrast this technique with the previous one.<br/><br/>TAKE THEIR CHARACTER SHEET AWAY<br/>This is seriously the most desperate. If a player consistently breaks out of their straightjacket, tell them that they have a perfect right to do that, but that their character is in danger of becoming irrelevant to the plot. Maybe they should think about creating a new character that would fit better in with rest of the group. Do the best you can to make out that your hand was forced on the issue. If you are enough of a bastard you might want to try and marginalise them socially as well, until they knuckle under or agree to create a more compliant alter ego.<br/><br/><br/>DISCLAIMER<br/>I am very disorganised, and don't know how to prepare sufficiently that railroading could ever be my thing. In fact I positively exude unreliability and very rarely run games at all. However if I did I expect I would do it as described.<br/><br/>(Andy Morris, UK edition)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330126/#Comment_330126" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T19:46:03+00:00" title="June 15, 2011  7:46PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When you <b>railroad the shit out of your players,</b> roll+cool.

In this context, you do have such a thing as a bad choice.

When the dice come up bad it's luck, when a rule says you can't it's a system you've bought in to, when the GM tells you no it's arbitrary.<br/><br/>Three similar examples: If I want magic flight powers but the game says I can't because we're playing Dogs, I suck it up and not fly.  If I'm playing something where I can fly but I have to succeed in a roll to pull it off and the dice come up bad, I suck it up because sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.  If I'm playing a game where I have always-on flight powers but the GM doesn't want me leaving a place so he declares my flight power unusable, I've just been screwed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14482/railroading-techniques" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14482/railroading-techniques" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14482/railroading-techniques/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F14482%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F14482%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
