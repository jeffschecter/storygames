I have no patience or tolerance for oWoD system any more.  I can barely tolerate the nWoD system.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite>Would you hack it and if so what hacks would you give it? Or would you retool some other system for it?</blockquote>I'm not sure.  I believe I claimed my first love was <i>Werewolf: the Apocalypse</i> so this is tricky... because I don't even really have a desire to play in that world any more.  I loved it then, but it just doesn't turn me on like it used to.<br/><br/>If I WAS going to try to play with it, though... I might attempt to use the nWoD system for it, but it seems like doing so might require (or at least feel like it requires) really extensive fiddling with mechanics, and that doesn't sound like fun (though there was a thread on rpg.net once about someone using the Keys and Manifestations from Geist as Werewolf: the Forsaken powers.  So I guess I might try something like that, possibly.)<br/><br/>Otherwise, I'd probably attempt an Apocalypse World hack.  But that's just because I'm so very enamored with Apocalypse World right now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294978/#Comment_294978" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T12:30:53+00:00" title="September 28, 2010 12:30PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite> Confessionals would be turned into "Word on the Street" where some random joe says something rumor he heard about the runners or the run they're on.</blockquote>\nWhat?  Nonsense.  Confessionals should stay as-is, because nothing fits the cyberpunk theme better than reality TV.  Seriously, the conflict between the "reality" and the manufactured storyline and similar issues are totally cyberpunk.  Make it a game about a reality show about some Shadowrunners, take some cues from Max Headroom and go to town.

Too goofy.<br/><br/>One of the things I liked in 2nd ed (not sure if it made it to later editions) was the reputation system and who has and hasn't heard about you.

I would probably make it a very human-centric Planescape too, not just for ease of hacking but it would limit the magic down to just Faith and Sorcery, which really fit well. Maybe give each plane or location its own Belief that anyone could follow as if it was one of their own for artha and traits.<br/><br/>Conversely FATE/DF would be a real simple hack, drop the Trouble Aspect and replace it with a Belief Aspect, tinker a few stunts and powers and blammo a nice action packed adventure version of Planescape. I think it would also feel very close to what the game was back in the day, and less of its own thing like BW would.<br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295008/#Comment_295008" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-28T13:56:58+00:00" title="September 28, 2010  1:56PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I said <b>D&amp;D Red Box</b> ('83 Mentzer edition).

I'd be willing to play T5, but I'd want to hack it a bit.<br/><br/>My longest love affair (before fudge/fate) was HERO system, used for the bulk of a 10 year scifi campaign. No, I wouldn't use that system again - as a GM, I remember spending way too much time designing gadgets, technology, psychic powers, aliens, etc., which I'd want to do in much more streamlined/less crunchy fashion these days.

I keep it on the shelf and am more than willing to run it from time to time, although with all the games I have to playtest, its a lot less likely these days. Simple focused gameplay, with more than a  few strange rules elements. Yet I still love it. Nostalgia, simplicity, and years of fun all together make it a still loved thing. <br/><br/>Given a choice of D&amp;D editions, it would be my preference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295421/#Comment_295421" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-30T16:17:40+00:00" title="September 30, 2010  4:17PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Epidiah Ravachol</cite>I'd certainly play it now.

I have this fantasy of pitching an idea to Atlas Games to write a volume devoted to Troupe Style play. It influenced most of my gaming experience and all that I think about games. Too little has been done with the ideas they pioneered there! <br/><br/>Oddly enough though, I've only ever played hacks of it. The first campaign I was in my GM worked on an amalgam of GURPs for general play with the AM magic system. And of course, this was with my freeformer friends so I think we rarely used those rules anyway. <br/><br/>What I'd really love is to be able to write up how we actually played--both that original group, and later with Vincent &amp; Meg--and go from there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin" title="Chris_Goodwin"><img alt="Chris_Goodwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/104/nWRZN6AU4P4W8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin">Chris_Goodwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295763/#Comment_295763" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-03T14:48:43+00:00" title="October  3, 2010  2:48PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My first love was Champions 3rd edition (or, technically, the Hero System)...
