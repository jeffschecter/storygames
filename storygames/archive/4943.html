Suggestions around mechanizing or randomizing adversity sound interesting. Does anyone use this in their play right now. It sounds kind of like how the situation is set up using cards in In a Wicked Age.<br/><br/>That solo InSpectres play is cool. That's kind of along the lines I was thinking. Thanks for posting it.<br/><br/>One idea I had is putting a character in a terrible situation where the odds are stacked against them, then giving them resources to work their way out of it through storytelling. Once the character manages to work itself into a position of advantage, you stop playing them and take on the role of someone they've gained the advantage over. There was an Avalon Hill game that worked this way back in the day, though I can no longer remember what it was called.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111084/#Comment_111084" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-02T05:00:47+00:00" title="December  2, 2007  5:00AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That looks really cool!

Making reign characters using the one-roll system falls into this category. Character generation gives you a bunch of lifepaths your character has lived, but doesn't tell you what order they occurred in. You tell the story out of the pieces provided.<br/><br/><b>Puzzle Play</b>: How do I assemble this set of resources in such a way as to achieve a goal? The only example I can think of here is the experience of trying to make a Burning Empires character with as high a propaganda skill as possible while passing though the lifepath "beggar".<br/><br/><b>Interpretive Play</b>: How do I interpret this set of elements? The In a Wicked Age oracle is an example of this. I've got a few narrative nuggets and I have to decide what in those nuggets corresponds to plot elements and characters in such a way that I end up a strong set of crossed interests for conflict fodder. Maybe Hikikomori falls into this category too. Something happens mechanically, but it's up to me to decide how that becomes a narrative.<br/><br/>Most of these are essentially mini-games within Story Gaming. I think this is a starting point for solo play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111678/#Comment_111678" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-04T13:12:14+00:00" title="December  4, 2007  1:12PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been "playing" with Tarot cards occasionally as a way to emulate what I get out of RPGs as opposed to simple solo make believe.
