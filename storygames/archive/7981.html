It turned out to be sort-of-fun playing without a character - but this time, I played a character, and it was really fun.<br/><br/>This time I played a character called Niho. She's a chubby peasant girl with the Buddha nature. I was kind of worried at first - usually, playing a static and harmonious character is the best way to get boring or stilted play. ("What do you do?" "I do nothing, I'm perfectly content with everything!!" "Uh... okay.") However, in Archipelago, it worked wonderfully. <br/><br/>Each session begins with players suggesting destiny points for each other. These are specific key events that you (and the other players) will guide your character's story towards. So I had a choice of five destiny points. I can't remember all of them - but the one I picked was "She gets hold of the monkey king's necklace, which controls his mind". <br/><br/>So how was my character supposed to actually make this happen? Well, first of all, it wasn't up to her. This was a destiny point - she could do whatever she wanted, but events would conspire so that the necklace came into her possession. Second, it wasn't all up to me either - all players are responsible for pushing towards the destiny point! (We write down each others' destiny points on a sheet, so we always know what to push for in each others' stories).<br/><br/>So it went a little like this:<br/><br/>Me: "Niho walks into the monkey king's palace. She carries two bags of flour on a stick over her shoulders. She puts them down, sits in the shade, wipes the sweat off her forehead and drinks some water." (Pull. I'm at the place, but I'm not doing anything.)<br/>Player X: "The monkey king is having a bath in the courtyard. Next to him, Niho sees his clothes - and his necklace, glinting in the sun." (Pull from another player. Here it is, do you want it?)<br/>Me: "Niho drinks more water." (This is me showing my character - how Niho seriously <i>doesn't</i> just go for action at the first opportunity.)<br/>Player Y: "The monkey king calls out to Niho. 'Hey! You! Come here!'" (Actively pushing Niho a little closer to the destiny point...)<br/><br/>So it went, back and forth, with the other players making sure Niho ended up where she had to: In control of the necklace. I was playing my character to the hilt (as they say), and it was fun for everyone involved! <br/><br/>I have to say, even though it's bad form to brag about your own designs, this one really does what I want it to. I'm having a lot of fun playing my own game, and am really looking forward to the next session.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/willem" title="willem"><img alt="willem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/willem">willem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176411/#Comment_176411" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-27T10:19:52+00:00" title="October 27, 2008 10:19AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Could you articulate more the thing that it  does, that you wanted it to? I've played Archipelago too, and enjoyed it. I did notice that we didn't push for Destiny points as much as it sounds your group did. I wonder if I had accented the need to do that, we would have had an even better experience (or one more in line with the designer's intention)...?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176508/#Comment_176508" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-28T00:46:35+00:00" title="October 28, 2008 12:46AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess what I'm talking about is this:<br/><br/>The game provides a very concrete focus for each character's story, one that the whole group creates and is made explicitly aware of. The game also places the responsibility for keeping that focus on everybody. When you're playing out your story, I and everyone else around the table have a GM-like responsibility for getting you to your destiny point. You can play hard, or lean back; you can rail against your destiny, or go after it like a hungry dog; but we're all going to make sure you reach that point no matter what.<br/><br/>Destiny points are central; they're the most important of all game mechanics in Archipelago.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
