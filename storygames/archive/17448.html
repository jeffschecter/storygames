The Dealer and other players may participate in narrating the scene, perhaps also spending chips to recover Harm for characters they control</i>",<br/>but it doesn't actually say anything about Dealer-initiated Recovery scenes.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, NPCs are mostly treated as full-fledged PCs in the rules, but I'm not sure it would be OK to "steal" the spotlight from PCs to recover Harm.<br/>What are your thoughts on that?<br/><br/>Thanks.<br/>Girolamo                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
