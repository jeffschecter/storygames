You could also have some maneuver available. Stuff like 'diving into cover', 'making a hard right' etc. If you succeed at those meneuvers, you get a big advantage, or perhaps go into 'sneaky mode', where the pursuers are still combing the area but aren't exactly sure where you are (again, taking a cue from the above suggestion). If you fail, however, the pursuers get dangerously close.<br/>\nIf you're in a chase, you'd need some special meneuver to get into sneaky mode, carrying with it a risk of losing valuable distance. Perhaps you can't attempt those maneuvers unless you're at some distance from the pursuers. And when you're in sneaky mode, maybe you'd need to successfully make some consecutive hiding rolls for it to be over.<br/>\nMaybe if you fail your hiding roll by a little, one guy notices you - and you can try to, I don't know, shoot him dead before he manages to alert his buddies.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the track, you could also have two markers for the pursuers. The first marker represents just the fastest and smartest fellows - if they catch up with you or find you, you can still fight them, and if you kill them quickly enough you can continue running away. The second marker represents everybody else - if that catches up with you, you're surrounded by a horde of people, and you're screwed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328421/#Comment_328421" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-08T06:20:16+00:00" title="June  8, 2011  6:20AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We really liked the Chase Sub-system in Empire of Dust.

So in effect you arent treating chasing as different from any other dramatic situation.  That is - complications, decisions and consequences.  If there are no complications or decisions, then the fastest party always wins.  As a rule of thumb, I think its best to concentrate on the slowest party - they are the ones that should have to decide to escalate if they want to stay in the race.<br/><br/>i.e. "<i>Their legs/car/horse is faster than yours -- they are catching up/getting away ... what do you do!!!!?</i>"<br/><br/>I think it also depends on who is chasing who, you might ant to handle it differently.  I mean, if the PCs are chasing an NPC, its <i>usually </i>going to advance the story if they catch him, but if they dont, its been much to do about nothing.  whereas if the NPCs are chasing the PCs, it could be interesting either way.  Generalisations of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328668/#Comment_328668" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-08T20:24:26+00:00" title="June  8, 2011  8:24PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>.

I love the phrase: "moments the chasee create and the chaser respond to" Makes it very clear!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlexMayo" title="AlexMayo"><img alt="AlexMayo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlexMayo">AlexMayo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329325/#Comment_329325" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-13T04:44:21+00:00" title="June 13, 2011  4:44AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            'Old Timey Crowd'?

It's a bidding system, where each of the parties ratchets up the difficulty of the maneuvers. James Bond 007's core mechanic is the Ease Factor, which determines how difficult a roll will be - chases involve each side bidding for ease factors, which decrease with each successive bid (kind of like Name That Tune). Once a side is no longer willing to push the ease factor lower, the winning side determines who goes first and both sides use the lowest bid ease factor.<br/><br/>It's a remarkable system which perfectly captures the tension and fun of cinematic chases.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329618/#Comment_329618" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T09:53:14+00:00" title="June 14, 2011  9:53AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For a d20 experimental game I ran years ago I cam up with one I really liked, but will likely need tweak for whatever system you may be using. But overall it works well and is easily adaptable to most games. <br/><br/>Dudes in the chases have some sort of skill in it right? Ok that is how many d10's he will get. You can get extras for narration, car, help, etc. Roll those, they are now your pool. <br/><br/>Take a deck of cards as is. Shuffle count off at least a number of cards equal to the characters skill rating. Modify as you see fit, but the number of cards presents the difficulty of the chase. <br/><br/>You a come upon a turn, and ( draw a card, the value on the card is the number that they have to come up with out of their pool to keep up). The face cards create some sort of random effect. The chases is lost once they have lost by a certain amount, the chase is won if they make it through the deck.<br/><br/>Face Card Effect Ideas<br/>Jack - Combat action (dude in the car pulls a gun on you)<br/>Queen - Did you lose him? ( something happens and you think you might have lost him, draw one card from the chase deck and one extra from the unused deck, take the higher of the two)<br/>King - Blow a tire (GM rolls a die, if there is a die of that value in the pool it is removed)<br/><br/>Modifiers<br/>Wide Open streets ie desert (can fail by up to 10 before failure)<br/>Rural streets (can fail up to 5 before failure)[Failure amount also represents damage that your vehicle may take]<br/>Head Start advantage (sometimes you know he is going to run, adjust the deck as you see fit to reflect any advantages you may see)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
