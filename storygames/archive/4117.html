Holy cow! I can not believe that this piece of story game dynamite has been sitting on my bookshelf for one and a half year without seeing any play-time. What a waste!<br/><br/>Anyway: We got discussing the distribution of the different guides around the table. Someone noted that I will always be the Mistake to the same player that is the Mistake to me, and prophesized that this might grow boring, since it will only ever be me against this guy. He suggested that one might place the Mistake on the left or right of the Heart and move the corresponding moon to the opposite position.<br/><br/>I'm posing this question directly to Mr. Lehman: Is there any particular consideration behind the decision to place the Mistake opposite the Heart, except for the obvious symbolic value? <br/><br/>I'm posing this question to allay'all: Has anyone attempted to play with the Mistake moved to the side? Is there a considerable difference? <br/><br/>/Kalle                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Faerieloch" title="Faerieloch"><img alt="Faerieloch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Faerieloch">Faerieloch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92359/#Comment_92359" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T17:54:59+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  5:54PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have never tried to move the role of the Mistaken around.

I'll keep that in mind.  It's at the top of my list of games to play SOON along with the Roach and the Mountain Witch (the other two games I picked up at last years Gen Con) so maybe I will just try it with 3 if I can't make four happen.  Someone else told me I should definitely have 4 people.  Maybe Jason Morningstar?  I don't remember.  I guess I now have it on good authority that both of those numbers work well, so I'll not worry so much about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
