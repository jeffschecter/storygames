Does anyone here have any experience with a Living Campaign?<br/><br/><span style="color: #339900;">Living Greyhawk (2000\u20132008) A D&amp;D campaign set in the original Dungeons and Dragons world of Greyhawk, this campaign was introduced at Gen Con 2000 in conjunction with the release of the third edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.[1] The real world was divided into 30 administrative regions, each one keyed to a specific region of the Greyhawk world (that is, France = Ekbir, Switzerland = Dullstrand, Australia = Perrenland, etc). Players could either play "Core " adventures that were available to all players worldwide or adventures that had been specifically created for their home region, but they could not play adventures written for other regions. (In order to play adventures from another Greyhawk region, the player was required to physically travel to the real-world area associated with that region.) The campaign was less popular than Living City, but still had over 15,000 players and over 1,000 adventures,[3] but with the advent of Fourth Edition rules, the campaign was drawn to a close in 2008 and replaced with the Living Forgotten Realms campaign.<br/></span><br/><br/><br/>Also: <a href="http://hobbes.viceandvillainy.org:4242/LivingDivine/" rel="nofollow">Living Divine Campaign</a><br/>And <a href="http://livingforgottenrealms.com/" rel="nofollow">Living forgottern realms</a>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353755/#Comment_353755" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-10T13:17:38+00:00" title="January 10, 2012  1:17PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 10, 2012 1:19PM by ChristopherWeeks.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is surely someone more expert than I around here, but I played Living Greyhawk through maybe eight or ten mods before deciding it wasn't really my thing.

You make a character using the universal guidelines, and you can play in any Living game that is playing an adventure your character hasn't already played. When you play an adventure, you get some reward at the end that will help you in later adventures in the same series. You can either play through the adventures that everybody has access to, or you can play adventures set in your particular region. If I remember correctly, there's not much in the way of adventures for Vancouver (Canada), but there's lots for the US just south of the border. The adventures all come from WotC, but there's guidelines for writing your own. I played one of those, the DM wrote it himself, and it was just as good or better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353767/#Comment_353767" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-10T14:05:35+00:00" title="January 10, 2012  2:05PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know how RPGA managed the overall campaign, but the regions were autonomously controled.

Anyone who passed a test could run LG games (I think) and organize LG events, but had to do it through their online system.  Each player gets a certificate for each mod they run through and the results of the game were returned to the RPGA.

If you kill Ivan, you get no rewards, but if you defeat the monsters you still get xp. If you rescue Ivan, you get a reward that says Ivan owes you a favour. If you let the bugbears take Ivan, you get a reward called Bugbear Favour. You can't get both rewards.<br/><br/>Then when you play the sequel, <i>Ivan's Revenge</i> (IA2), different things happen based on what reward you got. So if Ivan owes you a favour, you show the DM your card and the DM says that Ivan tells you the red dragon's weakness so you can kill it easier. If you have the bugbear favour, three bugbears will fight the minotaur by your side. You can't get both rewards -- except if one PC played <i>Ivan's Childhood</i> and saved Ivan, and another PC played Ivan's Childhood at some other time, some other session, and his party gave Ivan to the bugbears.<br/><br/>Either way, you still have to fight the minotaur and the red dragon. And occasionally, the adventure will put the NPC in danger, which I thought was funny because in a real campaign I'd actually care about him, but in this sort of game, the NPCs really mean nothing.

We come up with a way to get around some obstacles (read: battles) through roleplaying. The DM still "makes shit happen" so that we have to do the fights anyway. Because unless you overcome the enemy in battle, you don't get XP (or at least not nearly as much XP). In the end, it's all about the XP. The battle occurs, desire dies a little inside.<br/><br/>And more often than not, in those games where the DM is decent or totally friggin awesome, we would have me and 4-5 other strangers having an awesome time, using roleplaying to have fun, overcome obstacles, have a grand old time. And then at least 1-2 big fights come up, where we know that we could continue to roleplay our way out of these encounters... but the players and DM all look at each other, sort of nod our heads slowly, and roleplay finding our way into at least the Big Battle anyway. Because again killing enemies in combat == more XP. In the end, it's all about the XP. The battle occurs, desire dies a little inside.<br/><br/>That's historically the thing. I dunno what it's been like since maybe 3.0/3.5.<br/><br/>I do know that Derek Guder wrote or architected out some of the rules for Living Dark Sun. And in it, he expressly combatted this very problem with a simple and breathtakingly blunt rules hack: There is no XP. If you participate in the scenario, it doesn't matter if you use combat, roleplay (talking, sneaky plans, etc) to overcome obstacles: If you make it to the end of the scenario, then every character gains a level. That's it. So it doesn't matter if you and your friends are having a fun-as-hell time getting into the skin of your character, if the game feels more natural to avoid some or many (or all!) of the plotted-out combats, and you do so creatively (and likely with skill checks etc), then congrats, "You have completed the scenario. Level up!"<br/><br/>Here's what I think about Derek's Living Dark Sun leveling rule: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnAYgNnA5A0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnAYgNnA5A0</a><br/><br/>(although, I have not seen it in play myself, and have not attended a 4e Dark Sun living game, so I cannot speak firsthand on it)<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353814/#Comment_353814" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-10T17:50:16+00:00" title="January 10, 2012  5:50PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When 3e came out I played in Living Greyhawk.

(Over 100 games in 2010, for various and sundry reasons.) I can probably answer most questions about LFR. I have less experience with LG.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite><br/>I don't think play influences the adventures that get written.</blockquote>\nMostly true, yeah. For some LFR modules, there were surveys at the end of the module to collect results, and based on the first month or so of play the global admins would make decisions about what actually happened in the world. This was communicated fairly poorly, so players of the campaign didn't really tend to feel like they were having an effect. There's one blog post about this <a href="http://community.wizards.com/lfr/blog/2010/08/30/critical_events" rel="nofollow">here.</a><br/><br/>I too have heard that LG was better about this. LG pushed much more authority down into the hands of the regional admins; they also had smaller regions than LFR. This tended to make the campaign feel more cohesive.<br/><br/>Right, so regions. LG had this system where your characters only had so many time units per year, and it cost time units to play in a module. You the player were not allowed to repeat modules. It was cheaper to play modules in you the player's geographic region, to simulate the time taken by travel. Also, you generally had to physically travel to another region to play modules from that region.<br/><br/>This made regions super-important. Also, admins for a region had the right to make rulings about players, tell you that your character had become unplayable because they'd turned evil, and so on. It also had the effect of limiting the rate at which players could consume content -- turns out that when you don't have those governors, someone obsessive will consume all the available modules very quickly and then complain about the lack of new material.<br/><br/>LFR also had regions, but they were purely cosmetic. They've gotten rid of them as of the third year of the campaign. <br/><br/>Level bumps: not popular with some people, but a good idea. LFR doesn't use them. Ashes of Athas, which is the quasi-official 4e Dark Sun Living Campaign, does.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353882/#Comment_353882" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-11T07:35:37+00:00" title="January 11, 2012  7:35AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Oh my, Jon, are we talking about living<i>indie</i>campaigns?</blockquote>\nYeah, in these particular cases, I think we're mostly talking about designing indie games so that the "living" part is built into the game.  So, like, in order to play you have to go online and find a record of somebody else's game, build on it through play, and then post the results online to share with others.  Or you bring the living parts with you to the table when you bring your character or other materials to a meetup, and the group looks at what everybody brings and concocts a new adventure from there.

I joined the campaign mid-way through it's first year, so most of that is on the guys who originally set it up: Teos Abadia, Chad Brown, Chris Sims, David Christ.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe original model was "play 3 modules, level up." Since we had 3 mods per chapter and one new chapter at each big convention, that basically boiled down to "gain a level for each big chunk of story/convention you go to."<br/>\n<br/>\nThat worked pretty well at first, but as the campaign went on, we had more disparity in levels between people who had played everything and people who simply didn't. So for the next several chapters, we're going to a model that's simply "This chapter is at level X - whether you played everything else or not, come to the table at level X."<br/>\n<br/>\nIt does take a bit of the "I earned my levels" away from the game and there's some concern that people will just skip over stuff, but ultimately we're trying to make an interesting story here, so the most important reward for playing should be the playing itself, not the levels or treasure or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm very much an organized play/living campaign outsider. I've done a wee bit of Living Forgotten Realms, but the complete lack of an over-arching story didn't really interest me, and I did it more to social with folks who were into it. Which is why I usually preferred running the adventures to playing them. So it's been a very interesting journey getting involved in an OP campaign that shared some of the strengths of those programs but only had a single, unified storyline.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm obviously biased, but I think it's a really cool thing, and I definitely encourage people to check it out, think about it, and experiment with the basic idea in other forms. There is something really cool about having lots of people all play the same adventure and compare notes with how they got through stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd on the general topic of XP, anecdotally I know lots of folks who have basically brushed it aside in D&amp;D. One of the most enjoyable D&amp;D games I played in was run by Greg Bilsland and we basically fast-tracked leveling to a crazy degree. Basically, we'd have big marathon 8-hour gaming sessions and the plot would move us to a new important location once every 1-2 sessions - at which point we'd level up. It did mean that some things (like my attempt at alchemy) were pretty much ruined, but it also meant that since we knew we'd level when we advanced the story, we focused on that entirely.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were a number of fights that I remember we skipped entirely or backed away from because we knew that we didn't have to slog it out, and there wasn't any reason for our characters to jump into the fray.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of games have tried to get around that by saying stuff like "You get XP by getting around a problem, whether you killed the monsters or not" but I'm not sure if that's a forceful enough statement. Flat-out coming out and saying "XP has no connection to the individual fights, it's just linked to the overall story" really shifts your focus there.<br/>\n<br/>\nDefinitely won't work in all groups or for all D&amp;D games, but I think it's an interesting and important thing to notice: in any game, players will tend to focus on whatever mechanism you create to provide them with rewards.<br/>\n<br/>\nGive them more power for fighting things? They're going to fight things. Give them more for continuing the story? That's what they'll do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sliberty" title="Sliberty"><img alt="Sliberty" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sliberty">Sliberty</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353973/#Comment_353973" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-11T14:14:59+00:00" title="January 11, 2012  2:14PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The idea of a massive non-online multiplayer game sounds good in theory, but in practice, I think it has to be disappointing. The draw, for me, would be having my character's actions affect other players' campaigns. If the actions of your party don't affect what happens in your neighbor party's campaigns, then what's the point of playing in the same "living" setting? Just play by yourself and post the results to story games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353982/#Comment_353982" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-11T14:58:09+00:00" title="January 11, 2012  2:58PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 11, 2012 3:27PM by ivan.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you guys had a look at Caravan?

It's _complementary_ to the usual "play with your buddies" kind of game.

You pretty much play your character locally in games the GM creates, maybe you visit other cities nearby playing the same character, which can be fairly cool. But you can only really interact with the "major plots" at the big conventions (with the exception of maybe one random person every now and then who gets lucky). There is a certain amount of networking that goes on for people who have the time to send craploads of e-mails and the resources to travel, such that their characters become well-known, but that's basically as tied-together as it typically gets.<br/><br/>Now, what I'd REALLY like to see is a Living InSpectres campaign... <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354191/#Comment_354191" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-13T15:46:28+00:00" title="January 13, 2012  3:46PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Please note, the <a href="http://swingpad.com/dustyboots/wordpress/?p=296" rel="nofollow">Mud Dragon</a> characters you create and play are legal at any and all Living Mud Dragon tables.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
