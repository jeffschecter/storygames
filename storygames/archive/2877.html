But sadly, poor boris is gone and we're left with our yankee blue jeans and story games board. So here goes<br/><br/>This is a thread about taking a game and talking about what we think is wrong with it, publicly. I think that casting it into an open light, in open discussion is a big part of this communities spirit, and will all help us be more critical of our own work, and make us better critics of the work of others. We're going to play nice, but we aren't going to hold back. We're going to back up things we think don't work with examples of why we don't think they work. We're going to only talk about games that are at the ashcan level of production and up; that is, you can get your hands on a publicly released version, that is currently for sale in some form (even if its only a buck, even if there is an upgraded version on its way). I would like to focus on games that are "done." At least in as far as the designer has published a finished product, and any revisions or alteration to the text would exist as errata and/or a revised edition. <br/><br/>Maybe this will work, maybe it won't. Maybe the rules i'm setting up here aren't good (i hope they are) Lets just start talking and see what it gets us. Here are some ground rules:<br/><br/>If you are the author:<br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2This is good, you need this.<br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2That said, this might sting, don't take it personal, everyone wants to help make your game more better.<br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2You can site from the text and say, "well the rules do address the problem you're having here on pgs XXX, maybe you missed it, maybe that should be clearer." Thats cool, feel free to do that. <br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2You can't defend your work with "you don't get it!" or "thats not what i meant" If we don't get it, then you didn't say it right. <br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2THE CRITIQUERS ARE ALWAYS RIGHT<br/><br/>If you are critiquing:<br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2You don't get to make opinion statements, you can only talk about things that don't make sense, or you didn't understand, or when you played the game didn't work for you. <br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2Don't worry about hurting someones feelings, don't try to hurt someones feelings.<br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2You job is pointing out problems, explaining why they are problems, and (if you can) offering some advice. <br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2I'm going to say go ahead and critique things like layout, type treatment and physical design, because that is something i personally have a big interest in. Remember that you've got to be specific, and no opinions.<br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2If you think a game really had NO mistakes, problems, critiques thats fine. If you want to say so, whisper it to the author only, that won't help the thread keep momentum.<br/><br/>You have to volunteer your product for this kind of treatment. No one can say "hey, lets tear the shit out of Cold City!" (I just kind of picked Cold City at random, hope you don't mind Malc). Thats not kosher.<br/><br/>That being said, i'll volunteer my own game "Primitive" for the cutting apart.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65225/#Comment_65225" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-25T06:42:25+00:00" title="April 25, 2007  6:42AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2007 6:43AM by Eric Provost.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dig that you're trying to set some comfortable critiquing guidelines, but I think you're pulling the punches too much.  Pulling them back into that less-productive way.  I have two very specific issues with your proposed rules.<br/><br/>1.  Permission?  If someone feels that they need permission to speak their mind from the game's designer, then I think they're already in the too polite brainspace.  Andy just recently created a new category for threads; "The Game Report".  I think that everyone here should use that space to clearly speak their mind on any game play experience they've had.  Especially the bad stuff.  Without permsission from the designer.<br/><br/>2.  No opinion statements?  Seriously?  If I just don't like how something works, then how is that opinion not helpful to the designer?  <br/><br/>I'd like to suggest one big solid golden rule;<br/><br/><b>Attack the design, spare the designer.</b><br/><br/>In other words, I think saying things like; "I think the Wibbly-Tree Mechanism of this game sucks ass!" is totally cool, but saying "Why the fuck did you put a Wibbly-Tree Mechanism in this game??" is totally not.  We can be harsh on each others' games without being harsh on each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig" title="Malcolm Craig"><img alt="Malcolm Craig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/contestedground/UntitledAlbum/photo?authkey=UQZ1oivg8Lc#5239981636020065186"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig">Malcolm Craig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65230/#Comment_65230" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-25T06:53:31+00:00" title="April 25, 2007  6:53AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2007 8:10AM by Malcolm Craig.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kevin Allen Jr</cite>You have to volunteer your product for this kind of treatment.

Let me explain my thinking on this a little.<br/><br/>1. Of course no one needs your permission to crit your game, we all could go and whip up 100 thread about how we feel about peoples games. The "permission" you describe is more of a "hey, i'de like you guys who are interested to talk about my stuff." That way the author has an understanding that such a thing is happening and they can activly participate. I'm not saying don't critique what you want, i'm just trying to keep things a little organized.<br/><br/>2. I don't like dragons. I think their lame. They always have the same kind of tropes attached and i'm supposed to be all in awe everytime one appears, bullshit. I don't buy it. I don't want it. Now lets say your game is all about dragons. How does this help? it doesn't, i'm just not interested in your game, and thats fine. It doesn't mean that dragons are lame empirically, just that i'm not down with it. I want critiques of hard and fast and PROVEN things. <br/><br/>3. Attack the Design, spare the designer is a really eloquent way of saying a lot of what i was trying to get across. Excellent.

I think Ron's "don't criticise a game you're not interested in" is also a good rule of thumb.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65283/#Comment_65283" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-25T09:01:05+00:00" title="April 25, 2007  9:01AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            all this stuff sounds good.

Ane yet I, and I think a lot of other people, never get around to offering what they know becuase they feel a little uneasy about critiquing to someone they might not even have met.<br/><br/>So I hearby request permission to critique The Shadow of Yesterday, not because I think it's bad, but because it's my freaking favorite game right now and I have some strong opinions on it.<br/><br/>I'd also probably be able to offer something half useful on Contender and Burning Empires.<br/><br/>And if someone's requesting to critique your game, and you don't want a public discussion?

I will update it if/when more are shared with me.<br/><br/>1. The stacking of traits and resources could be clearer. The information is in the text and example, but not easily accessible enough for every reader.  <br/><br/>2. More examples in the text, in addition to the ones present and the long one at the end, could help with point No. 1. specifically and maybe in general as well. <br/><br/>3. It might need some advice for easing players into its hardcore Gamist style if they haven't played that way before.<br/><br/>4. Some readers' comprehension would be helped if the actions in Conflict Resolution were listed in a step-by-step process sort of way, like a numbered list or a flow chart.<br/><br/>And that's it so far.  Any further critique is appreciated and will be added here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68084/#Comment_68084" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T14:45:04+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  2:45PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christian, <br/><br/>I don't think anything else came up in my game that caused trouble. 2-4 would all have helped. <br/><br/>I'd like the flowchart/list version of conflict resolution as a one-page reference sheet, by preference, so you can refer to any of the relevant rules as you play. In fact, I created these for my game - one for the hunter, one for the challenger - and they were quite useful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
