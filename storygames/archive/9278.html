If you say "Everything", you lose. <br/>Also, feel free to chime in on other's choices. Keep it friendly!<br/><br/>For me, it's hard. I can pretty much be sold on playing or running any game given enough interest.<br/><br/>I'd say:<br/><br/>Fastlane: The game does something I want to play (a screwed up, fast-paced wild drama with lots of action and crazy twists), but:<br/>* the roulette handling, too slow. This can be resolved with dice, so not so much an issue.<br/>* last time I read through it, there was just too much in play. It felt like I had to learn a very complicated system from the ground up, for the sole purpose of playing one kind of game (which I could run with other rules with a few tweaks and solid direction). The "learning investment to gaming payoff" ratio was low IMO (but feel free to school me with your own experiences).<br/><br/>Fading Suns: It's faux-Dune, to be sure. And I love the setting, and can for the most part tolerate most of the rules. I can't stand the alien races, though. The game totally does not need "cool aliens that can hold 4 swords at once" or "elves, but really good in combat!", they feel like they were tacked on into what could have been an otherwise hot-as-hell SF drama game.<br/><br/>EDIT, thought of one more:<br/>Legend of the Five Rings (L5R): I dig the setting even in all its faux-Japan wackiness. The system is mostly OK, I love how the stats are set (each of five elements, and each element represents a physical and mental/social attribute at the same time, they are linked). I can't dig combat in the system anymore. There have been advances in the system (and sword styles) in the last few editions, but basically the system comes down to standing toe to toe with an enemy, and rolling handfuls of dice, looking for 10s, until one of you falls. It's really no more strategic or complicated than that. I think the system deserves a ground-up redesign of the combat system, one that is still pretty simple while offering some strategic options.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205354/#Comment_205354" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-05T10:06:50+00:00" title="May  5, 2009 10:06AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Exalted</b> is probably going to get mentioned a lot. I really, really like the game's original premise. The anime stylings were a little grating early on because it didn't fit with what I wanted out of the game: Epic, biblical, ancient and exotic. Second Ed came along and made everything even more mechanically crunchy and more removed from the swords-and-sandals vibe I was trying to dig out from under the setting, and it all just became too much to bear. There's a lot to love with what they're doing with it, though. It's just not for me any more.<br/><br/><b>Reign</b>. ORE is fun. I like dice games. The setting is wacky as hell but I can get behind it. Characters are interesting and fun, combat is fun, mechanically it's a blast. I even like the sorta-kinda-new-skool Passions. But there are two major things and a host of niggling little things that keep me from really, really loving it:<br/><br/>* It's a very magical setting but the magic is so tightly wed to the setting that it's hard to just quickly shop it and be done. I don't have the same complaint about BW's Magic Burner, so I'm not really sure where the line is. Some of it is the fact that much/most of the magic is spread amongst a dozen PDFs. Another is that it's procedurally tricky to build a magic-using character unless your magic school is the very first thing you pick, and you build your character toward competency (since competency in much of Reign's magic has unexpected dependencies).<br/><br/>* The Company rules don't really work. The reasons they work are worth their own thread and have been hashed out pretty thoroughly elsewhere, but after messing with them I came to really appreciate the Infection Phase rules from Burning Empires a whole lot more. It's disappointing because the Company rules are supposed to be Reign's killer app.<br/><br/>Just my last couple "almost loved it" experiences.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205355/#Comment_205355" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-05T10:07:43+00:00" title="May  5, 2009 10:07AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love <a href="http://www.dragonslayergames.com/games/" rel="nofollow">EPICS</a>.

But for me...I'm not into that whole Were- vibe.  I don't really like werewolf movies.  The whole "dude lives among us until by the light of the full moon he transforms and goes on a killer rampage" schtick never held much interest for me (probably for the same reasons that I never found The Hulk to be all that interesting of a Marvel Hero).

I love the gritty fictional take on a war that is too often sugar coated, I love the power creation system that lets you make ANYTHING you can imagine, and I love the short pieces of fiction that really set the mood,<br>\n<br>\nWhat ruined it for me, after several play sessions, was the system.  I'm not a big min/maxer, but even I can see that the Brick or the Agility guy always, always wins, because the system combines damage and initiative into the same element of the roll.  Not to mention, as the GM I need approximately 10*N (N&gt;3) D10s to roll for the NPCs in each conflict, because each roll has to happen simultaneously for initiative purposes.  Combat is very slow and clunky because of that, unless someone has the "Kill everything in one roll" power known as Hard dice. <br>\n<br>\nI understand that there were some tweaks done to the system in later iterations that fixed some of those issues.  Is Wild Talents any better?

Giant robots plus HP Lovecraft? Right on! Nice art, too. Sadly, it doesn't deliver. The flavor text is all way too specific - instead of giving you a starting point to create your own stuff, it's more canonical, straightjacket stuff. The kind where you have to read tons and tons of stuff before you can start.<br/><br/>And the system is thoroughly uninspiring. One thing they got right is to measure in-game time in scenes, instead of hours and days. But the pretentious sidebar about advancing the evolution of roleplaying games by calling the GM a Storyguide is a crowning "I don't know whether to laugh or cry" moment.<br/><br/>Still, there IS that premise. Piloting a giant robot... and going insane. Cultists really do manage to destroy civilization. Mmmmmm. Right now, I'm thinking I can cobble together enough stuff from Burning Empires and Mouse Guard to make Burning CthulhuTech work nice, if I can get people to play with me...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205448/#Comment_205448" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-05T15:39:23+00:00" title="May  5, 2009  3:39PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2009 3:39PM by Johnstone.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, Vampire.<br/><br/>Vampire has two dealbreakers. Three dealbreakers. Okay, maybe four.<br/><br/>First, starting off as a 1st Level DnD character is not my natural inclination when I think of playing immortal bloodsuckers with supernatural powers, but then again, I'm not Mark ReindotHagen, either. But whatever.<br/><br/>Real dealbreaker number one: Humanity is a cock-blocker. So are the Paths of Enlightenment. "Oh, here are the six and a half things you are not allowed to do or you get punished." And then you get to pick the three things (Disciplines) you CAN do. Ever play a Sabbat game? Players look through the four lowest sins of every Path and then just pick the one that disallows stuff they have no interest in roleplaying to begin with. Fuck the actual philosophy of the path. Yeah, anyway. 'Tarded!<br/><br/>Real dealbreaker number two: Blood Points. Specifically, lose one per day. So essentially you're required to play out every day in your vampire's life. In-game hours and days always encourage you to keep track of actual in-game hours and days. How do you skip ahead more than 10 days? Play a few hunting scenes? Then the Storyteller's guide solved the problem! Get this: when you skip ahead a week, a moth, a year, a century, you just roll 1d10 and that's how many Blood Points you start with! Rockin! Oh, wait, I rolled a 1. Sorry, mister GM, I know you wanted to start with a somber meeting about the Prince's crushing grief, but I need a hunting scene NOW. Oh, and I'm gonna kill somebody, 'cause I can't stop myself. Ugh. Hey, guys? Scenes, maybe?<br/><br/>Sort-of dealbreaker to cap it off: Round-robin combat with I roll to hit, you roll to dodge, you roll to soak, rinse, repeat... is actually kinda boring.<br/><br/><br/>On the up side, I always thought vampires were neat, but totally boned by all those stupid limitations. Then this game came out and showed me that vampires could actually be so. fucking. cool. And I'm down with people having their favorite clans. Can you imagine a GM who says "Brujah, Ventrue, Toreador, Nosferatu, that's it"?

I think it was that we got right down to brass tacks.  He dropped a hint about this Power having a girlfriend his guards protected.  He wanted us to handle this guy with kid gloves and try and take him down in this courtly-intrigue way (blackmail, dragging him to the Locust Court, etc), but the two of us (The Power of Travel and the Power of Explosions) took umbrage at his trying to stop our Chancel from forming in a more visceral way and decided a lesson should be handed out.  The GM hit a point where he saw the game going in a direction he didn't like and we felt constrained by having a "correct solution".  The result was two groups very much unhappy what what they saw the other doing.  Attempts to address this made the GM pull the plug, since he saw our approach and his as mutually exclusive (I, for the record, did not).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205796/#Comment_205796" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-06T16:48:08+00:00" title="May  6, 2009  4:48PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Morten Greis</cite><b>Burning Empires</b>- how will ever get my players to understand all these rules?</blockquote>\nMe, too, though I'm hoping that Mouse Guard might soften them up a bit.

That's OK - most people walk out, reasonably enough, when they run out of book and the credits start to roll.  But if you stay a little longer for the actual play scene that runs afterwards, there's a fantastic surprise ending.  I hope you'll forgive me if I ruin it for you.<br/><br/>Spoiler 1: Drive 35% and Drive 85% taste exactly the same to Great Cthulhu.  Neither your Ride nor your Repair skills will help you understand that Mi-Go blinking away at you, no matter how carefully you minmax.  So stop thinking about it so much!  BRP CoC character creation should take all of about five minutes.  If it takes longer, you're doing it wrong.  <br/><br/>Spoiler 1a, with bonus heresy: d20 CoC character creation is even faster.<br/><br/>Spoiler 1b: The best and easiest drift you can do to CoC, either ruleset, is to make your own character sheet, limiting yourself to perhaps two dozen pre-populated skills and a few blanks.  This is the secret to really fast chargen.<br/><br/>Spoiler 2: Character splat is totally optional.  I've had plenty of investigators survive a dozen adventures.  The trick?  Long-lived investigators generally get that way by never getting into gunfights.  Let their choice matter.<br/><br/>Spoiler 3: Character mental splat is also totally optional.  This one is more on the GM, though.  Do you really need to manifest an Outer God to address your premise / satisfy your players' setting expectations / challenge (!) their characters?  Probably not.  Might as well kick the habit.<br/><br/>Also, there's this supplement, <i>Delta Green</i>, which in turn has supplements (<i>DG:Countdown</i> and <i>DG: Eyes Only</i>).  It could change your life.  People who don't want to play Cthulhu are often totally jazzed to play DG.<br/><br/>Sorry to thread drift, but I couldn't let this "one thing" go unremarked upon when I know it, from looooong experience, not to be so.<br/><br/><b>On topic</b>: <i>Aberrant</i>, where you select from a list of OVER 9000! almost completely unconnected powers at chargen, really bothered me.  I wanted to love <i>Aberrant</i>, because the book is a such beautiful artifact, and because it was so much less stupid than the run of the superhero-game litter, but yeesh.  What a pain.

But I love running my DB exalted game because we cut it down to pretty much just the Martial Arts and they don't get perfects.  Actually, now that I know that, I'd be fine running any flavor... you just have to keep the focus narrow.  So I don't have a problem with Exalted.  Rescinded!<br/><br/>Storming the Wizard's Tower: Still in playtest and all that, but I hate games that ask me to make a really cool character and then, if he gets too injured, ditch him for a session; I'd rather die and start over than just set him aside.  Happened in my first session, and I felt like I had totally lost the game.  But I'm not the intended audience?  I don't have a redbox childhood.  Other than that, it's a fun, light system that let's you fight monsters and be a hero, and it's fun to play the types.<br/><br/>Seven Seas: (I think that's what it's called?)

class="Message">\n                            For me I think I'd have to say Beast Hunters. it's a lovely premise, primitive tribes with no technology and little true magic battle against vicious beasts, but for three simple things. Firstly, despite some exposition about tribal politics and rivalries, it's primarily a game about hunting large, vicious beasts and the rules aren't really geared to that in the slightest. Secondly there are a few oddities in combat, specifically the way that some bonuses have to be negotiated between player and GM. But thirdly, this game is crying out to be multiplayer but it's designed for one-on-one play. To me this seems totally weird. If you were a loincloth-clad tribesman with only a spear and a sling to your name, would you want to hunt down and kill a dragon-like creature all on your own? I know I'd be taking a whole phalanx of hunters with me if I were doing it. Yes, you can play the game with more than one player, but the rules don't encourage it and the tactics aren't well-supported. In the end, it feels like a cow-punching competition more than a combat system. Not a bad system in and of itself (barring the whole negotiated bonuses thing) but one that doesn't really lend itself to its subject matter, at least in my mind.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206497/#Comment_206497" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-09T16:27:12+00:00" title="May  9, 2009  4:27PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Much of what I'm saying is echoing other points made, but....<br/><br/><i>Exalted</i> the system:  Love the setting, and so port it into other rule sets like crazy.<br/><br/><i>DnD3.x:</i> Rules optimized for combat, but combat is s-l-o-w and ho-hum, basically an HP-whittling contest.

That's OK - most people walk out, reasonably enough, when they run out of book and the credits start to roll.  But if you stay a little longer for the actual play scene that runs afterwards, there's a fantastic surprise ending.  I hope you'll forgive me if I ruin it for you.<br/><br/>If what you say is true (and I suspect it is) then there's no reason for all that to be in the book or on the character sheet. I re-submit <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> as my deal-breaker for being great in principle, and then cluttered all to hell with too many useless rules, skills, traits, scores, etc that don't make any difference to the outcome of the game or my enjoyment thereof. I shouldn't have to fight a game to enjoy it. If I ever need <i>CoC</i> action I'll do <i>Nemesis</i> or <i>Dread</i>.<br/><br/>And <i>CoC</i> where PCs live or remain sane? Psh.

Sure, you can do it once and look damn good doing it. Twice, even. But three times, without getting lucky in a few places? Not going to happen. So go ahead, blow your Strengths early and often, or just steal a few climaxi! No, really \u2014 go ahead!

That\u2019d be too easy on them. You want to wear them down, grind them under, and let them feel like they\u2019re winning along the way. \u201cSure, you can blow away all the flying monkies in Bespin \u2026 but what did it cost you? And what about this bunch of space sharks you\u2019re barely fending off now?\u201d The tension between inter-Player competition and the limited number of Strengths (and Weaknesses!) drive different Players to different resource management techniques \u2026 but they all run out sooner rather than later.</p><p>It also helps that I find <em>3:16</em> is a better game with at least three Players. The dynamic shifts to a much more cut-throat mode because you can now gang up against someone. Someone. Anyone.
