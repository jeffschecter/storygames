                    So this is another thread inspired by <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2395&amp;page=1#Item_22" rel="nofollow"><b>Awesome-o-fy... History!</b></a>, taking from Joshua Bishop-Roby's comments.  The topic, as I see it, is ideas for running historical one-shots.  
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite><br/>Some history does not need much to 'awesome-ofy' it.  Seriously, the only additions I really made to Ethan Allen is that he and the Green Mountain Boys rode moose into battle and that he was a member of the secret society Sons of Liberty.  The rest -- the independent republic of Vermont, playing the US Congress and the British off of each other, the inciting rebellions within the US just to make a point -- is right out of history.  Ethan Allen is pretty straight-up and<em>obviously</em>awesome, so he needs less work.  Others, like Thomas Paine,<em>were</em>awesome all on their own, but were not<em>obviously</em>and plainly awesome.  You have to understand their historical context in order to understand their awesome.<br/><br/>Now, in a long-form game where you immerse and get to know the historical background and cultural context and everything, the players can learn how awesome these elements of history are.  For my purposes in this game, which is pick up and play and runs in one session, that's not an option.<em>SoL</em>is high-color, visceral, and crazy-go-nuts so that it can be immediately appreciated.</blockquote>
Interesting.  I've run or played in a number of historical one-shot adventures, generally without speculative elements.  From my experience, the keys to a historical one-shot would be: <br/><br/>(1) picking a period of history which the players can at least visually picture, typically by being the subject of popular films -- WWII is good, Victorian London (i.e. Sherlock Holmes), Vikings, colonial-era Native Americans, pirate-era Carribean, and so forth.  For me, the American Revolutionary War is a little iffy because while the basic facts are well-known (at least to Americans), most people don't have a strong picture.  <br/>(2) Have very simple / archetypal / over-the-top personalities.  They can be archetypes from other genres transposed -- i.e. like a hard-boiled medieval detective, etc.<br/>(3) Focus on a narrow slice of the history and explain it carefully.  There should be a single conflict, person, or event which is the center of all the other historical pieces in the game.  <br/><br/>My sadly unfinished larp <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/morpholondinium/" rel="nofollow"><b>Morpho Londinium</b></a> fails on <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> but does reasonably on <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>.  In general, I've reserved speculative elements like moose-riding for campaign games -- because to my mind, they take extra time to understand and make sense out of.  They're not in the source material, and I at least find they complicate my understanding of how things work.  (i.e. What does riding on a moose do to war?  Are they fast scouts like cavalry?)  <br/><br/>I guess the good way for a speculative element is if it substitutes in for a real historical element.  i.e. The moose riding symbolizes the ethos and power of Ethan Allen. The insect identification of Morpho Londinium isn't speculative per se, but I can see how it fills that role.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>

                            This is probably an area where we can learn a lot from LARPs: there are loads of historical one-shot LARPs and they're very successful.<br/><br/>I like the first and third points: especially the bit about there being a single conflict at the centre of the game. I'm not sure about the archetypal, over-the-top personalities. The advantage of these is that they instantly give the characters attitudes, objectives and generally things to do. But I think there's other ways to do this: many LARPs just give their characters objectives straight off.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Historical fiction sources that people are familiar with can work pretty good as a basis. NPCs can be a great way to introduce aspects of the setting that the players might not be familiar with.
<ul>
<li><b>The Three Musketeers </b>- everyone has at least a basic idea what it's about and what kind of characters there are. I ran a one-shot a little bit ago that was basically riffing on one chapter from the Three Musketeers. It worked pretty well.</li>
<li><b>Pride and Prejudice </b>- you may get groans initially, but there's lots you can do with tense social drama where all the characters have interrelated passions, secrets, and grudges, most of them terribly secret.</li>
<li><b>Ancient Rome</b> - start with something everyone understands, like gladiators, then work in the Imperial politics</li>
<li><b>Shakespeare</b> - the back story of Romeo and Juliet is an awesome setup for an adventure, especially when the characters show up in town and both factions want something from them.</li>
</ul> </div>

                            Anything involving scheming, potentially/probably untrustworthy partners with their own agendas should make great game material. Heck, that should cover just about anything involving criminals, spies,revolutionaries, most politics and a few things I'm forgetting. That's a little drama that just plain repeats throughout history with mostly a change of set design and costuming.                        </div>
