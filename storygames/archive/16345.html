If you run games at multiple venues and your reputation as a GM is important to you, then having reliable go-to scenarios that you can do extra prep to make the game run even more smoothly is a great thing (Jenskot/John S in particular has spent a lot of time and effort on this part of public GMing), and people who hear about that game but didn't get in for whatever reason will want to play with you in THAT setting. If you've got any kind of rep, it also means that your tables won't get taken over by the same 5 or 6 people for the whole Con: running the same scenario means you'll see more, different players.<br/><br/>Even with straight-up railroads like a DnD 4e set-piece adventure the players will surprise you, and it'll go a little smoother every time you run it. If nothing else, having a nicely laid-out batch of materials like the Fiasco Kits that Steve S brought to PAXE will minimize the non-playing time, which is always a good thing, and makes Fiasco, a game that by its nature is different every time out, as quick out of the gate as it can manage to be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373234/#Comment_373234" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-17T11:49:35+00:00" title="April 17, 2012 11:49AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will run Against the Cult of the Reptile God in any system, in any setting, at any time.

I don't vary it much from game to game because I'm trying to give everyone a similar introduction to the game. Different groups engage with it at a different pace so I hurry things along or slow it down as necessary. I've only once had to use someone's drive to encourage them to investigate. And I've always enjoyed running it, there's always at least some slight difference in the how the players react and they always enjoy it (as far as I can tell).<br/><br/>I've run my Trail of Cthulhu Paris scenario four times now. Once with the regular group and then at two conventions, once in Milton Keynes and twice in Paris. It started out as a semi-improvised game in which I had an idea of what might happen and dumped a load of clues on the players at the start. The clues haven't changed but I've certainly firmed up the background and the plot so it makes more sense, gives the players leads which are all worthy of investigation, leading deeper into the mystery and leave the GM space to really mess with the players' heads.<br/><br/>I wrote a Hellboy GURPS scenario set in Mexico which I flogged to the MiB programme. I've run that a few times and the only major difference is that I changed the key ingredient in the banishment from virgin menstrual blood to something else because it got a bit sillier than I'd hoped during one run of the game. Not all groups will deal with such concepts in an adult fashion. This is a sequel to an adventure I wrote based in Chicago tennements. The only thing I changed in that between runs was that SJG objected to running the investigation as a flashback to the opening scene in which the team faces off against a demon. I thought it matched the comic experience, but there you go.<br/><br/>Come to think of it, I've run the same Traveller game for BITS quite a few times. It's a convention one-shot and differs in the amount of fighting that is required. Some groups take an age to plan things so I have to keep the shooting short and bloody. Others just go for it so there's some urban snipping to contend with.<br/><br/>I've also run the same Dogs game, Fort Lemon, about 6 times. It's pretty brutal and can usually ends with a lot of dead people. My main aim is to push people's buttons and to see how they react. This varies from group to group, doesn't always please everyone but is memorable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373265/#Comment_373265" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-17T14:50:04+00:00" title="April 17, 2012  2:50PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 17, 2012 2:50PM by Carl.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've run the same Dogs town many times (mostly Tower Creek or Judd's New Gidea) and summarized my thoughts on it in <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=18826.0" rel="nofollow">Why I like Tower Creek so much</a>:<br/><br/>In the mid-80's I ran the same Champions adventure ("The Last Hero") with pre-generated PCs at conventions about a dozen times, both in tournament and single-session forms.

That is, many adventures, like many dungeons, are a series of interconnected facts and details (i.e., not variables) that remain constant or near-constant regardless of the player group. In a GUMSHOE scenario, the mysterious killer at the heart of it all may be the same every time you play. (It also may change, depending.)<br/><br/>In a situation, things are set up and then things unfold in any direction via riffing, improvisation, and the collision of molten ideas. Lady Blackbird is near this end of the spectrum, in that it is mostly background and setup and then explodes out wherever the players go.<br/><br/>I think this is a spectrum, with situation at one end and something\u2014I'm saying <i>adventure</i>, but I'd be happy with an alternative, maybe <i>dungeon</i>, even\u2014at the other end. Most actual play lives somewhere in between and, in fact, probably causes the needle to dance along the spectrum.<br/><br/>So when we say improvised scenarios don't count for replay lessons, we're drawing an arbitrary line near one end of the spectrum, in my opinion. <br/><br/>Put another way, there's a lot of overlap in what you learn replaying improv situations and detailed adventures, in my experience. There's a lot that's different, too, sure. But a lot is also the same.<br/><br/>One great way to test this out is to compose a small dungeon environment\u2014a course through adventure that is fictionally limited by sturdy fictional barriers like dungeon walls\u2014and play it with different groups. I've played a few dungeons several times through various editions of D&amp;D, for example, and learned a lot through the process. Playing the same situation in different ways teaches similar lessons but is harder to chart because you have fewer fixed points for reference.<br/><br/>Running the same adventure or dungeon over and over is a great educational process and great practice. I either improvise to a large degree or I fall back on a few beloved adventures because I've honed them, practiced them, and internalized them. Great fun.<br/><br/>Simon, we should get you to run the same scenario (for any one system), once per convention, at every convention you attend, for one year. It'll be a great experience, I think. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373450/#Comment_373450" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-18T11:35:36+00:00" title="April 18, 2012 11:35AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Because I mostly improvise, and what the players feed to the table changes everything dramatically. The more I run a scenario, the more ideas I can quickly inject from previous sessions, making it richer when I'm the one who needs to feed stuff to the table.<br/><br/>I take issue with this level of improvisation, even though I have no adventure or NPCs written down, as somehow not the same adventure. This is how I run all my games. Bare minimum preparation. It also helps combat my desire to run something new. It will be new even though it's the same set up as before.<br/><br/>I think this fits because I'm still talking about specific scenarios.  For example, I've run <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6069" rel="nofollow">Crash Landing on Ganymede</a> multiple times, which is a <i>Spirit of the Century</i> scenario for my retro-sci-fi setting. The cast of characters to choose from is the same. The kicker is the same. The general problem is the same - unless the players take a different direction or a better one comes up as a possibility.<br/><br/>I'm not counting <i>In A Wicked Age</i> or <i>Fiasco</i> where the components are generated at the table and even similar elements create different scenarios and characters. If you start with the same scenario set-up and the same characters (barring edits to fix problems) it's the same adventure.<br/><br/>It's a great way to learn a system and learn how to tweak pre-gen characters and story hooks to make them more engaging. It doesn't just help you improve the scenario you're running (that may not be important), but it helps you improve your skills running anything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373468/#Comment_373468" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-18T13:03:06+00:00" title="April 18, 2012  1:03PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon Rogers</cite><a href="/forums/profile/Jim">@Jim</a> Crocker - the fact it forces you to run the game for a completely new set of players is also a very useful outcome, particularly if you are honing your adventure or GMing abilities.</blockquote>\nExactly!

It actually reminds me of when I used to teach at the Junior High School level: I would often run the same class some 5-7 times. By the latter half, I learned very well what did or didn't work, how to tighten my explanations, which jokes were funnier than others, what got people excited, and in the process I found little ways to make it better. So that by the last time the session/class was held, I almost felt sorry for that first class that got the raw/un-tightened version of the class. It's kinda like stand-up, I think.<br/><br/>Anyway, the same lessons apply to RPGs, in games with a GM anyway: Running the same scenario over and over can help tighten it up in all those ways above. And once you learn those things, you can immediately apply them to your next (different) scenario as well in at least some capacity.<br/><br/>You learn the little changes, twists, intonations, explanations, descriptions, gestures, etc that work to bring your group into the action, and which ones don't fly.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
