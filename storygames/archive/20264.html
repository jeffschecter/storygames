But when did it start ? I began playing roleplaying games in the early 90s and while some games suggested such behaviour through its texts (Paranoia, Vampire, etc) I dont remember seeing actual methods, nor rules, for making it happen in a effective manner. It was almost always just loose advice that ended up ignored more often then not.<br/><br/>The curious thing is that I had this thought while playing a videogame called Persona 3 on a playstation 2 emulator, a game released in 2005 that has a neat "social link" mechanic where your character improves in power the more he explores the bonds with his colleagues. I came to realize that Ive never seen such a thing in my youth. I mean, sure we had videogames with parties and all, but having intra-party relationship coming to the fore looks somewhat novel in videogames, no ? <br/><br/>So, is this some pattern through some medias ? The earlier "party drama"-focused roleplaying games I know of also came out more or less during this period (BW, Dogs and Mountain Witch in 2003~5 ? ). Was this period the beginning of this kind of thing ? Or there were games of this kind before ?<br/><br/>Perhaps more importantly: is this kind of conscious promotion of intra-party drama in our games something new(ish) ?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Isaac" title="Isaac"><img alt="Isaac" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Isaac">Isaac</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446415/#Comment_446415" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T01:42:00+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  1:42AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the drama, or for the mechanics supporting the drama?

I definitely had PvP action in my early gaming in the late 70s.<br/><br/>As the game shifted from open sandboxes with players coming and going, with a single "party" campaign, things started shifting and PvP action started to be seen as antisocial activity in most cases (I think the way Paranoia was played was actually a reaction to all this non-PvP play).<br/><br/>Heck, I've even read about groups mounting assaults on other campaigns in the era of characters being allowed to move from one campaign to another.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446423/#Comment_446423" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T05:10:29+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  5:10AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd argue there's a profound difference between "we are competing for the same goal" and "our characters have different, and conflicting, philosophies."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446425/#Comment_446425" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T06:01:22+00:00" title="July 14, 2015  6:01AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, in Paranoia your secret society boss tells you to kill the other player character.

Typically the same standard resolution mechanics are used for conflicts with PCs or NPCs alike, with no special provision for "betrayal" mechanics (well, Poison'd has one, but it only applies to a specific subset of situations). You can see these as TMW descendants as well, or maybe not.<br/>The two lines come together in <i>Apocalypse World</i>, really, where Hx is an explicitly TMW-derived bit and player-characters come with a complex bunch of implied goals, both common and conflicting, with initial play sessions often devolved to establishing or clarifying such goals.<br/>EDITED TO ADD: but then, in AW, we're well beyond any sort of "party" (though I've heard of people who do play it that way).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares" title="Ricardo Tavares"><img alt="Ricardo Tavares" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/695/nIETVNBV4ZU51.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares">Ricardo Tavares</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446624/#Comment_446624" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-15T14:05:46+00:00" title="July 15, 2015  2:05PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 15, 2015 2:06PM by Ricardo Tavares.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Yeah, my curiosity is about when games started to portray techniques and mechanics that promote such behavior.</blockquote>I would also put my money on Paranoia as probably being the first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446654/#Comment_446654" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-15T18:25:16+00:00" title="July 15, 2015  6:25PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 15, 2015 6:26PM by Paul_T.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd say that there is a definite line between games where the players compete against each other (relatively rare, I think), and games where the Characters are at odds with one another, in order to produce drama. (Let's not overlook LARPs in this sense!)<br/><br/>The former fits with a very specific kind of play, and is rare in typical "RPG campaigns" (until more recent designs, as pointed out above). The latter starts as soon as we have an interest in good stories, since most good stories cannot exist with a group of completely friendly people doing something together. Usually stories have either a single protagonist or a bunch of protagonists who are somehow at odds; more modern game designs have started to focus on this more intently since "telling good stories" became an interest. (Vampire probably has a role to play in here somewhere, in terms of mass-market success.)<br/><br/>I've never played Toon (1984). Does that have inter-character conflict, or do the cartoons act as a team all the time?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446663/#Comment_446663" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-15T19:20:36+00:00" title="July 15, 2015  7:20PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It started when Bob joined the party.
