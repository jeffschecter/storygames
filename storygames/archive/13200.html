I'm only counting people who regularly attend the group, because those are the only ones I see.  (Someone else in our group does all the recruiting.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dionysus</cite>What sort of group size do you guys run with?<br/>How long are your normal games? What type of game are they?</blockquote>\n2 to 6 players, but usually it's 5 players.  We play once a week, typically a 3-hour session.  We mostly play long-arc games: the average campaign goes about 3-4 months, then we bring it to an end and move on to a new game, usually one in a new genre because we're tired of the old one.  We do a lot of science fiction games, some superhero games, a shitton of modern-day games of various kinds (action movie pastiches, horror, urban horror, urban fantasy, whatever).  We do some historical games, usually early 20th-century stuff.  Straight fantasy games don't usually get played.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dionysus</cite>Do you have any rules for "must have X players to have a game" or something like that?</blockquote>\nAt least two players, no more than six.  3-5 players is the sweet spot where our games really hum, so that's what we aim for.<br/><br/>EDIT TO ADD:  In terms of "how many people need to show up for us to play," it varies depending on the game.  Generally we go in with a firm schedule (every Friday night, every Saturday, every other Wednesday, whatever) that we've decided on mutually.  If someone can't make it one week, they generally let everyone know in advance and we decide what we're going to do about it right then and there.  Depending on the game and the circumstances, the rest of us might get together and watch a movie or just hang out, or we'll skip that week, or we'll play without the missing person, or we'll play something else.<br/><br/>Back when I was much younger, I was in a few groups with a "eh, show up if you can, we'll see who's there on game night" policy, and that sucked:  in the long run, it's easier and less stressful to just game with people who can commit to a schedule and who'll call you and tell you if something's come up and they have to cancel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297363/#Comment_297363" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-19T09:27:16+00:00" title="October 19, 2010  9:27AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Have any of you tried episodic games?

It ended up that we only played at the game store once and never really took advantage of the episodic aspect.<br/><br/>I had a long running Traveller campaign back in the day that really only had one committed player. Other players would come and go. Generally, PCs of non-present players would be exempt from planetary ground teams and we never ended a session with folks on the ground.<br/><br/>Dogs in the Vinyard is well suited to an episodic campaign, though I have a hard time getting into a campaign that would be so episodic in nature. Ultimately, what keeps me from being excited about running a DitV campaign is that it feels like there is nothing for the GM to build up on.<br/><br/>So for me to be invested in an episodic campaign, there has to be something tangible I am building upon as the GM. I think it would also need a core of players who were regular (even if it might occasionally happen that from one week to the next, there were no players in common, so long as each week there were at least some players who played on some kind of regular basis.<br/><br/>An episodic campaign with circulating players would also either have to have player independent prep, or there would have to be reasonable notice who was going to show up.

The others join in for roughly 1d10-1 sessions per year. We have one potential gamer waiting in the shadows. <br/><br/><b>What sort of group size do you guys run with?</b><br/>GM+3 (or somewhat more rarely GM+2) is the norm. <br/><br/><b>How long are your normal games? What type of game are they?</b><br/>Session-wise it's something over 2 hours if we're pressed for time (rather not play if we have less than that). At least 4 hours standard I'd say.  6+ hours on rare evenings. <br/><br/>Campaign-wise, I really can't say. We've played a bunch of one-shots in the last year, with quite a few failed attempts at long-term games (most of them failed after 1-2 sessions). High-school was the period of the last great campaigns that could have lasted a year or more. Now we're trying to get back into long-term games but the longest we've managed so far has been 6 or 7 sessions. Pretty good, but not really that long.

Well, if it's just GM+1, then we don't bother. If we have a regular game running and a regular doesn't show up we're also pretty icky about playing that night. We'd rather skip and wait for him to be available.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297506/#Comment_297506" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-19T16:41:46+00:00" title="October 19, 2010  4:41PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dionysus</cite>Can you expand what you are referring to with "player independent prep" What are the players preparing exactly?<br/></blockquote>\nPerhaps I should have said "PC independent prep" In other words, prep that doesn't care who the PCs are. In Burning Wheel, prep has to be relevant to beliefs, well, I guess it could be independent if the players wrote new beliefs to hit the prep you did. In a DitV campaign, I would expect the GM to build towns in reaction to what the PCs did in previous sessions.<br/><br/>If the GM doesn't know which PCs will be present, it's hard to prep anything that is best when it is specific to a PC.<br/><br/>An old school megadungeon of course is expected to be designed independent of the PCs, so any prep done for that would be PC/Player independent. Of course even there, I suspect GMs started to prep in anticipation of their players, Got players who hate certain kinds of dungeon features, and do everything in their power to bypass them? You might decide to stop using those features, or you might decide to force the PCs into them. Of course if you push too hard, the players quit, so perhaps you decide to remove some features because otherwise you will lose your players.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297518/#Comment_297518" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-19T18:10:44+00:00" title="October 19, 2010  6:10PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>How big is your pool or RPG players?</b><br/><br/>My roster shows nine people.

We might return to that game again later, but we consider 8-12 a 'season' and then discuss if we want to commission a second 'season'.<br><br>We have tried a couple of models over time. Our older model was to have one 'main' game, but have an alternate in case the GM could not make it, or people whose presence was needed for a session. That failed a bit, because the time between sessions on the alternate made it too hard to get into the groove. So we switched to running some kind of 'one-shot' on those weeks. For a long time our one-shot has been, run IAWA, but I think we are burnt out on that for a while. I'm suggesting we prepare some more con-style one shots, with pre-gens, for games someone has always wanted to try, but thinks he is unlikely to get group buy in for a few sessions.<br><br>We try to alternate the type of game, but they are usually small press.

People who play weekly or bi-weekly... 26 but was much higher before many people moved away because of work or family. The economy has taken away many close friends :-(  <br/><br/><b>What sort of group size do you guys run with?</b><br/>If I'm running... 3-4. But many of my friends want as many players as possible, making it more like a party than a traditional game. They will usually run for 7-10+ players which to me is crazy unless we are playing games that specifically handle that. <br/><br/><b>How long are your normal games? </b><br/>3-4 hours<br/><br/><b>What type of game are they?</b><br/>Anything that can be played in less than 4 hours. But if it's weeknights we play in public spaces and are restricted by table space... games with minis tend to be out. Weekends table space is a non-issue. <br/><br/><b>Do you have any rules for "must have X players to have a game" or something like that?</b><br/>2-3 players (not including the GM) for an RPG. But if less people are available we'll play a boardgame, watch a movie, grab or make food. Socializing is our number 1 priority and we will choose a game to fit around the situation at hand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298126/#Comment_298126" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-24T07:03:28+00:00" title="October 24, 2010  7:03AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Have any of you tried episodic games?</b><br/>We've played episodic games with D&amp;D, Dogs in the Vineyard, Mouse Guard, Shadowrun, Mutants &amp; Masterminds, and Call of Cthulhu. They work well but it's a different experience. Great for socializing! <br/><br/>But I find it takes 3-4 sessions of a game with the same group before we really sync up with each other, with our characters, and with the game itself. On the other extreme, I don't like super long term campaigns because I like to play a variety of games with a variety of people. <br/><br/>My preferred method of play is a 6 session weekly game with 1-2 spots open for rotating players. For most of us the game is a very short dedicated campaign, for some of us it's episodic. For me this is the best of both worlds.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
