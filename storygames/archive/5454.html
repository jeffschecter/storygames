Basically I created a rules system and setting(s) in high school in 1978, and I've played it happily ever since.   In 1994 I started programming my rules, and in 1996 began the project proper with a couple of high school friends.  We're all D&amp;Der's from the days of old.   So basically the rules have been play tested with my friends between 1978 and 1994, and I've gotten the old double plus good thumbs up on them.  So now I'm working on putting them into a form that can be used by others.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn 2006 I started the Literary Role Playing Game Society of Westchester with some local folks.  We're dedicated to the proposition that we can create literary quality worlds, ala Tolkien, CS Lewis, George MacDonald, Charles Williams (note all members of the Inklings of Oxford) and apply them to our RPGs (which tend to be homebrews).   We were having meetings at ye old local pub.   I started hanckering for a mini-system we could use to run game ideas at the pub.   So I began what was supposed to be a short phase of the project distilling down my main rules into a mini-system.   That system resolved over the next six months into The One Die System.   It's a miniature of my basic rules, and handles everything that the main rules do, but with tiny numbers and runs on one six sided die.   Yup, I know it's impossible, but there you have it.   Being a programmer by trade, and having the core system rules already programmed to completion (Elthos Prime), I decided it would be a great fun thing to do to migrate to a web interface.  So I started with the ODS system to do that since the code is clean, the rules are a simplified version.   So now I'm almost done with that aspect.   Following?  I know this is kinda complicated setup.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, while all this was going on, I've also been working on Elthos setting.   That's also a big project, and somewhat disconnected from the rules in so far as you could potentially play the setting with any rules system.   It's just I've always played it with my rules.   The setting is not so much a story with history and details about what happened in the world.  It's more of a framework of symbolic relationships between geographies, deities, and various kinds of creatures and things in the world that form a network of correspondences that can be used by the GM (me) to help guide the back story of the game, and provide symbolism that remains coherent over time.   I do, of course, have core Elthos histories and such that have come out of play over the years, but for other GMs I think those stories would serve most likely as simply and example of an Elthos Implementation, rather than a "You must use this history".   So I'm also starting the process of working on the setting book (ok, so I'm almost almost ready to start working on that), but I do have a steadily cohesifying visual display of correspondence network, which is very handy (at least for me so far).   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe main focus for me of the Elthos setting is The Hero's Journey, and as such I'm working on a system to template various world mythologies into what I'm calling Mythic Templates.   These are story arcs that follow certain classical themes and utilized certain archetype characters, which I've associated to the Tarot and Astrology.   The whole system is linked to a basic D&amp;Dish alignment system which I've mathematically rationalized for use in my game.  So far I think the system appears to be working out well, and I've been able to use the core concepts of the system to generate some pretty great stories from the game.   I will be publishing examples as time permits.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what am I up to at this point?  Game testing on the ODS Rules, the Application, and the GM's use of the Elthosian Symbolic Framework are the next step.   I live in Westchester NY.   If anyone is interested in helping me with some game testing at any level, please drop  me a line.   Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - Thanks you guys at Dreamation for the enthusiasm and hard-knuckle Game Design Panels!   Ready to take the next leap!    Luke, Fred, Rob, and the rest of you guys have really given me some great feedback and motivation!

My offer still stands to review it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have good answers for the Big Three Questions?<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Willow,<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!   What is probably ready for review at this point is the core ODS Rules Book.   What would be great is to get a review of that in terms of 1) text 2) system.    The purpose of the ODS is to provide a very light weight game for use by the Literary RPG Society or similar groups that want to run a RPG in a public setting where they won't need a lot of 'stuff' to do so, such as books, and dice, and stuff.   It's a fast paced game, that may well serve, actually, as a fun drinking game.  Characters can be rolled in five minutes or less.   The rules can be memorized and the math done in one's head.   It uses one six sided die for equipment.   At the same time it allows for a wide diversity of RPG mechanics such as the use of skills and magic, combat, tactics, and so on.   However, what it doesn't cover is the setting.   The caveat is that the game is geared toward the traditional style of RPG - only with tiny numbers, and has basic D&amp;Dish mechanics.   If you're not into that style of play then you probably won't like this rules system.   The other thing it doens't talk about is creative agenda.  I'm leaving both setting and gamesmastering/playing techniques for another book in order to distinquish between the two and separate them.   That way people who like the rules can use them for whatever setting and with whatever creative agenda rules they like, and still not be made to feel that they're "not playing this right" or having to "cheat".   I will get to the other books later on, but am working on them or towards them.   The ODS PDF is not completely finished, and I have a couple of new items to add to it that will make a difference regarding the use of clericy in the game.   So that should be ready soon for review (probably no later than Friday week).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the Big Three Questions... I saw something a while back called the Power 19, but I wasn't entirely sure I quite understood if this was the same thing as The Big Three or not.   Anyway, in my head I thought I had answers for at least most of the questions.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I'm really looking for are play testers at this point.   Just a few new people to kick the game around the block with and find kinks.   I'm not on the fast track in terms of production on this project, as you can tell, and it's a big project in terms of scope, so there's a lot of work to do on several fronts.   At this phase I could use a hand finding play testers.   Would you know anyone in the Westchester area, or recommend ways to get play testers?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VBWyrde" title="VBWyrde"><img alt="VBWyrde" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VBWyrde">VBWyrde</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122271/#Comment_122271" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T05:00:13+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  5:00AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: Anders NygaardThe mythic template thing sounds very interesting. Is there a website?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm wondering if you've read these - Kenneth Hite and Van Leavenworth discussing something similar in regard to the Chtulhu mythos.<br/>\nhttp://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/firstperson/adventurous<br/>\nhttp://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/firstperson/adventurousrip<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the links, I will definitely check them out after work tonight.  As for the Mythic Templates, that's probably the most challenging part of this project so far.  It requires an inordinant amount of research and contemplation.   I have one card prototyped, and one in very rough draft, and two more conceptually designed in my head.   I'm trying to do them right, so it's not just something that I'm kinda throwing together hodge podge.  They're very well researched, and conceptually the symbolism ties in with an extended system I'm creating for the Astro-Tarot cards that I'm working on in conjunction with these.  The two sets of cards are integrated so as to work within the overall cosmological system smoothly.   There's nothing arbitrary about it - which is why it takes so much research to put it together, and then iron out the kinks.   When I'm a little further along with the cards I'll post them online and ask for review, but I'm not 100% sure how soon that will be.  I want to have at least six cards prototyped before I do that, and I'm thinking that at the current rate of development it will be a couple of months or so, maybe more.   The reason I mention it up here early is just to give an idea of where my game is going in order to hopefully spark some play tester interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now what I'm looking for are play testers to just help me try out the concepts in rough to cover basic usability questions and make sure that the concept holds water in play where I have a group of players who don't necessarily know the system.   I'm searching for play testers in the Westchester NY area (Tri-State).   I really just need a few players to start.  I thought I'd post up here to get the ball rolling and see if anyone might be able to help me find a few.   Any leads on this aspect would be great.

Great, thanks.  <br/><br/>Well, I just wrote a truly elegant explaination of the Mythic Template system, but my session timed out and when I posted it - it was lost forever.   Oh well, whatever.  In (very) brief the Mythic Template cards are to be used as an aid for World Weaving (back story development), and tie into the Astro-Tarot system which is useful for both World Weaving and in-game applications.   I would try to rewrite the four beautiful paragraphs I just lost on the topic, but I'm frankly too frustrated at the moment to do so, nor can I remember exactly how I phrased things before.  I'll try again later.  <br/><br/>As for the play test materials, great, thanks.  I should have something by the end of the week.  I'll get in touch then.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122318/#Comment_122318" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T08:46:37+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  8:46AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So... what is the game about?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VBWyrde" title="VBWyrde"><img alt="VBWyrde" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VBWyrde">VBWyrde</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122343/#Comment_122343" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T10:26:43+00:00" title="January 28, 2008 10:26AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2008 10:27AM by VBWyrde.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: Willow<br/>\nSo... what is the game about?<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, the game is open ended in terms of the ODS Rules (and the larger more complex core rules for the prime system).  In terms of setting it is also open ended, in that the Elthos world covers a lot of territory in terms of genre by virtue of the geographic symbolism intrinsic to the world.   So the setting is open ended in that the GM and/or Players can decide for themselves what they want to do with it.   What is established in the setting is the mytho-symbolic framework, which is linked to the astro-tarot deck and the mythic template cards.   Within that structure the GM and/or Players (depending on your prefered creative agenda model) can determine storylines, history, etc, that would make sense for their game.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, there is *my* Elthos story, and it has it's own history, politics, fables, etc.   For that, which other people might like, the game is about The Heroe's Journey.   It focuses on the Hallows Quests of Sovereignty, the path to kingship, the cause of the wasted land, and the reserection of the human spirit after catastrophic failure.   I play it as a game that encourages teamwork, planning, risk taking, and the spirit of adventure.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, you can play it any way, dark and foreboding, chaotic and freedom-loving, lawful and chivilric, lawful and grim, ... just depending on what you are interested in and find fun.   So... my example game will be my current World, which is about Chivalry and the Hallows Quest.   Other GMs will be able to see in this example how the game system works and how things pin to the Astro-Tarot system to make them work for their own worlds settings.   So, ultimately, the game is about what you as the world weaver want it to be about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VBWyrde" title="VBWyrde"><img alt="VBWyrde" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VBWyrde">VBWyrde</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122479/#Comment_122479" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T15:22:20+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  3:22PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's my blog, btw:<br/><br/><a href="http://ElthosRPG.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://ElthosRPG.blogspot.com</a><br/><br/>Also, I am one of the co-founders of the Literary Role Playing Game Society of Westchester and our Yahoo Group is located here:<br/><br/><a href="http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/LRPGSW" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/LRPGSW</a><br/><br/>My Elthos Game Website is still under construction, but if you want to check out the draft version which is so-so, but will be improving soon, here is the website:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.Elthos.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.Elthos.com</a><br/><br/>Ok, well once again, thanks for whatever feedback you care to offer!<br/><br/>- Mark                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122531/#Comment_122531" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T19:07:25+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  7:07PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok Mark, let's try this again.<br/><br/>What's your "elevator pitch."<br/><br/>Suppose I'm standing next to you in an elevator, or we meet in line for food, or you have a stall at a major game convention and I'm passing by.<br/><br/>You mention you're publishing a game.

It focuses on the Hallows Quests of Sovereignty, the path to kingship, the cause of the wasted land, and the reserection of the human spirit after catastrophic failure. I play it as a game that encourages teamwork, planning, risk taking, and the spirit of adventure. The setting is embodied in two sets of cards, an Astro-Tarot deck, and a set of Mythic Template cards which are used in conjunction to help build the story world, and guide it during play.<br/><br/>It has two Rule Systems, either of which can be used, and both of which come with extensive computer support.  One, there is an ultra light-weight RPG system that I designed for fast and furious games that require very little learning time, and very little equipment.  The rules can be learned in a half hour and memorized.<br/><br/>The second system is the larger more complete rule system which expands the first system outward and completes it, and would be used for more comprehensive long term games where players want to focus more on character and plot development within the game.<br/><br/>Ok.  How's THAT?   <br/><br/>In terms of 'elevator pitch' its what I'd say are the most important basic elements of what I'm working on.

However, I'll give you one example that pertains to how Cosmological Mapping of the Astro-Tarot System is intended to be used during the World Weaving phase of campaign design.   <br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Pluto is in Sagittarius.  Venus is in Libra.   Mercury is in Venus.  This means that the Libra has its home planet Venus within it\u2019s celestial region, and therefore Libra (Justice) and Venus (the Empress) are both double their normal power.   Libra, an Air sign, also has the Air planet Mercury, and therefore is at an even more optimal state of power, but for a short period of time since Mercury moves swiftly through the zodiac as does Venus.   Pluto, a water planet, on the other hand is in the Fire sign of Sagittarius.  Water is neutral to fire (classical astrology), and so neither Pluto nor Sagittarius are effected by this in terms of power level.  Pluto, since it moves very slowly, will be in Sagittarius for a long time, and therefore it\u2019s influences tend to be cultural, broad based, and change slowly.  Thus, the temple of the Elkron Pluto (Hades), is at a neutral level of power, and for a long time.  Someday it will be at the height of its power, and then for a long time as well, as it will also be at a low ebb of power when it enters Taurus, where it will also remain for a long time.  Death moves slowly around the Celestial Island of Elthos.  But for now it is neutral.   <br/><br/>Thus, the region of Sartar (the South Eastern part of the Obsidian Empire, known as the Desert of the Crimson Sands where the Red-Antmen dwell with the fiery races) is Neutral in power (assuming no other planets are in Sartor\u2019s region of the sky).  The Crimson King is in a stable position, with his armies at the ready, and the population stable in terms of productivity and cultural mood (no rebellions flaring at this time).<br/><br/>On the other hand the realm of Libra is at a (temporary) height of power, with Mercury and Venus in Libra at the same time (which happens once every year or so, and then only for a few days).  Thus, Libra, whose Tarot / Jungian Archetype is Justice, is at the height of her powers.  It is then that the King of Oswaldia is advised by the high priestess of Libra to send for the Hammer of Law from the temple of Justice so that Roland and his peers might go on the quest to seek the Spear of Destiny, for he is advised that only by Justice can the spear be wrested from its terrifying guardian - the Giant Scorpion Hzbrados (Death Sting).  With the success of that Quest Oswald will be one step closer to aquiring the needed sacred Hallows to heal the wasteland, and set to rights the grievous wrongs which plague the land from the south.<br/><br/>And so, with the Hammer of Law in his hands, Roland and the Peers venture forth, lances high, white banners flapping in the breeze, and gallantly charge off to the Western Mountains under the rising twin stars, Venus and Mercury, gleaming above the horizon...<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>That is just a hypothetical example, but gives some idea of how the system is intended to be used by world weavers to guide the symbolic influences that may shape a world and give depth, inner meaning and symbolic coherency to the back story.  I'm leaving out, for the sake of brevity, the technical mechanics of how this is done.   It should, I hope, at least provide you with the conceptual framework of how the Astro-Tarot section pertains to World Weaving.   There are, as I say, other uses, but those are both in development and rather a bit more complicated to explain (mostly because they are under development).  Nevertheless, does that help?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122848/#Comment_122848" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T17:56:46+00:00" title="January 29, 2008  5:56PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Nevertheless, does that help?"<br/><br/>No Mark, that is the exact opposite of helping.<br/><br/>Why should I care about any of this stuff?  Hero's Journey, right?  I want to play Gilgamesh.  Gilgamesh doesn't care about Saturn or Sartar or any of that stuff.

That is a pretty cool (if very complex) pacing mechanic for a rich set of faction interactions, but I have to agree, it doesn't really look like there's any obvious place in it for Hero's Journey stuff. <br/><br/>And indeed, in your example text, the hero - I'm presuming Roland - doesn't interact at all with the signs or Tarot elements. They seem to just kind of be determining the environment. Unless there's some clear, causal link between all the sign interactions and the start of Roland's quest, but it seems like that could have come out of anywhere. What's the link? I mean, how does all the astrological stuff <i>work</i> to make a heroic situation?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VBWyrde" title="VBWyrde"><img alt="VBWyrde" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VBWyrde">VBWyrde</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122853/#Comment_122853" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T18:34:07+00:00" title="January 29, 2008  6:34PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm.

But when asked "What is your game about in 15 seconds?"  the short answer is The Hero's Journey.  But really that's just a part of it.   You may say, well you should narrow it down, but then... it would no longer be my game.   I have been playing and building Elthos for 30 years.   It's a feast, not a snack.   If you're not hungry for a feast, that's ok.  It has snacks in it, too.   And The Hero's Journey is what I'd call, a main dish.   <br/><br/>In any case, I'll think about what you've said, and get back to you later if I can come up with anything.<br/><br/>The truth is that what I'm hoping to find here are some people in the New York area who would be interested in play testing the rules system at this point.   However, it doesn't look like I'm going to have much luck with that.   Can you recommend anyone or a forum or something that might help me with that?   That would be great!

That is a pretty cool (if very complex) pacing mechanic for a rich set of faction interactions, but I have to agree, it doesn't really look like there's any obvious place in it for Hero's Journey stuff.<br/><br/>And indeed, in your example text, the hero - I'm presuming Roland - doesn't interact at all with the signs or Tarot elements. They seem to just kind of be determining the environment. Unless there's some clear, causal link between all the sign interactions and the start of Roland's quest, but it seems like that could have come out of anywhere. What's the link? I mean, how does all the astrological stuff<i>work</i>to make a heroic situation?</blockquote>\nHi Misuba,<br/><br/>Thanks for commenting.   I appreciate that.  I'll try to explain how this works.  <br/><br/>"With the success of that Quest Oswald will be one step closer to aquiring the needed sacred Hallows to heal the wasteland, and set to rights the grievous wrongs which plague the land from the south."<br/><br/>The Hero's Journey is about the Quest for Sovereignty.   Its rooted in the patterns of Celtic Mythology (deeper roots doubtless go back into Indo-European as there are many parallels, but I'm researching Celtic at this point).  In this example what you see are elements of the mythological pattern being revealed as elements of Roland's Quest on behalf of Oswald, who is seeking to maintain Sovereignty.   I see now that it would be unclear to someone who is not familiar with the symbolism of the Hallows Quests (the Mabinogion, Arthurian literature, etc).   But the symbolism that I'm working with here relates to that.   How the Astro-Tarot fits in is that each symbol is linked to a series of correspondences within my cosmological setting.   The Cards will help to show those relationships.   I'm working on the cards now.   I think it will probably be much clearer once the card and the book that will go with them are together, with some better examples than this one.   I should add that The Hero's Journey is only part of the Elthos game... an important part, but it spans a wider and deeper range of play than just a focus on that alone.   The Meta-System, which the Astro-Tarot deck is a part of, is designed to facilitate two elements of the game - the World Weaving / Campaign Design Phase (which is what I'm giving an example of in this post), and the more intereactive In-Play aspect which I'm currently working on refining and documenting.   But I also have other fish that are in the kettle so it may be a while before I get back to this element of the game.   It wasn't my intention when I came in to actually discuss this aspect ... I'm really not yet up to it as parts of it are still being designed...<br/><br/>Actually, my mission here today is really about play testing the ODS rules (my lightweight version of my larger Elthos rules system), so that I can begin the process of finishing my ODS rules for publication, on Rob and Luke's advice to "Get Stuff Out There".   Would you be able to help me with that aspect?   Do you know anyone in the New York area or a forum that might help with that?   That would be great!

No, that doesn't really answer my question - I am looking for more info as to what the players do, rather than more info about how the cosmology comes together. I mean, mythologies can interrelate all day, and it may or may not say anything about how the <i>game</i> works.

It helps to mimic actual "live" conditions where someone has gotten the game and doesn't have the designer around to explain stuff that might be vague in the rules.   I'm wondering if there's anything like a PlayTester's Pool where people sign up as PlayTester volunteers or anything like that?  If not, it could be a good thing to start maybe.   If I were to create something like that I would have volunteers who sign up register what types of games they're most interested in testing.  But maybe there's something already out there like that... do you know of anything like that by chance?   Or conversely, how would you go about getting your game out there to PlayTesters?
