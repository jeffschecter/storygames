Rudy and I really want to be in the same physical space when we filmed and we only had a window of few days when we was going to be possible. We spent the first couple of days filming experiments that were more, er, avant-garde, all of which were unqualified disasters. Finally, on the last day we settled for a standard talking head video, and we did a number of takes, of which the one we used was far and away the best.<br/><br/>That said, I do think we squeezed a lot of pertinent information into those 7 minutes, and even I'd make a couple of changes in retrospect, it does give you a solid idea why we're doing what we're doing.\n<blockquote>It looks good to me, all the information I'd want to know is pretty easy to find. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Chances are good I will be backing this when it goes live.</blockquote>\nAwesome!

Seriously, can you ask/test how many people can get through the entire 7 minutes ? I know I couldn't.<br/>Can you have some videos effects ? Can you clearly separate which parts of the video talks about what (the game, your company, why kickStarter). Maybe just use some labels at the bottom of the video.<br/>Also, this video should get me excited about the project. Could you check to do this :<br/>- have a three (max) minutes "teaser/trailer" video, giving an overall idea of the project, who you are, why kickStarter.<br/>- have other videos explaining the rules, answering some FAQ, even some play examples<br/><br/>Take a look at this : <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1956069330/teramyyd-earthsphere-0" rel="nofollow">teramyyd-earthsphere-0 on kickstarter</a><br/>a 90 seconds teaser video, and then, those ugly "learn more" video with guys sitting around a table below in the page (those videos are not in the "first fold" on the page).<br/><br/>Lastly, you need to represent your reward structure in the "center" of the page (then again, teramyyd-earthsphere, provides a good example), make it looks a little bit more "sexy".<br/><br/>I hope it helped ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whduryea" title="whduryea"><img alt="whduryea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/Nugan/noose755.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whduryea">whduryea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419137/#Comment_419137" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-28T11:52:54+00:00" title="July 28, 2013 11:52AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 28, 2013 11:54AM by whduryea.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Pells,<br/><br/>Thanks for the feedback.<br/><br/>We will be posting plenty of updates as the project evolves, but future videos of any kind are unlikely. I'd like to convey information in a way that highlights our strengths, not our weaknesses. Plus, there's the distance problem that I mentioned in my previous post. So, expect project updates to be text and/or pictures and not videos. \n<blockquote><br/>Lastly, you need to represent your reward structure in the "center" of the page (then again, teramyyd-earthsphere, provides a good example), make it looks a little bit more "sexy".<br/></blockquote>\nCan I get anyone else to weigh in on this? Given that we have a pretty basic reward structure ($15 gets you a PDF, $35 gets you the book + PDF, and all the rest is bonus content), I'm wondering if adding it to the body of the kickstarter will make it easier for potential backers to decide whether or not they want to pledge or if it will just add more clutter to the page. <br/><br/>I know I sometimes find that kickstarter pages are so packed with detail that it's difficult for me to find the basic info that I want to know quickly.  I wanted something concise and easy to navigate. But this is definitely an edit that we could make if it would make the project more friendly to potential backers.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kaser" title="kaser"><img alt="kaser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/686/nMCJHMAE3CEJS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kaser">kaser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419138/#Comment_419138" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-28T12:28:40+00:00" title="July 28, 2013 12:28PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The rewards are simple and clear to me.

Now, you may call your games misery tourism, but I think we have differing definitions. I equate misery tourism with people who are embattled. For example, the slaves in <i>Steal Away Jordan</i> ( <a href="http://rpgpundit.xanga.com/732669775/item/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://rpgpundit.xanga.com/732669775/item/</a> ) or the former prostitutes in my own <i>Terribly Beautiful</i> ( <a href="http://rpgpundit.xanga.com/671128705/item/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://rpgpundit.xanga.com/671128705/item/</a> ). Stumbling into embattled situations doesn't count.<br/><br/>You're writing, in most of your games, about regular people doing battle like heroes against typical enemies. Occasionally they're already heroes. This is not misery tourism, not by a long shot. To get misery tourism you have to create a game that attempts to evoke empathy for the downtrodden before play starts. What happens after play starts may vary from game to game. It's usually something uplifting (e.g. the legacies that outlive the characters in <i>Terribly Beautiful</i>). It might just be an exploration of suffering without purpose, not that I've ever seen such a game.<br/><br/>So, I'm going to go out on a limb here and write that your games may look, at first glance, like RPGPundit's attempts at misery tourism, but they don't fully grasp the concept. Secondly, I suspect that RPGPundit is playing a prank here, or at least getting in a good laugh. This is just plays into his hands all too well, and it runs off his rantings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419974/#Comment_419974" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-13T07:31:47+00:00" title="August 13, 2013  7:31AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're using the likeness of an actual suffering person to sell games?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whduryea" title="whduryea"><img alt="whduryea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/Nugan/noose755.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whduryea">whduryea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420247/#Comment_420247" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-17T09:20:34+00:00" title="August 17, 2013  9:20AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2013 9:28AM by whduryea.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm reminded of a series of posts by RPGPundit.

In fact, the games that deal most directly with heroism--<i>student/ZOMBIE</i> and <i>The Oldest, Cruelest Sword</i>--are pretty savage attacks on the concept, and the few real heroes in these games, like the <i>passe blanc</i>, don't get t perform any grand heroic acts, but instead show their heroism just by surviving in worlds that are openly hostile to them. \n<blockquote>To get misery tourism you have to create a game that attempts to evoke empathy for the downtrodden before play starts.</blockquote>\n<br/>If your players are already experiencing what you want them to experience before play starts and the game just feeds their expectations and confirms their perspective, then what good is it? The goal here is to alter perspectives through play, or to at least push the players into alien territory. <br/>\n<blockquote>So, I'm going to go out on a limb here and write that your games may look, at first glance, like RPGPundit's attempts at misery tourism, but they don't fully grasp the concept. Secondly, I suspect that RPGPundit is playing a prank here, or at least getting in a good laugh. This is just plays into his hands all too well, and it runs off his rantings.</blockquote>\nI'm not sure that the RPG Pundit even knows that these games exist, but his posse over at TheRPGSite are <a href="www.therpgsite.com/showthread.php?t=22390" rel="nofollow">as hostile to this project as you might expect</a>.\n<blockquote>You're using the likeness of an actual suffering person to sell games?</blockquote>\nI'm not sure what more I can say about the logo beyond what I said in the Jinx Strange interview. <br/><br/>Jinx actually edited my response to that question a bit, probably to make it more concise.<br/><br/>Here's my full original response:\n<blockquote>God, that photograph. What's truly horrifying about it is how human the vulture looks, and how inhuman the child looks. The child is hunched over and twisted up. Its face is covered. It looks almost like a beetle. You know it's a person\u2014a person who suffered more than you can imagine\u2014but its humanity doesn't register right away. Meanwhile, the vulture almost seems to have a human expression. You can almost see calculation and intelligence in its features.<br/><br/>We asked the artist who designed the logo, Amelia Cottle, to emphasize that dichotomy, to make the vultures look almost like cartoon characters, basically, because we wanted people who saw it to think, \u201cWow, those vultures look like people and that kid doesn't.\u201d<br/><br/>I think it's a metaphor that says a lot about what our games are doing. They're about how easy it can be to be the vulture, to emphasize with the vulture, and miss the human.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whduryea" title="whduryea"><img alt="whduryea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/Nugan/noose755.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whduryea">whduryea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420959/#Comment_420959" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-01T17:48:02+00:00" title="September  1, 2013  5:48PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And we're funded!
