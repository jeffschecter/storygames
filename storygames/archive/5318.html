Most of my exposure (until now) has been with the Tom Baker and Peter Davison varieties (Fifth and Sixth). I still consider Tom Baker to be \u2018The\u2019 Doctor, but David Tennant (the current, or Tenth Doctor) is by far my favorite. Tennant brings the vital energy and the darkness of The Doctor into full relief. Christopher Eccleston could have captured my heart completely on these matters, but his choice to leave after the first season diminishes him somewhat for me.<br/><br/>Anywho, the new Who series have completely transformed me into a Whovian, a Whoite \u2026 whatever.<br/><br/>So I\u2019ve gotten to wondering how you could (with reasonable fidelity) make a Doctor Who RPG. Mind you, there\u2019s already been one, but even by my very loose grading standards for mid-80s RPGs, it\u2019s a stinker.<br/><br/>After watching several episodes in a row, here\u2019s my take on the design-influencing factors that make a Who RPG difficult or mechanically different:<br/><br/>* There\u2019s only one Doctor. Trials on Gallifrey aside, there\u2019s really only one Doctor, and having everyone play a Time Lord would be interesting, but ultimately pointless. (Also, in the current series, the Doctor is the Last of the Time Lords, an idea I think is a good one, and which has shaped his persona immensely.) So the PCs in the game are much more likely to be Companions or other supporting characters.<br/><br/>* The Doctor has (essentially) infinite knowledge. While the Doctor may take some time (the first 15-20 minutes of the episode, generally) to figure out what is going on, once he does figure it out he knows precisely what they\u2019re dealing with. In other words, there\u2019s no alien race that the Doctor doesn\u2019t know at least a little about, no place that he can\u2019t at least pin on a map, or a historical moment (past or future) that he can\u2019t describe and provide context for.<br/><br/>* The Doctor always has a plan. What that plan is and how it falls together is often surprising and ingenious, but is usually inscrutible to the rest of us.<br/><br/>* A Who game is a time-travel game. Time travel\u2019s a bitch even in regular old fiction like the TV show - let\u2019s not even talk about the difficulties in making a time-travel RPG.<br/><br/>Here are some basic mechanics that I\u2019m considering:<br/><br/>* The Doctor is an eNPC (Ensemble Non-Player Character). I\u2019ve talked about this before, if you want to check into it. The upshot is: The players all spend some sort of resource to manipulate the Doctor in some way. They can use him to \u2018make up\u2019 facts about the problem at hand, such as \u201cOh, that\u2019s strange - you\u2019re full of pluton particles! I haven\u2019t seen them since the 23rd Empire!\u201d This takes care of the infinite knowledge, plus how to play the Doctor without having him be a GM-puppet.<br/><br/>* In order to get more resources, the character have to put themselves in jeopardy or take on risks. They get themselves kidnapped, and bargain with dire results in order to give themselves more influence over the Doctor, or save up resources for some gambit. This mimics the general pattern of the show.<br/><br/>* Contingent on the risk is some sort part of the solution to their own jeopardy, which then contributes resources to the overall problem/story arc. In other words, their dilemmas must somehow tie back to the main story, and the resolution of their own jeopardies contributes resources back to the Doctor\u2019s solution to the overall crisis. This takes care of the \u2018Doctor has a plan\u2019 issue.<br/><br/>* I can\u2019t think of anything \u2019soft\u2019 to resolve the time-travel issue. Obviously, there are rules that the Doctor adheres to: No mucking about with \u2018established historical events\u2019 (a phrase I heard in a recent show), no messing with an individual\u2019s personal timeline, no paradoxes. These rules would have to be hard-coded into the rules somehow, and would basically constitute limits on what the solutions that the players come up with may entail. Break the rules and you increase the complexity of the problem, leading to more work to be done.  What I'm thinking of is some sort of 'Timelord Ethos' that would act as an outside agent of influence on the Doctor, generating a score that the characters would have to overcome in order to get the Doctor to act in certain ways - or even a 'Doctor's Personality' score.<br/><br/>And that\u2019s all I have so far. I have so many ideas floating around right now that I don\u2019t think I can do anything about this, even in a free-and-under-the-table sort of way. So have at it, story-gamers.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119593/#Comment_119593" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-15T05:45:44+00:00" title="January 15, 2008  5:45AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First thing, there have actually been two different Who RPGs published to date.

It's a massive improvement over the FASA one (which is probably the one you're thinking of).<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, you do know that Cubicle 7 are releasing a new Who RPG later this year.

(Because there's also the option of having a game that's set in the Doctor Who universe, but doesn't follow that format. Say, a game in which the PCs are members of UNIT or Torchwood or some similar organization. That's a different matter, though.)<br/><br/>2) The Doctor isn't <i>really</i> better than the Companions. Yes, he's far advanced when it comes to science, but if you watch the show, most of that is just color attached to conflicts the Doctor is resolving. Since most of the "science" isn't really science at all, I don't think it's important that a Time Lord's abilities actually reflect any real advanced knowledge. When it comes to the physical stuff, the Doctor is pretty much as vulnerable as any Companion to physical danger, and no more apt at fighting (and often <i>less</i> apt).  What the Doctor has more of than anyone else is charm, chutzpah, and force of personality, as well as the ability to pull plot twists out of his back pocket ("Oh, yes, I knew all of this was going to go down, and I've planned for it. Surprise!" Or, "I'm making this up as I go along, but I'm brilliant at it! Here's what we'll do...")<br/><br/>3) The Companions are good at: getting into trouble, uncovering clues that the Doctor can use to solve everything, making connections to characters in the story location. They're not stupider than the Doctor, they just don't have access to the same knowledge. They're not weaker than the Doctor, they just can't regenerate. (But I can count the number of Companions who have died on one hand, and still have fingers left over for dipping in jam jars. Death shouldn't really that much of an issue for PCs.)<br/><br/>4) Time travel in Doctor Who is generally just the way the PCs get from adventure to adventure, like Dogs traveling from town to town. A few stories aside ("Father's Day," "The Girl in the Fireplace," "Blink," a handful more), once the Doctor and Companions are somewhere, time travel in the Bill &amp; Ted/Continuum sense doesn't really happen. In one story, the Doctor will swear up and down that you can't mess with history, and in the next story, the very fabric of time is in danger because of people mucking about with history. So, I wouldn't stress about rules for wonky time travel things. Wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey. It's more of a story thing than a mechanics thing.<br/><br/>5) I'm thinking the Time Lord character would be different from Companions because of the ability to Make Shit Up. Pseudoscience, technobabble, setting color, and plot twists. This could either be reflected in abilities that the player rolls (or plays cards or whatever) for, or it could be Story Points.<br/><br/>6) Companion characters would be different from the Time Lord because of the ability to quickly have relationships with NPCs and the ability to produce Bits that the Time Lord can use. Hmmmm. How about this: When Companions are successful in conflicts (which could even result in the Companion dying or being otherwise indisposed), they are rewarded with Story Points or Bonus Dice--which they cannot spend. Companions have to give the Time Lord the Story Points or Bonus Dice (through sacrifice maybe?), which the Time Lord can spend to Make Shit Up--and resolve the really big conflicts.<br/><br/>(I'm totally pulling these mechanics ideas out of my ass. I have no idea how well they'd really work in play.)                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119625/#Comment_119625" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-15T07:31:17+00:00" title="January 15, 2008  7:31AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The main thing that strikes me that neither of the previous two games even attempted to get right was that this is not a game for eight players.

Having one player play the Doctor all the time strikes me as troublesome. So innovate out of that paradigm<br/>\n<br/>\n1. One person plays the Doctor. However, sometimes the Doctor is super important to the story and he's the protagonist. Other times he's totally not, he just happens to interact with the characters that actually matter (Thing about Sally Sparrow in Blink - totally she's the protagonist. Same for Elton in Love and Monsters. Arguably in some episodes the main companions are the protagonists either in addition to or instead of the Doctor - this varies a lot from episode to episode) In other words, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=337" rel="nofollow">play it exactly like how Vincent Baker suggests you play Conan</a> for In A Wicked Age.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, several things about In A Wicked Age work well for Doctor Who. You have an in built excuse for chapter breaks (the chapter ends when the Doctor leaves in his TARDIS), the oracle drawing would describe the nature of the timeline, you could happily have people playing transient characters who stay for just the episode, and characters who are picked up in one episode and recur for a bit (like Adam in the first of the new series, the guy with the chip in his head), you can have people that recur but aren't continually in it (Mickey, Rose and Martha's families), and you can have the companions. (Probably the companions should go on the We Owe list every time they get captured. It would explain why it happens so freaking often.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe recurring villains (Master, notable Daleks) and monsters-of-the-week would be the domain of the GM.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it works.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. The Doctor is a rotating role, and here tends to be the protagonist more often (if not all the time). Your time as the Doctor is the equivalent of your time in the spotlight episode in PrimeTime Adventures.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could combine this with everything above, for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. The doctor is played as a gestalt entity, with people using him as a mechanic through which things happen. This is an interesting approach, potentially the most innovative.

Yes, he's far advanced when it comes to science, but if you watch the show, most of that is just color attached to conflicts the Doctor is resolving. Since most of the "science" isn't really science at all, I don't think it's important that a Time Lord's abilities actually reflect any real advanced knowledge. When it comes to the physical stuff, the Doctor is pretty much as vulnerable as any Companion to physical danger, and no more apt at fighting (and often<i>less</i>apt).  What the Doctor has more of than anyone else is charm, chutzpah, and force of personality, as well as the ability to pull plot twists out of his back pocket ("Oh, yes, I knew all of this was going to go down, and I've planned for it. Surprise!" Or, "I'm making this up as I go along, but I'm brilliant at it! Here's what we'll do...")</blockquote>\nThe Doctor (at the very least) has physical tolerances far beyond normal humans.  And while the stuff that comes out during the course of the episode is usually color - it's color with consequence.  What I'm talking about with the eNPC idea is the ability to generate 'color that matters', if you will.  The Doctor comes out with some piece of alien knowledge, and that comes bundled with both consequences for the story ("Here's how the problem-du-jour is going to evolve or complicate.") and pathways for solution.  It's not situation creation - that could at least initially be handled by a DitV-type mechanic - but complication creation that doesn't rely on some scripted scenes or a concrete solution.\n<blockquote>5) I'm thinking the Time Lord character would be different from Companions because of the ability to Make Shit Up. Pseudoscience, technobabble, setting color, and plot twists. This could either be reflected in abilities that the player rolls (or plays cards or whatever) for, or it could be Story Points.</blockquote>\nThe only problem that I have with this is that it places the burden of the story on the Timelord player - that player has to make the plot twists work, the technobabble hold together.  In other words, provide the color, but not provide too much detail about the color that it starts showing contradictions.  I understand that contradictions in canon are <i>de rigeur</i> with the series, but they at least hold within a given episode.  Breaking <i>that</i> level of consistency could be a deal-breaker.  And that's a lot of stuff to put on one player - and putting it in the hands of a GM is, um, boring.\n<blockquote>6) Companion characters would be different from the Time Lord because of the ability to quickly have relationships with NPCs and the ability to produce Bits that the Time Lord can use. Hmmmm. How about this: When Companions are successful in conflicts (which could even result in the Companion dying or being otherwise indisposed), they are rewarded with Story Points or Bonus Dice--which they cannot spend. Companions have to give the Time Lord the Story Points or Bonus Dice (through sacrifice maybe?), which the Time Lord can spend to Make Shit Up--and resolve the really big conflicts.<br><br>(I'm totally pulling these mechanics ideas out of my ass. I have no idea how well they'd really work in play.)</br></br></blockquote>\nThat's pretty much exactly what I'm talking about, only the Doctor isn't played by a single person, he's played by everyone in conjunction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kuma" title="Kuma"><img alt="Kuma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/010/nUOBV5SCXNNTN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kuma">Kuma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119751/#Comment_119751" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-15T17:25:51+00:00" title="January 15, 2008  5:25PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RichD</cite>I had always planned to do it as a DitV hack since going from place to place, discovering what the problems are, and putting them right as you see fit certainly sounds like Doctor Who to me.

Does everyone just pretend to ignore the fact that the Doctor as played by Bill in this week's session is not much like the Doctor that Frank played in last week's game?  Does Bill even make an attempt to play the Doctor the same way that Frank played him last week?  Do you accumulate notes for how the Doctor "should" be played?  And if you do, what happens when Jeff ignores those notes next session and does something else with the character?  For that matter, what if everyone agrees that Jeff fucking sucks as the Doctor and that he ruins every scene he's in -- is there a polite way to say "this character will rotate among the players in order, skipping over Jeff, because Jeff can't play it right"?  Or if Bill's only okay as the Doctor but TOTALLY AWESOME as a particular companion, should he really ever be handed the sonic screwdriver when he could be making the game five billion times better by playing that companion instead?<br/><br/><br/>Personally, I'm reluctant to even suggest any game for our group that features rotating PCs or gestalt characters, because the one thing that everyone in our group seems to love is playing <i>their character</i>.  We can pick up an NPC for a scene here or there and make it work, but there's a palpable sense of relief when everyone flips back to their "actual" character sheet.  Hell, <i>I</i> like owning my own PC, and feel a definite sense of revulsion at the idea of someone else sharing it or taking it over periodically.  But I'm also aware that I really don't have any idea what I'm talking about here, because I've never done it or seen it done, and so I need more information.<br/><br/>Knowing the ins and outs of this whole rotating-or-gestalt-character idea, as well as its most common problems/drawbacks and what it offers that can take the place of what our group already enjoys....well, I'm curious, and I want to hear more about that.  I can't even imagine what a game without traditional character ownership actually looks like from week to week, which means a lot of the discussion in this thread has me utterly mystified.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/despair" title="despair"><img alt="despair" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/despair">despair</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119791/#Comment_119791" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-15T22:53:47+00:00" title="January 15, 2008 10:53PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just my thoughts on the the "gestalt" character thing....and I will say that I have not done this myself among any gaming group I have been in so I may be speaking out my ass right now but...... <br/>\n<br/>\nIn a Doctor Who game if you are playing the current incarnation in which the Doctor is the "only" remaining timelord - having multiple timlords in the game does not make much sense....<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso having been in a media derived game ( one based on Zeta Gundam )  set during the series the PC 's were sort of second fiddles to the series characters and were pertty much acting that way till the GM killed the protagonist and antagonist of the series.....this forced the players to drive the story and bring the crazy awesome to the game.....<br/>\n<br/>\nSo .... going from that I just think it would be pretty cool to have a game mechanic that allowed all the players to have a go at playing the Doctor maybe in the IaWA sort of style or possibly in a way like Galactic in which all the players get a go at being the doctor in a different incarnation with the other players as his companions and one or all players taking turns at being the GM....<br/>\n<br/>\nHmmmmmm.<br/>\n<br/>\nG                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119797/#Comment_119797" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-16T01:56:09+00:00" title="January 16, 2008  1:56AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the problems that you can have if you get too hung-up on what The Doctor can and cannot do is the old Marvel Superheroes chestnut of The Sub Mariner.<br/>\n<br/>\nWaaaaay back when Subby first came out he could mimic the abilities of fish and other undersea creatures. In one issue he mimiced the power of the electric eel and zapped someone with a bolt of electricity. I'm not 100% sure but I have never seen him do it again. Now, in comics you can sometimes do that stuff and people let it pass. However in a game that means that Namor has a solid ranged energy attack and you damned well know that a proportion of players are not going to let that little tactical advantage slide! Suddenly, using precedent and a large encyclopedia of marine animals, the character is changed completely because of that one little quirk into being more like Animal Man.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same could happen with Dr Who. In 'The Runaway Bride', the Doctor clear has a 'fightin' hand' and is pretty good with a sword. Now that doesn't mean that he carries a sabre with him all of the time and shivs the bad guy at the first chance - but if you concentrate on that one aspect, thats what some players would do...<br/>\n<br/>\nOne idea I had about the perennial 'monster of the week' and the Doctor's ability to know about them an awful lot would be to have the monsters start as a blank template with no real details and each time the GM creates a detail, the Doctor (or Time Agent or Immortal Torchwood Operative - you choose) can add one more.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, for example:<br/>\n<br/>\nGM: Before you is a shivering, shuffling, vaguely humanoid shape. It groans and moans as it moves towards you, reeking of decay and death. Three green eyes stare out from deep wells in its face and it raises a viscious claw menacingly.<br/>\nDr: So it has a big nasty claw yeah?<br/>\nGM: Yeah - thats my first Monster Point. Big Nasty Serrated Claw<br/>\nDr: OK, I turn to my feisty female companion - "Don't let the shambling fool you - thats a X'ta Servitor - it smells through that claw. Once it smells blood it stops being all George Romero and starts with the 28 Days Later - RUN!!"<br/>\nGM: So, it smells through its claw and it animates when it pursues blood? Thats two excellent Monster Points - but it leave me with one to allocate. I'll save that.<br/>\nDr: Sorry, can't hear you, running!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nEtc.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kuma" title="Kuma"><img alt="Kuma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/010/nUOBV5SCXNNTN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kuma">Kuma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119804/#Comment_119804" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-16T03:29:35+00:00" title="January 16, 2008  3:29AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 16, 2008 3:30AM by Kuma.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I noticed I forgot (or lost) the link to the original eNPC post I made on my blog.  <a href="http://blog.kumapageworks.org/blog/?p=64" rel="nofollow">Here it is.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/despair" title="despair"><img alt="despair" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/despair">despair</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119828/#Comment_119828" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-16T06:27:35+00:00" title="January 16, 2008  6:27AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: vodkashokOne idea I had about the perennial 'monster of the week' and the Doctor's ability to know about them an awful lot would be to have the monsters start as a blank template with no real details and each time the GM creates a detail, the Doctor (or Time Agent or Immortal Torchwood Operative -

I can definitely see how the game could be used to play Doctor Who type stories, but they would then be told more in the vein of the Doctor and his companions chatting about the stories after the fact, as the game is played entirely in past tense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

But, I think, in the sense that myth-making is part of the fun of Dr. Who, that no one should play the doctor.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike many of these posting folks, I've been a Whovian for years. Owned the T-Shirts, wore the giant Tom Baker scarf in Junior High, got the pressure-sensitive color-changing mood button from the fan club, etc.  I've owned and played the Virgin game and the FASA game and I'll be picking up the new one although, God Help Me, I doubt I'll ever play it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I really, REALLY like the idea of making the Doctor a kind of... floating help machine. You and the other players stumble around with him in whatever part of time and space he's messing with and Find Things Out, Get Menaced by Monsters, Trigger Events and otherwise push the story along and then you summon up the Doctor to solve the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes, if you build up enough points or cards or momentum or whatever, you can solve the problems yourself, but you can always default to screaming (or whatever) to get the Doctor there and saving your butt in a hurry.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe there could be some mechanic like: too many people summon the Doctor's aid at once and he gets captured or risks regenerating or something (one regeneration per game, perhaps.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOther penalties might be getting dropped off at home (and left there) - dying (companions die every now and then) - going crazy, getting turned into a slug, gosh, the possibilities are endless.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if you want to ADD players, you could put out slots for temporary companions and allies from the local era.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, yeah, that's nifty. No One should play the doctor... especially if they're gonna play him as a bearded guy with a freakin' cat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121811/#Comment_121811" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T21:11:00+00:00" title="January 24, 2008  9:11PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Er... sorry to double post, but that bit about not playing the Doctor goes double for the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
