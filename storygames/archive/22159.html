                    My preliminary hypothesis, based on commonalities I see between <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/486311/#Comment_486311" rel="nofollow">my mirror story</a> and <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/486144/#Comment_486144" rel="nofollow">Sandra's</a>, which are pretty unlike.<br/><br/>1. The more unshared true knowledge in your game, the more real your game can be. This means that...<br/><br/>2. One way to make your game more real is to ask your fellow players not to share what they know with you. This is fun, but it can't work by itself, because first...<br/><br/>3. You need enough ambiguity between the fictional events of your game and the players' expectations of them to allow the players to develop different interpretations, different working knowledge, not of the fictional events themselves, but of the implicit fictional cause-and-effect principles underlying them. And for best results...<br/><br/>4. You should create ambiguities between the fictional events of your game and <i>your own</i> expectations of them, in any way you can, as player or as GM, as well as accepting ambiguity as others create it, and you should allow ambiguities to accumulate instead of trying to resolve them, until you have no choice but to interpret them instead of understanding them. But to make THIS work...<br/><br/>5. You need game systems that are sufficiently opaque, sufficiently rigorous, don't invite routine challenges to their results, don't reward mechanical efforts to resolve ambiguities, and expect or demand you to go along with them anyway. Sandra's blorb principles provide one approach to such a system, prep-oriented; Meg's, Emily's and my freeform game provides another, canon-oriented; and my game, The Wizard's Grimoire, despite my having downplayed it before now, provides a prospective third, opacity-oriented.<br/><br/>There are surely any number more approaches, and any number of games that provide examples for these three approaches, but still, few roads lead here. Most approaches to games, and most example games, don't.<br/><br/>So that's my preliminary hypothesis. Here's its first test.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Sandra">@Sandra</a>, here I'm considering your principles to do these following crucial functions (non-exhaustive):
<ul><li><b>Create rigor in your game systems.</b> For example, as GM, you don't routinely ignore die rolls or overwrite your prep just because you had an idea at the moment.</li>
<li><b>Minimize routine challenges to fictional events on the players' parts.</b> For example, as a player, I don't shout out what I think should be behind the door or routinely ask for a different ruling when I don't prefer the one you've made.</li>
<li><b>Create opacity, space, between players' expectations and the real fictional events of play.</b> For example, as a player, I should expect things to happen that I didn't expect and don't immediately understand, and when they do happen, I should accept that they have happened, even if they don't (yet) make any dang sense to me. It's uncool of me to routinely demand to understand why something happened before I'll accept that yes, it happened.</li>
<li><b>Provide no mechanisms by which players can assert their own opinions directly into the fictional cause and effect of the game.</b> For instance, no "give your explanation for what's going on, and on a 10+, you're right." Not even any "ask the GM what's going on, and on a 10+, she has to tell you," except conceivably under very strict limitations.</li></ul>
My questions for you! I'm not asking you to confirm or refute or even address my hypothesis in whole yet, it's way too baby for that. Just a couple of preliminary questions.<br/><br/>1. Are there any of these crucial functions that you'd say that no, in fact, your principles DON'T do?<br/><br/>2. I'm calling them "crucial functions," but are there any of them that you'd say that you could freely do away with, and still have blorb? (For instance, blorb doesn't need rigor in your game system, or blorb can tolerate routine challenges to fictional events.)<br/><br/>3. Do you see how Meg's, Emily's and my principles of radically co-GMed, live-negotiated play did these same crucial functions for us, despite running basically completely counter to your principles?<br/><br/>Whew.<br/><br/>Sandra, you've torn the roof off of my brain. I hope you can forgive me some thrashing and flailing!<br/><br/>-Vincent                </div>

                            Aha, yeah, so. Just like you and I must sometimes interpret why something happened in the real world, instead of knowing, ambiguous fictional cause-and-effect allows you and me to interpret why something fictional happened in the game, instead of knowing.<br/><br/>I'm talking about, like, we both agree that there's a bridge over the river here, with a big pylon holding it up, no problem. But I think that the big pylon probably means that it's leftover from the fantasy-Romans, and you think that maybe it is, but more likely it's newer. The GM's perfectly happy to describe the bridge in as much detail as we require, as long as we take the time to hang out and examine it, but neither of us are entitled to a definitive answer.<br/><br/>This is sort of, to me, a minimum ambiguity: the GM knows the answer, but isn't required to tell us outright. We can do our own work and come to our own conclusions. The game allows us to be right, to be wrong, and/or to disagree.<br/><br/>Traditionally, people have interpreted this ambiguity from the point of view of the GM's authority and ownership of the game world, but my mirror story points to the ambiguity itself as the crucial point. In a co-GMed game, ambiguity like this can exist between the GMs, and can increase the game's sense of reality there too!                        </div>

                            I have a question:<br/><br/>Would this ambiguity enhance the sense of reality if it extended to the GM himself? To build on the example you give, let's say the GM doesn't know either the true nature of the pylon. He has the description of the pylon and its effects, and has decided how likely it is that it's Roman instead of newer (let's say 1-5 in a d6 that it's Roman). He'll hold off rolling until the last possible moment, so, in a sense, it's a surprise for him too.                         </div>

                            Interesting.  In the context of a single-GMed "exploration and discovery" adventure RPG, all of the above reads to me as, "Well, yeah, of course."  Reality-ambiguity-interpretation is a big chunk of what <a href="/forums/profile/contracycle">@contracycle</a> and I used to ramble about a few years back.  But it is neat to see it spelled out this way and noted that it doesn't actually require the single GM.<br/><br/>I could blather at length about how Delve goes about all of those things if you want, Vincent.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  It's pretty close to the traditional thing you describe, but I'd say it's more about GM knowledge and limited communication rather than authority and ownership.  For now I'll assume that it's best that I hang back and let you and Sandra rock out.                        </div>

                            On the social level, I see it as a gesture from the GM that there is some authority bigger than themself. Maybe there's more to it, but at least that : getting out of the way for the players to have a direct relation to the object they interact with. It follows that the symmetry is also in the format of Q and A as exact reactions to the payers actions. But, a word about the terms, it's not "create opacity" or "create the unexpected" as much as "resist the urge to explain, give away or reassure with mechanical terminology". (This is typical of progressive education.)<br/><br/>The case of co-GMs is a special case, and doesn't follow strictly. If the bridge has a known history, the ambiguity is unwelcome. But maybe you mean something like Barthe's <i>punctum</i>. I'll explain it with a VR analogy : in a virtual environment created by computer, chances are the general apparence of things will be "filled with regularity". So your idea maybe to introduce something "out of the way", a grain of sand (the punctum) that catches the attention as un-inventable. Something like : "always mix your random tables fresh"                        </div>

                            I'm really glad to see this, Vincent! This is mental gears churning and new ways of looking at things being examined from a different angle, all thanks to Sandra's tireless efforts here on S-G as she explores and extends her particular playstyle. Fantastic!<br/><br/>I'm also really glad Dave showed up to mention Delve; I would be quite curious to see how you two see many of these features showing up in design and play in manners which aren't explained in the old-fashioned way ("the GM holds all the truths and keeps them secret!"). Vincent's new game is a very interesting example of this effect, to me, for that reason (since it breaks that paradigm and looks for new ways to create this effect).<br/><br/>I think Cary and Jay's "spicy dice" Middle Earth game is another interesting case to consider in the light of these ideas. I've been bringing it up a lot in these discussions, but no one's really engaged with that; looking at the game in the light of these concepts could be enlightening, as well.<br/><br/>More than anything, though, I'm looking forward to Sandra's take on all of this. My guess is that she will agree with some of it and disagree with other aspects, and I'm really excited and curious to see which and how.<br/><br/>Thank you for this lovely post!                        </div>

                            Hi Vincent,<br/><br/>Hope you've been well, it been years!<br/><br/>The game I've been playing in and posting about centralizes as a process of playy the last three of the four of your bullet points.  We players disambiguating (is that even really a word) based on the SIS and not on mechanics or DM fiating "truths" is core to our play style.  While you have stated your points very concisely and accessibly I have been discussing these point for a long time in a very abstracted way (Myth and bricolage and what not).  Thank you for doing what you do so well, making the complicated easy to understand.<br/><br/>The first bullet point would require some disambiguation for me to fully comment on but an argument could be made that it holds for my game depending on how one defines what prep includes or is about.<br/><br/>Interesting to see this convergent evolution of ideas.  It also helps to further understand what is going on in my game when useful new lenses become available.  Gives me hope.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

All but the first also seem goals of most traditional even vaguely immersive play. The first also seems to be the case for games like D&amp;D 3 and Pathfinder, at least to some extent.                        </div>

Bullet point 2 is vital and necessary for Bullet points 3 and 4 to function.  In such play the players have to understand that there will be ambiguity and disconnects and for this to work the players should not be in the habit of directly challenging or pre-empting the GM's input to the SIS when they (player and GM) are not in sync.<br/><br/>Just a thought.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Sandra">@Sandra</a>, awesome! I'll try to answer your questions soon.<br/><br/>I do see why the Seclusium moves didn't work for you, yeah, for sure.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Khimus">@Khimus</a>: For me, when I'm the GM and I realize that I don't know the answer, I have an important choice to make.<br/><br/>1. I can choose to <i>decide</i> the answer, maybe by weighing probabilities and rolling dice, or whatever, in which case I (fleetingly, it probably doesn't do any harm) set the project aside in order to get on with the project, if you see what I mean. Or else...<br/><br/>2. I can choose to <i>try to find out</i> the answer instead of deciding it, somehow. This means recommitting to the project, extending the project into this new space, and for real undertaking to find out information that isn't available to normal research. Or else...<br/><br/>3. I can acknowledge that I don't know the answer, and choose to accept that for now I don't know it, and maybe later I'll have to choose whether to decide it or discover it.<br/><br/>The first has the advantage of getting on with the project.<br/><br/>The second has the advantage of giving me strategies and practice I can use again, next time I need to research information that isn't available to research.<br/><br/>The third has the advantage of letting unknowns accumulate. I don't know in advance how those unknowns will connect with one another; I think of a body of unknowns as, like, fertile ground, the richer the better.                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/lumpley">@lumpley</a>:<br/>I imagine another option that might look like this: <br/><br/>I acknowledge I don't know x, and want to find it out at the same time the players do, as if my GM perspective into the setting and situation matched exactly the players' ones. I'll decide on a generation method, like drawing a card or rolling dice, and use it exactly when the players would find out the truth. For example, players lie to a police officer, but neither I nor them know if he bought it. I don't decide it at that instant either, but hold on until later, planning for a moment when the police officer could set them a trap or ambush them (for example, when the suspect is alone in the street). That's when I roll to determine if he believed them or not. This could be applied too to determine for example who's the murderer in an investigation, or the pylon origin.                        </div>

I'd contest that this would depend heavily on the genre and style of the game. In some genres, information given by the senses might not be very reliable, or causality of events might be at best remotely accessible to the characters. Even with all the information at hand and perfect deduction skills, the truth might be exactly the opposite.<br/><br/>In such a game, you'd want the situation to be as blurry as possible, to have players dealing constantly with uncertainty.                        </div>

                            Yeah, I know, but this topic is agnostic to blorb/unblorb (to me at least), and in my experience there are multiple techniques to make a game feel real.<br/>But even assuming it is a trip and not a story, there are different constructions for what "realness" is. I assume realness to be, at least to some extent, about living in uncertainty and committing to decisions without knowing it all.<br/><br/>I don't know, I might freak out during an excursion to the woods and start thinking somebody is following me. Can I trust my senses? What if I waste hours or energy trying to find a defensible position, but nothing shows up?<br/><br/>My proposition is that a GM might communicate better this uncertainty if he experiences it himself, if he doesn't know if there's or not a predator out there while he's describing the situation.                        </div>

This is why I defer to "the Spirit of the System," which differs from genre to genre and playstyle to playstyle, and plays a similar role in my approach to the one that the Gloracle plays in Sandra's.<br/><br/>That said, there are other differences between our approaches, such as the fact that in most games I don't distinguish between tiers of truth, except to blur them.  Some will see this as "Illusionism" but I would disagree, because I'm as bound to my data (which may be totally random, depending on the system) as the Players are.<br/><br/> </div>

                            Lumps, re those wand story Qs, I wasn't intending them rhetorically at the time (I was genuinely curious) but in hindsight if you want to interpret them as such and you see the full elucidation of wand story as distracting, I'm fine with tabling them as long as it was conveyed that I genuinely don't see how the wand story was doing them.<br/><br/>Not to throw shade at wand story but not to dig in too deeply on the data point of wand story if it ends up being dissimilar from blorb realness. Not saying it <i>is</i> dissimilar, I just don't currently see the similarity &amp; am freeing you from having to dig in to defend the similarity if you don't want to, or, don't want to in the context of <i>this</i> partic hypothesis &amp; experiment.<br/><br/>OTOH since it was you that brought wand story &amp; asked if I could grok the similarities, uh, I'm kinda starting to saw off my own branch here… Just tryna communicate re it.                        </div>

                            In the meantime I understood for myself what the "opacity" was for. It comes directly from the wand story. <br/><br/>I want to weed out a lexical theme from the initial post, that of "thickness". I don't think there needs to be a pile of "accumulating" stuff for the wand story to happen. More precisely, I don't think the number of unanswered assumptions make the object "thicker". <br/><br/>The illusion of a world doesn't come from their "stuff" (there's none), but from the high number of relations between objects, their networking. A McGuffin is typically very thin. A game like The box creates a very solid object with thin layers (appearances) and rootstock extensions (pointing at the characters). So I want to prevent a mistake : I don't believe making it about "thickness" is going to be useful. But networks of interactions, definitely.                         </div>

I agree that this 'networking' is important. A low number of connections to other content makes randomly generated content initially seem less real: When I generate random encounters for the Wilder lands I always think about their relationship to what's already there (e.g. bandits in a dragon's territory might pay tribute, worship it, live in fear etc.). I typically use reaction rolls for this. But that's still a far cry from the networking seen in some published modules, with factions, rivalries etc.                         </div>

                            I'll throw in another example, and I'd be curious to hear people's takes on this one:<br/><br/>Vincent and I have been discussing Dogs in the Vineyard a bit elsewhere, and so I've been thinking about how to create Relationships for the Dogs in the Towns they visit.<br/><br/>It seems to me that the exact way we get those connections to happen really affects how 'real' or how 'meaningful' they feel, and this has to do with distance (c.f. Sandra's "paper before rock" principle) as well as buy-in. The participants' ability to move things around and decide on the spot definitely affects how we feel about the fictional relationships we're describing.<br/><br/>I wrote about it over here:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/486548/#Comment_486548" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/486548/#Comment_486548</a><br/><br/>Each of these (in the link) definitely feel very different, even though in terms of who-gets-to-decide-what they're just reordering the steps in different ways, and getting those decisions to happen in different moments in the prep-play cycle.<br/><br/>My experience has been that the further down this list I go, the more "real", weighty and effective these Relationships are, in terms of how the players treat them.                        </div>

As a counter example, a game that depends very heavily on tier-two-truths compared to one that has a couple of tier-one things in there. That’s an axis that’s orthogonal to Jay’s astute theory on “she’s not there” / death of the DM. Because both tier 2 truths and tier 1 truths can be wholly gloracular. Is there a difference in solidity and “there”-ness in that regard? According to some of my players: yes.<br/><br/> </div>

This is what I would have said too - "maybe we were 100% and you weren't?" - before you said those three magic words!<br/><br/>But now you did say those three magic words to me, and I think that what made it happen was our incredibly rich canon offscreen gamestate.                        </div>

                            It seems <i>to me</i> that "solidity" is a feeling, i.e. subjective and internal rather than objectively observable, and that a worthwhile question would be "What contributes to the feeling of "solidity" for different people?"<br/><br/>The number of details and the number of connections would be one factor (though one we could certainly exclude from the current thread if that is perceived as derailing it), "opacity, space, between players' expectations and the real fictional events of play" would be another (and one that I haven't considered before and find very intriguing).<br/><br/>I'm not trying to change around definitons again but merely expressing my discomfort at the prospect of another discussion based on nebulous or potentially contentious terminology like "more real" in Vincent's initial post. I'd really appreciate some groundwork here (such as eventually provided by <a href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">@Thanuir</a> and others regarding gamestate).                        </div>

                            I think I understand what Sandra is going for there.<br/><br/>You can have something with lots of detail and lots of connections, right, but it’s still contrived and mutable and shifts around in response to the players’ actions (to give a few examples). <br/><br/>If it starts to be contingent on external factors, it loses some of that solidity.<br/><br/>That’s why she might have made Aviatrix roll for her character’s weight, let’say: because we’re pretending that it’s been that way all along, and we’re getting to *find out what it is*, rather than just being able to *make it up*. <br/><br/>In this way, the “reality” can push back against us: in this instance, it might say, “no, sorry, you are too heavy/too light for this thing you want to do.” Too bad for you! But no one decided that, right? It just happened to be that way.                        </div>

                            Of course, if you add "contingent", "mutable" "shifting" and "fickle" to what I said, you're going to get something not-solid. ;P<br/>I believe you guys have seen something that I haven't : it doesn't bother me.

<b>Preamble</b><br/><br/>First off, Sandra. I know I'm asking you to keep an open mind here. I'm asking you to entertain the idea that <i>the thing</i> in your mirror story, I recognize the same thing in my wand story, even though the stories seem super different. I know you don't recognize it in my wand story yet. My task is to reconcile our two stories so that they both make sense in the same terms, so that blorb, which gives you your experience, and ... uh ... garst, which gave me mine, while going about it in completely incompatible ways, do the same thing.<br/><br/>And I'll say that blorb's probably the better approach. I haven't played garst for a decade plus, because it's long and particular to set up. The commitments required aren't convenient for me to make right now. So my goal here isn't to supercede blorb, even though I'll talk a lot about contra-blorb techniques. They're, and I say it in informed seriousness, probably worse techniques.<br/><br/>And I'll reiterate that while I think that potentially there are several approaches to this - blorb, garst, possibly others represented here on SG, and also others yet unconsidered - most approaches to roleplaying do something else entirely. This isn't normal roleplaying, it's an outlier. This is what makes it useful for RPG theory, and efforts to redefine it into the mainstream are misconsidered.<br/><br/>And finally, this experience is irrational. I'm here looking at techniques we use to provoke ourselves into a social and psychological circumstance where we share an irrational experience with other people. I find value in this, in part because of its irrationality. Those of you who shy away from irrational ideas might want to sit this one out.<br/><br/><b>Diagrams</b><br/><br/>So this might be true:<br/><br/><b>Blorb vs Garst</b><br/><img alt="Equivalent, separate Blorb and Garst processes: Principles -&lt; Actions -&lt; The Game is Real -&lt; Interpretations" src="http://lumpley.com/images/blorbvsgarst.jpg"/><br/><br/>The realness that you experience via blorb might not be the realness that I experienced via garst at all. We have nothing to learn from each other, any effort to compare our dissimilar interpretations, principles, and actions to arrive at shared underlying processes is doomed. We don't, in fact, share underlying processes.<br/><br/>(This is where "what makes things feel solid for different people?" would take us, by the way.)<br/><br/>But I don't think this is true at all! I think that the truth is much weirder.<br/><br/>I think that the truth is:<br/><br/><b>Blorb <img alt="&lt;3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/heart.png" title="&lt;3"/> Garst</b><br/><img alt="Symmetrical Blorb and Garst processes, sharing The Game Can Seem Real and The Game is Real" src="http://lumpley.com/images/blorbplusgarst.jpg"/><br/><br/>I think that the realness that you experienced in your mirror story and the realness that I experienced in my wand story are the same realness, created by the same underlying processes (represented by "The Game Can Seem Real"), even though our interpretations, principles, and actions aren't compatible.<br/><br/><b>Am I right?</b><br/><br/>I don't know! I think I am. I'm asking you to entertain that I am.<br/><br/><b>"But what creates this?"</b><br/><br/>I've known one obvious crucial component of The Game Can Seem Real for a long time: a strong, shared commitment to treating imaginary things as real.<br/><br/>You've given me, now, a second crucial component: a robust canon offscreen gamestate.<br/><br/><b>Blorb <img alt="&lt;3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/heart.png" title="&lt;3"/> Garst</b><br/><img alt="Symmetrical Blorb and Garst processes, with Shared Commitment and Canon Offscreen Gamestate under The Game Can Seem Real" src="http://lumpley.com/images/blorbplusgarstcomponents.jpg"/><br/><br/>Now I can begin to answer your questions about my wand story, as soon as I'm able. It'll be another day or two!                        </div>

                            Yes. I'm not <i>ruling out</i> the idea that "wand story realness = mirror story realness". Just tryna communicate honestly &amp; completely, since this as an important part of the <del>flamewar</del> research we're conducting. From the way you described your wand story it did seem similar to things I've experienced before in our impromania.

I've been thinking about this one. Part of the way we create the buy-in is that I <i>can</i> sometimes <b>do</b> provide these explanations. The wolves are in the room because the prep says so, see here [shows prep, covers rest of page].<br/>The transparency of method.<br/>But.<br/>When someone is consistently questioning it it does become annoying. We play drop-in/drop-out so this guy isn't at every session, but it's frustrating to run for him. I think it's because instead of asking "what makes this real", he is asking it in a way that implies "this shouldn't be real, you have to change it". And I'm like, I can't change it. It's real.                        </div>

                            Questions and thoughts.<br/><br/>Mirrors: how is it decided that a new tier-2 random table is the right choice for the game-world? What if there is pushback? Can it be collaborative? Is the right approach "let one person recede from playing and enter patch-mode; they apply a patch and re-enter playing; now their patch is canon and has become the choice and we go with it; once everyone has receded after a session, if you think the patch-mode action was suboptimal feel free to discuss how patch-mode might be improved in the future".<br/><br/>Wands: when you discover a new fact that contradicts what you thought was true, is your procedure to dismiss your own thoughts, reject reality, inspect reality, or what? Does it depend?<br/><br/>Discover a new fact == someone says something. That's what it means to discover a new fact, because you are collectively trusting that you're all saying things from a very, very similar idea of the game world.<br/><br/>Contradicts what you thought was true == occasionally, you won't actually be on the same page, possibly because of something fundamental or possibly because you just never considered there might be raiders and they just never considered everyone has fled the area.<br/><br/>Dismiss your own: "oh not everyone fled, the raiders are here"<br/>Reject reality: "there aren't raiders, wonder why [they] said there were"<br/>Inspect reality: "say aloud 'if everyone fled, how are there raiders' or offer your own explanation proactively"                        </div>

I should have annotated:<br/><br/>Discover a new fact =<i>within garst</i>= someone says something, trusting, etc<br/><br/>because that's my read of garst from above. Completely different in blorb.                        </div>

                            It sure does need trust, and there sure does need to be preliminary work! In our case, most of a decade developing the canon, AND the specific way that we developed it, which cultivated each of us as independent authorities on it.<br/><br/>I can't tell you how much preliminary work went into it. It's not practical to reproduce like blorb is.<br/><br/>But I can try to tell you how it...
<ul><li><b>Created rigor in our game systems &amp; minimized routine challenges to fictional events on the players' parts:</b><br/>Because we were each independent authorities on both the game's canon and on what happened live in play, we couldn't dismiss each others' visions. Where blorb creates rigor and minimizes routine objections by establishing an unassailable GM - backed up by transparency when necessary - we did it by establishing that each of us were coequal authorities. Backed up by transparency when necessary!<br/><br/>If I were going to routinely challenge, say, Emily's fictional contributions, I shouldn't keep playing the game with her. If she were going to routinely challenge mine, she shouldn't keep playing the game with me.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Created opacity, space, between players' expectations and the real fictional events of play:</b><br/>We were <i>independent</i> authorities on the canon. We developed the canon over, like I say, most of a decade, and we did it in a number of different games, with a number of different groups of people.<br/><br/>When Meg, Emily and I sat down to play, our agreement was that (1) everything that had happened in those other games, had really happened. (2) Or maybe they hadn't <i>exactly</i>, but these were the stories that got spread around about them. (3) Whoever was there when it happened, we'd take their word for it. (4) Where our memories don't agree, that's okay, our memories don't agree. When did two people's memories ever agree?<br/><br/>We also assigned each other research areas. For instance, it was my job to find out everything I could about the rules and traditions of the Order of Hermes, so that we'd have an authority on the topic in the group. Meg and Emily would defer to me on those matters. It was my job to decide the canon in this case, right, but I knew from experience to preserve space for interpretation in "my" canon so that I could share authority when the time came. Emily's job was to know about the Mongol Invasion, which would come to threaten us in just a couple of years. Meg's job was to know about our clothing, medicine, and langauge.<br/><br/>Anyway, as a result, whenever Meg or Emily said anything about anything, I might be surprised by it. My expectations where never 100% correct, because they knew a whole lot of things that I just never knew.<br/><br/>All the way down to, when our characters would gossip with each other, ALL KINDS of wonderful tidbits would come out, details that one of us knew but the other didn't happen to know, glimpses of events that we could legitimately try to piece together into a whole, second-hand stories that really were second-hand, hazy memories of something that actually happened, all kinds.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Provided no mechanisms by which we could assert our own opinions directly into the fictional cause and effect of the game:</b><br/>For instance, there was this one minor character whom I believed to be gay, but Meg believed to be straight. Who was right? Our rules didn't let us resolve it purely as players, we couldn't just decide, we'd have to come up with a way to put it to the test. We'd have to follow this guy around like meddling busybodies until he got laid!<br/><br/>We had other things to do with our attention, so to this day none of us know who he was sleeping with, or whether he was celibate (which would surprise me, frankly), or what.</li></ul>
It's so hard to communicate clearly! I could write 100 pages and scratch the surface.<br/><br/>But garst, like I say, isn't what I'm pursuing here. What I'd like to pursue is the role of canon offscreen gamestate in creating the feeling of truth, of reality.<br/><br/>I really, honestly, truly believe that this one minor character in our game, I forget his name even, but he could have been sleeping with somebody without our knowing it. All of those minor characters had private lives that we didn't pry much into.<br/><br/>This is just a case of canon offscreen gamestate. A canon fact, in principle knowable, but as it happens known to none of us. I don't have any problem with that.<br/><br/>But my hypothesis is that the process of creating these unknown truths - or known but unshared truths, since to me the truths that Meg and Emily knew but I didn't are indistinguishable from the truths that none of us knew - is what GIVES a game this kind of irrational reality. Unproved, untested, but that's my hypothesis.<br/><br/>Uh. I have followup questions about blorb! This stuff is so difficult to talk about.                        </div>

                            Very cool techniques. <br/>I am always tempted by the rigor of "provid(ing) no mechanisms by which we (can) assert our own opinions directly into the fictional cause and effect of the game" Like in Nerver av Stal. It is the most nervously demanding, though.<br/><br/>The first two are, like, Dominions. For me, it's making part of the world a player character, only with no sentience, a "neutral" causality, at best a system. It comes easier  when you have a character to spout this lore through. Like good old princess prep, with no teeth but respect.                        </div>

                            Hi Vincent,<br/><br/>One of the reasons you might be having difficulties discussing your ideas is that is that much of what you've described has many parallels to myth.  Not myth of the Vikings or the Greeks but myth as constructed and lived by pre-literate tribal cultures.  The accumulation of the canon, the various authorities/sources, that growth of the myth (canon) is accomplished using existing structures and not player stated abstractions.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Play using existing structures would include</span> "following around" the PC to "see" what is learned even though you players are the creators <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is an example of that type of play</span>.<br/><br/>If this is the reason, as opposed to something like its very personal and difficult to share, then there is good reason for your difficulty in expressing yourself.  To outsiders such myth is extremely opaque and the process of its creation difficult to understand as there is no analogue to it western culture.  We really don't have a good vocabulary or idea scaffolding culturally to relate to it.  If you are the reading type you might want to read (or possibly reread as the case may be) <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=13560.0" rel="nofollow">this</a>, <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=10283.0" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=14371.0" rel="nofollow">this</a>.  Perhaps you might find a tool or two that you can find to help parse your thinking.  I hope it helps.  The path you're currently moving down very closely parallels the ideas wrestled with in those threads.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay<br/><br/>Edited to clarify an ambiguity.

<blockquote class="Quote">Where blorb creates rigor and minimizes routine objections by establishing an unassailable GM - backed up by transparency when necessary</blockquote>
This isn’t quite correct.<br/>The DM defers to the gloracle.<br/><br/>The <em>information separation itself</em> is what makes the players turn to the DM and ask.
<blockquote class="Quote">we did it by establishing that each of us were coequal authorities. Backed up by transparency when necessary!</blockquote>So “authority” is kind of a polysemic lexeme in this context. Even <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/authority" rel="nofollow">authority-3</a>, “a person accepted as a source of reliable information on a subject”, kinda conflates a person <em>relaying</em> information with a person <em>originating</em> information.<br/><br/>With the gloracle, the DM isn’t the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/source#Noun" rel="nofollow">source-2</a> (the originator), just a source-1 (the interface).
<blockquote class="Quote">If I were going to routinely challenge, say, Emily’s fictional contributions, I shouldn’t keep playing the game with her. If she were going to routinely challenge mine, she shouldn’t keep playing the game with me.</blockquote>(Warning: semantic nitpick on the phrase “fictional contribution” ahead)<br/><br/>And that’s what would keep happening to me until I stopped using fictional contributions <em>while running</em> games.<br/><br/>As a GM, I used to get challenged, overruled, ground to powder, not taken seriously.<br/><br/>As a player, I wouldn’t <em>really</em> care about what happened in the game since it was just a story, just make-believe.
<blockquote class="Quote">It was my job to decide the canon in [the case of the Order of Hermes], right, but I knew from experience to preserve space for interpretation in “my” canon so that I could share authority when the time came.</blockquote><small>This opacity/space point is good, not challenging it as a whole, just unsure about a detail:</small><br/>How does that space-reservation work? And, what kind of “authority” is shared (a necessary question given the polysemic tangle surrounding that concept, see above).
<blockquote class="Quote">We had other things to do with our attention, so to this day none of us know who he was sleeping with, or whether he was celibate (which would surprise me, frankly), or what.</blockquote>In that case, <em>is</em> there even a true answer? It’s amazing, good, great, jolly, aces that you can’t mechanically assert/insert opinions. Decision-making thoroughly disclaimed — a cornerstone of blorb (translated into your familiar AW lingo, sorry if it sounds nerdy coming from me). But is there a true answer or is it a Schrödinger’s gaiety? If there is a true answer, it’s OK if the answer is un–find-out–able by <em>anyone</em> at the table. But this sounds like something that would sooner or later <strong>be</strong> find-out–able, if he were to sex it up with someone on-screen. Then someone would <em>have</em> to decide if he was MSM (though not necessarily gay) or MSW (though not necessarily straight).<br/><br/>I.o.w. his gaiety was an entity in the game state and while it’s blorby that there’s no mechanic for anyone to just insert&amp;assert this, it’s unblorby (but not necessarily ungarsty) that there isn’t a <abbr title="single point of truth">SPOT</abbr> for it.<br/><br/>Put another way; the point in contention is <strong>“Provided no mechanisms by which we could assert our own opinions directly into the fictional cause and effect of the game”</strong> and, well, in the situation that arose around this guy, it seems to me that the <em>only</em> way that you could resolve it would for one of you to assert his or her own opinion directly as fact.
<blockquote class="Quote">But garst, like I say, isn’t what I’m pursuing here.</blockquote>You are right. Let’s drop or postpone this subthread; put the questions I’ve posed above on hold. We need to investigate blorb, or not just blorb but off-screen canon game state in general, urgently.
<blockquote class="Quote">But my hypothesis is that the process of creating these unknown truths - or known but unshared truths, since to me the truths that Meg and Emily knew but I didn’t are indistinguishable from the truths that none of us knew - is what GIVES a game this kind of irrational reality.

Which is a <em>great</em> starting point for <del>flamewars</del> research!<br/><br/>My own preliminary, tentative hypothesis is that it’s related somehow, kinda, maybe to the make-believe symmetry. And that hypohesis would be either
<ol><li>falsified by garst, at least in my mind, if I could get on board with garst, or</li><li>not-falsified (but still not proven) by garst, if I change my view of garst as having the symmetry property from having the incompatible property of “one participant makes things up and the other accepts it as if it were fact”.</li></ol>But again, I’m more than happy to move on from garst &amp; put the garst stuff on hold!<br/><br/>Ask blorb Qs!<br/><br/> </div>

I think this a great - and very clear - formulation of what you're working with here, and how you're approaching it.<br/><br/>My own experience with the "unknown truth" of the "possible gay NPC" in a collaborative game of this has gone in one of two directions. I'll describe them briefly, and you'll have to tell me whether either is close to what you're thinking about here, or not.<br/><br/>1. We are playing together, and all making things up - as you do, in an RPG. However, we take turns and sometimes our contributions overlap and intertwine. Over time, no single person is "making up" enough things to feel like an author; the contributions of the other players take up enough space in what's being created that I can start to "feel" as though I'm exploring something real, even though I'm also making up pieces of it as we go. <br/><br/>In the context of this NPC, I'm really curious about him, and at some point another player says something which determines his nature, so I feel like I'm discovering it, even though it was actually my friend making it up. But we do it enough, back and forth, that none of us feel like we're making everything up as we go along.<br/><br/>There's a certain magic to "forgetting" that you're making contributions in a game like this, and picking your moments; over time, the contributions start to meld together and become hard to tell apart.<br/><br/>2. We are playing, as above, but none of us want to *decide* what the deal with this NPC is. Instead, we colour around the margins, leaving that space. However, at some point, we colour enough around this space that it becomes obvious that there is only one possible answer to the question.<br/><br/>Perhaps I describe him coming out of a certain house, and then you happen to remember that so-and-so lives at that house, and then a third person says that he's got a bit of a sly grin on his face - so uncharacteristically! - and... we think about it for a second, and then we all look at each other and we go, "Ohhhhhhh!" Now we know. We weren't planning to find out, no one was trying to decide, but suddenly there it is, clear as day.<br/><br/>Are either of those what you're talking about here?<br/><br/>Of course, Sandra gets at a similar point/question in a very clear way here, which I hope you will respond to (if you have some other thoughts on the matter):
<blockquote class="Quote"><br/>Put another way; the point in contention is <strong>“Provided no mechanisms by which we could assert our own opinions directly into the fictional cause and effect of the game”</strong> and, well, in the situation that arose around this guy, it seems to me that the <em>only</em> way that you could resolve it would for one of you to assert his or her own opinion directly as fact.<br/></blockquote>

First, what is your "preliminary, tentative hypothesis" here? Do you have a favourite formulation? How are you thinking of it now?<br/><br/>Similarly, what exactly is "make-believe symmetry", in that phrase above? It sounds pretty key, and I want to make sure I'm not projecting other meaning onto what you're writing.<br/> </div>

                            An example of the make-believe symmetry is that the mirror just <i>has</i> these specific set of properties, and that's the case for both the DM and the players.

The DM role and the player role has some important &amp; interesting differences but with make-believe symmetry we both need to relate to the make-believe material in the same way. It's has the same degree of realness on both sides of the screen, just not the same amount of information known.                        </div>

                            So the Q that we are tryna formulate hypotheses around is why does blorb feel so real? And unblorb feel so unreal, fake, melts into air, stage drop, meaningless?<br/><br/>Symmetry isn't enough because arguably both sides treating it as <i>fake</i> is also symmetrical. So uh, my own hypothesis falsified instantly! Good job Sandra but also… bad job!

So interestingly the mirror story experience happened the <i>second</i> time I played in an old school game. The first time I thought everything was business as usual. But then I went home and read the module and went "huh… all of that stuff was really there? Those bugs were really there, those traps were really there… and there was so much more to this place that we never found". It was more of a "huh" than a "mind blown" but then a few weex later I play again &amp; then mirror story.<br/><br/>That also originated transparency of method when I started my own group to DM for: I realized that part of the strong mindblowing effect during mirror story was that I <i>knew</i> that the stuff was really there in the prep. We do way less transparency of method now after playing together for five years.<br/><br/>A lot of the early blorb flame wars on here are about transparency of method, curtains etc.<br/><br/>So the way the players can break make-believe symmetry is for them to Schrödingerify particular traits (such as spell selection or equipment loadout) related to their character. That breaks the integrity of the game. The blorb is a precious &amp; fragile thing.                        </div>

                            OK, that's great, but I'm trying to understand what it is that is symmetrical. Is it just a commitment to not changing facts, adherence to blorb methods, or is it a psychological stance, a mental attitude, or a level of trust? I'd like to get a better sense of what you mean by "make-believe symmetry".                        </div>

                            Let me try to recap what I'm reading. My weak understanding of this is something like this. An analogy:<br/><br/>The off-stage canon gamestate is a black box, in the computer sense. An API. It has well-understood ways to interface with it during the game. The GM probably plays a role in operating it and might understand how it works, but they're not coding it on the fly. <br/><br/>Or if computer analogies make you uncomfortable, it's a machine and the GM is operating it on behalf of the players. You put actions into a funnel on the top, turn the crank, and it processes the actions and *clunk*, out comes some stuff.<br/><br/>The players do stuff for their characters. The GM and players input those actions into the machine and the GM turns the crank, and out comes <i>evidence of a new gamestate</i>. <br/><br/>Note, <i>a new gamestate</i> doesn't come out, because the gamestate never comes out. It lives in the machine. In fact, it's hard to tell where machine ends and gamestate begins; they're probably the same, or very close to it. (Note how the Big Model calls <i>all of this stuff</i> (System, Setting, Character, etc.) "Exploration" and nearly equates it, but not quite, with the Shared Imagined Space!)<br/><br/>When you're playing--and probably if you're GMing, if you're doing it "properly" (for blorb)--then you can't control the machine. That means that you can only guess what the output will be for a given set of inputs. The GM doesn't know--she has to turn the crank to find out. <br/><br/>It seems to me that the machine can be different things.<br/><br/>In blorb, it's prep and canon and gloricle and stuff. In other games that respect the black boxness of the machine, it's a shared understanding of how the canon works. I think the latter might be more what Vincent &amp; Meg &amp; Emily did, what Silmenume does. Though Silmenume's group invests more of that "machine power" in the GM, and V/M/E seem to have shared it more.<br/><br/>Is any of that right? <br/><br/>ETA:<br/><br/>Just read your <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22086/the-diegesis-easily-explained" rel="nofollow">Diegesis</a> post, so sory about SIS stuff. When I talk about SIS, I mean all of it, in "sense two"-shared, in a larger sense than "sense four"-shared.                         </div>

                            That's really interesting, Adam. I'm not being asked, so I can't say right or wrong, but I will just ask:<br/><br/>Are we conflating blorb and offscreen canon gamestate here? Because I've been thinking of them as very different things. (For instance, Vincent's game had a strong offscreen canon gamestate but no blorb whatsoever, as I understand it.)<br/><br/>I see blorb as a set of techniques and procedures, anyway. I know Sandra occasionally refers to a large thing with that, but I find a wider definition a bit slippery to consider (like how, for instance, it wouldn't make sense to call Vincent's Ars Magica game a "blorb" or "klockwerk" game).                        </div>

                            Sandra,<br/><br/>Yeah, I went back and read the Forge Glossary and was annoyed to find that, while it defined SIS as a near-synonym of Exploration, it doubled down on the shared-sense-4 stuff. I don't think that's how people used it <i>in discussion</i>, but I might be misremembering. In any case, we all understand it far better than they did, now in this thread.<br/><br/>And thanks for clearing up what the M in MIS stood for. I somehow missed the definition somewhere and was reading a lot of threads in a totally confused state.<br/><br/>I like to imagine the nomic bits of the gamestate engine as a very specific kind of compiler that throws errors or warnings at inputs that violate the social contract.                        </div>

                            Sandra,<br/><br/>Have you read any of the analysis about David Arneson's style of play, especially by Rob Kuntz in <a href="https://www.threelinestudio.com/store/dave-arneson-s-true-genius/" rel="nofollow">True Genius</a>? (Kuntz is largely incoherent, but there's a kernel of a cool idea there.)<br/><br/>Kuntz describes the revolutionary essence of a RPG, as invented by Arneson, as a self-modifying set of rules for creating story, with the GM taking on a role of owner of the gamestate machine (game state-machine? thinking of it as a state machine in the computational sense makes me happy).                        </div>

                            Adam,<br/><br/>I think what’s throwing me is the “black box” analogy - the box is analogous to the gamestate, right? If I’m understanding correctly...<br/><br/>How does the gamestate “spit out” new information, in other words?<br/><br/>I can’t quite tell if we’re thinking of SIS, Exploration (in the Forge sense), System (in the Forge sense), and gamestate as all converging into one entity, or trying to keep them separate.<br/><br/>Or is the black box just whatever procedures and techniques we’re using, which allow emergent output?<br/><br/>Just trying to get a handle on how you’re thinking about this.                        </div>

                            Right! So that’s where I’m getting thrown. You say that...
<blockquote class="Quote"><br/>...it's hard to tell where machine ends and gamestate begins; they're probably the same, or very close to it. (Note how the Big Model calls <i>all of this stuff</i> (System, Setting, Character, etc.) "Exploration" and nearly equates it, but not quite, with the Shared Imagined Space!)<br/></blockquote>
So, the machine and the gamestate are “probably the same”. Then you say that the Big Model would call this Exploration, which is, almost but not quite the SIS. <br/><br/>It sounds like all these things are nearly the same.<br/><br/>But then:
<blockquote class="Quote"><br/>It seems to me that the machine can be different things.<br/><br/>In blorb, it's prep and canon and gloricle and stuff.</blockquote>
If the gloracle is part of the machine, the machine isn’t just prep and canon and SIS (as you say, above), but it’s also Techniques and procedures - System, in other words.<br/><br/>At this point, it sounds like “the machine” is everything within the Social layer of the Big Model onion sketch: basically, everything about the act of roleplaying. Is that the intent here? I’m a bit lost. (It’s possible that I’m misunderstanding some of the programming metaphors, since I’m not a coder.)<br/><br/>In contrast, earlier we spoke of things like blorb being the set of techniques which operate on the gamestate. (In retrospect, this might just be more complicated than it needs to be because the terms we’re using keep mutating, evolving, and shifting.)                        </div>

                            I might not have everything 100% right.<br/><br/>My thought is that the GM and players use Techniques to interact with a game engine. This game Engine might include the rules as written, interpretations of those rules, additions to those rules, social contracts, "this is how we do it but we never really talked about it," and so on. It also includes data, like Gloricle stuff. The Engine probably includes techniques you can use to modify the Engine itself (not all groups use this).<br/><br/>The Engine changes the Game State. Techniques can be used to get feedback about the Game State, but the Engine never reveals 100% of the Game State. That is, the actual Game State is often partially obscured to the players and GM, who need to actively probe (Explore!) using Techniques to suss out what's in there.<br/><br/>In taking part in this Exploration, each participant constructs their own version of the Game State in their head. Call this Shared Imagined Space (SIS). <br/><br/>The parts of the SIS that overlap among the people at the table is the Mutual Imagined Space (MIS), which is the group's shared understanding of the Game State.<br/><br/>One of the Techniques is a different color because I wanted to show that some might be "privileged" or special. The one on the left could be a GM-only technique that allows them to tinker with the rules of the Engine in a prescribed way.<br/><br/>Exploration is just the combination of the Engine and the Game State. In object-oriented-programming terms, Exploration is the class; Engine is the set of methods and static data known at compile time; Game State is the data used at run time (and stored between games to be reloaded before the next game, perhaps imperfectly).<br/><br/>You can also liken Game State to the Big Model's "Ephemera"--sorta.<br/><br/>The five elements of Exploration from the Big Model are necessarily in here (as pentagons), but I wasn't sure where they belong in this context, thus no arrows connecting them. My feeling is that they're all load data for the Engine, but that's still a work in progress in my head.                        </div>

                            I'd also like to argue that MIS isn't all that important. Probably, at the table, it's important that everyone have an SIS that doesn't conflict too badly with other people's SISes, so MIS gets a cloud here, but overall, the MIS isn't really a <i>thing</i>.                        </div>

                            Hot stuff, Adam! That clarifies a lot of things.<br/><br/>With the caveat that we don't know what's going on with the Five Elements (if we take their position in the diagram literally, it doesn't make any sense), I can understand what you're going for with that top half.<br/><br/>I'm a lot less sure about the bottom half. (Although I bet everything looks like a nail to that GM! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> )<br/><br/>* What does it mean to have a SIS that's not shared? (I thought the MIS, in your diagram, is where the term SIS would normally go!)<br/><br/>* What's the relationship of the SIS's and MIS to the top part of the diagram? Clearly, they can't be separate from it.<br/><br/>The final question - and I think this is the point upon which this whole conversation turns - is whether we are looking at the construction of this mutually unknown gamestate as an actual entity (something actionable and concrete) or just a make-believe abstraction (wherein the people in the diagram are *pretending* that their statements and SIS's are interacting with an unknown gamestate). It's not clear to me what to make of that, just yet.<br/><br/>Great diagram - very helpful!<br/> </div>

                            Adam, you have the MIS a little backwards here.<br/><br/>The SIS is the shared-4 subset of the MIS. The MIS is the entire dungeon with all its unopened boxes and secret doors and all the stuff inside those boxes and inside those doors. The SIS is the subset of that that has been revealed at the table. And, in our new model, not a particularly important distinction. A particular fact happens to have been shared, which is a <i>little</i> bit relevant but it's not a referent-constructing life-changing moment.<br/><br/>The SIS is an intersection of the participants' individual imaginations.<br/>The MIS is a union of the participants' individual imaginations.<br/><br/>("Player" = "non-GM participant")                        </div>

                            In hindsight the word Mutual is extremely misleading. I was looking for shared-2, i.e the Swedish word "gemensam", which, well, pretty unambiguously means shared-2.<br/><br/>We share the MIS (uh, name change pending, but the shared-2 imagined space) the way we share a language. I might not know every word you know, yet, and vice versa.<br/><br/>We share the SIS (the Forge model SIS, the shared-4 imagined space) the way we share a piece of gossip. It becomes gossip <i>by</i> being told.<br/><br/> </div>

Only goes to show how far away they were from seeing the Threefold sim stuff. The blorb was truly a missing puzzle piece. Mirror story changed my life. I experienced true level and now un-blorby roleplaying games feel crooked♥

                            Paul,<br/><br/>The mutually unknown Game State is a real thing. <br/><br/>It's only impossible to "know" because of factors like:<br/><br/>* Gloricle elements like random charts that <i>will determine</i> the game state, when asked<br/>* no one has checked that part of the book yet (whose example was the 1st level hit points)<br/>* the complexity of the setting and situation, insomuch as no one ever really knows it completely until it's "interrogated" (perhaps by looking it up in a book, perhaps by thinking really hard about the game and applying Principles to determine the answer)<br/><br/><br/>It's a sort of quantum thing. The Game State is real. Knowing the Game State requires applying the Engine to get answers, and that is true for the players and the GM. <br/><br/>Even in non-blorb play, this is true. In Fiasco, there's a Game State, and the rules tell you have to turn the crank of the Engine to get more info about the Game State -- even if it just says that a player can make shit up on the fly...<br/><br/> </div>

                            It sounds like you're talking about a centralized one that contains a superset of all the beliefs of everyone at the table. That's how you get contradictory truths into it. But really, isn't that just the same as a slightly different gamestate in everyone's heads?                        </div>

                            Hello,<br/><br/>Suppose a game were run based around the principles contains in the movie Rashomon?  We have four players each constructing their own version of the events surrounds an end event where they each had some relationship to the victim - however tenuous?  While one of the movie's main "end event" is no longer socially acceptable to consider for play we can easily substitute something else.<br/><br/>The point is we end up with 4 different versions of how the final event came to be but no one knows what the "truth" of the matter is.  That's the whole point!  The point of the game is such that the characters with their own foibles and follies try to paint a picture of the event that make themselves look good.  We have this creative act ad nihilo, no reference book, no random tables.  The only things the happen are those that are created by the imaginations of the players.   We have no single or consensus view on what "actually" happened.<br/><br/>How does a single Game State handle this type of game?<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            Hello,<br/><br/>Maybe I misunderstand Game State but from what I understand that any specific game group/session/campaign has a Game State and that Game State is or reflects (I'm unclear on this topic) the Truth of what <i>really</i> transpired.  That is one of the claim's that, as I understand, is being made about Game State.  The Game State, which encompasses all that the players know and don't know, <i>cannot</i> contain contradictory facts.<br/><br/>So my  question about the general nature claim's of Game State is how it handles a game where there is by design no consensus?  Does this hypothetical game come into conflict with general claim of the Game State holding the truth of what happened in play.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            Yeah, no, as far as I'm concerned, a game's state can include contradictory facts. It depends on the game, of course.<br/><br/>My hypothesis here goes further. It suggests that contradictory facts in a game's state can be <i>incredibly valuable</i>, and that as a designer you might want to not only allow them, but include systems for creating them in your game on purpose.                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/lumpley">@lumpley</a>,<br/><br/>What you describe is a process, which puts a fact into a player's head and into the gamestate at the same time, and that fact might contradict another fact in their head or another player's head.<br/><br/>Are you saying that there's no basis of truth between them? I'd argue that even in a game designed to put vastly different facts into people's heads, if there's role-playing among them, the vast majority of the facts in the gamestate are going to line up with their heads.<br/><br/>I am imagining a game where shared "truth" is fleeting and tenuous. Maybe you're writing that now as a test. Ultimately, is there not any truth in this game? By truth, I mean that eventually the players can agree that things were a certain way. Shared consensus.

<blockquote class="Quote">It's a game's design that creates the relationship between its players' beliefs and its gamestate. You can't generalize any relationship between them across games with dissimilar designs.</blockquote>
So this gamestate has stuff in it. I'm not sure what stuff you include in the gamestate in your model. Truth? Mistakes? How does it get in there? I assume that Techniques (product of game design) is what gets it out into players' heads.<br/><br/>No relationship? I'd say its: [gamestate] ---feeds into---&gt; [techniques] ---output to---&gt; [players' beliefs] ---input to---&gt; [techniques] ---changes---&gt; [gamestate]<br/><br/> </div>

I'm having troubles with his formulation of Game State and was trying to work out an issue.<br/><br/>For myself, I play a game that where the GM feeds perceptions tailored to each individual player which thus frequently varies from player to player.  I do see the value in everyone having a slightly different take on what is going on.  That each player has a different view of the fictional world is a big part of the game.  Each player has a different Game State if what I've described falls into that category.  <br/><br/>I can see how contradictory facts can be, as you say, "incredibly valuable."<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>

                            Oh, no. Sandra and I agree that games' states can include contradictory facts. We're differing here only wrt design &amp; play, where I'm talking about introducing them on purpose and preserving them for their creative value, and Sandra prefers to avoid them when possible and resolve them with prejudice when they arise anyway.                        </div>

                            Yeah, I'm trying to nail down the "in species" distinction, to understand what you (Vincent) mean by gamestate here. It's probably a good idea to wait for you to share the demo game you're working on. Maybe it will clear things up.                        </div>

                            But... The glorious variety of potential models, views, and dynamics is exactly what designers find so appealing about the design space.  So you're talking about two different species.  So what?  The ludic taxonomy is vast!<br/><br/>Are you unhappy because you thought your model was global?  That can't really be the case, since you knew it was different than mine (among others) from day one.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, there are a lot of people here who are diggin' the blorb.

                            I'll grab the occasion of stating again that the french word for "game" or "play" also means "room to move", "looseness". My view is that games set constraints and leave room to explore. The game lumpley describes reminds me of For the Queen, where the eponymous character is unknown and central. It is often played "close to the shore". What would happen if players were to swing the Queen wildly from side to side, isn't it guaranteed contradictions ? and possibly an interesting character ?                        </div>
