Sure, if you want to publish a hard-copy in addition to the PDF - go crazy, but why neglect the PDF direction?  It is the most accessible medium, lowest barrier of entry, and allows you to offer an upgrade to the consumer when the final version is published.<br/><br/>I don't mean to be rude, I genuinely believe I'm missing some crucial detail.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175839/#Comment_175839" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-22T15:10:31+00:00" title="October 22, 2008  3:10PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aren't most ashcan releases distributed at conventions, so you can wave it around and say "check it out, I made a game," thereby impressing your friends and dismaying your enemies?  That'd be an excellent reason to go hardcopy-only; it's hard to pass out PDF files face-to-face, and waving a thumb drive around just makes you look silly.<br/><br/>Also, once you release a PDF into the wild, who knows where it'll end up?

In PDF format, you don't see the crappy xerox paper and the staples and the Cheeto stains.)<br/><br/>Also also, paper's easier to write on, and in most settings it's easier to read, too.

A tiny little wisp of a thing, with all the rules, very little information on how to play it, and an embarrassing rant on the state of horror gaming.

You can have a really great game (Thou Art But a Warrior, How We Came to Live Here) and still have almost nobody playtest it, aside from groups your organize yourself.  However, once you get a few people playtesting and posting about your game, you can usually get a few more, and then a few more.  It'll sometimes peter out, though.  For example, when the GoPlayNW folks started playing Geiger Counter, there were a few weeks where I got 60% of all the outside play AP the game has ever had.  Since then, I've gotten a few one-line notes that people have played and enjoyed it (which is awesome, don't get me wrong), but only a few isolated AP posts. Those are still super useful and I'll read over them like a hawk when I get around to writing the final version of the game, but it just goes to show that playtesting is a seesaw.<br/><br/>From my perspective, anything a creator can do to make it more likely that people will playtest their game is a good choice.  And this means releasing it in as many different formats as they have the time and energy to do.  PDFs are great, but if they don't get people to sit down and actually play your game, you may have to try something else.  Sometimes selling or giving away free print copies, even ones made on a photocopier like the Geiger Betas I gave away at GenCon, might help you with that... but, then again, they might not.  I'm not sure if I've received ANY posts from people who picked up one of those hardcopies.  That doesn't mean they were a bad idea, necessarily, but that I'm not sure they worked in this particular case, at that particular venue, without me running the game and helping get folks excited about it (since I had to bail on actually going to GenCon at the last minute).<br/><br/>Another issue is that... who is your playtesting audience really?  People have to be fairly committed to helping you with your game in order to playtest something, which usually means they have to be so excited about playing your game that they want to play it even when it isn't complete.  Honestly, folks who are really into indie games -- especially other indie game creator-publishers, the folks whose attention you might think you need to get for your game to be vetted / successful / etc. -- are probably less likely to do independent playtesting for you.  They already have a bunch of games they've been wanting to play for a while, in addition to their own game projects that they need to playtest.  If you can sit down with them at a housecon (frex. JiffyCon) or a larger convention (Dreamation, GenCon), you'll probably find they're more than happy to play your game and offer feedback, but getting folks to independently commit their own time is harder.<br/><br/>All that of which is to say: finding independent playtesters is hard.  You want really smart, thoughtful people who aren't already strongly committed to other projects and games, so they can take the time and attention to get excited about yours and actually play it, ideally more than once.  Honestly, you may be more likely to find those 1) locally, among people you've talked to in person about your game, 2) on a general site like RPGnet, or 3) from among the lurkers on SG more than from among the people who post a lot or have published one or more games.  How do you find those people?  Really, it's anybody's guess.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175897/#Comment_175897" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-23T06:05:13+00:00" title="October 23, 2008  6:05AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 23, 2008 6:05AM by Graham.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You don't just want people to download your game, read it once, and leave it on their hard drive forever.<br/><br/>By giving a hard copy, you make it more likely they play; by charging, you force them to <i>commit</i>; and, most importantly, by handing the copy to someone, you get to chat with them, build a relationship and explain what you want tested.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175911/#Comment_175911" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-23T08:38:51+00:00" title="October 23, 2008  8:38AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lots of valid reasons in this thread and I thank you all for educating me.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><br/>The whole point of an ashcan is to get people to pay for what they normally are paid to do - playtest.

However, I would be MUCH more likely to pay $7 to play the PDF ashcan version of a game rather than the $15 + $5 for shipping - maybe that's just me and no one else shares that behavior.  For instance, I doubt I would have purchased Poison'd if it was not available as a PDF.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175912/#Comment_175912" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-23T08:44:15+00:00" title="October 23, 2008  8:44AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the record, Poison'd is now in final edition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175985/#Comment_175985" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-23T18:50:09+00:00" title="October 23, 2008  6:50PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Some people are PDF people.
