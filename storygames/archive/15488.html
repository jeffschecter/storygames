You can ignore them, playing mainly with the people you like. Or you can engage them, attempting to find a way to work with them.<br/><br/>Note, especially, that these people aren't toxic. They've just got a different play style from the rest of the table. (And, sometimes, they're a little bit slow to realise that.)<br/><br/>Sometimes, it works if you engage these people.

If their energy up because it's their first Con game (or they're just excitable) I find engaging them and asking them questions about their character can make them, pause (and take a break from being loud). This pause can give the others a chance to roleplay and hopefully they'll get a better feeling for the appropriate tone.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they're the type that just likes to dominate conversations, and this is just another outlet for them to display their awesomeness, I use a more direct approach.

Interestingly, I facilitated a game a few months ago where the participants said up front "we want to learn how to facilitate this game", and having that permission and expectation meant I got to be both a fellow player and an instructor, which was cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351266/#Comment_351266" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-12T12:15:41+00:00" title="December 12, 2011 12:15PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 12, 2011 12:17PM by jenskot.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will call for a break. After the break, I will restate and reconfirm the game's goals, ask if there are any questions about those goals, give examples of what we don't want, and then repeat those goals. In many cases, the person in question has no idea they are being disruptive. Don't be subtle. <br/><br/>If the person is still jarring but not toxic (breaking the games agreed upon goals, cheating, bullying other players, being sexist / racist / homophobic), I will try to make sure they get their fair share of spotlight time but no more. Which includes asking them not to talk over other players when it isn't their spotlight time. Sometimes, because time can feel relative, I will actually time the length of their spotlight scenes and let them know when it's time to wrap up the scene. Or I will write down "scene" on an index card, put it in the middle of the table, and say, "if anyone feels any scene is going too long, just lift this up and we will wrap up this scene in a minute or less."<br/><br/>What character this person plays is also a factor. Get a sense of who these people are before anyone makes or chooses characters. Avoid giving this player power to steer the game's direction. Handing them a "leader" character can be a disaster (I try to avoid leader characters in general).<br/><br/>The GM can recruit this player. During a break, tell them what you want to achieve and ask them if they want to help. If they say yes, tell them what they can do to help achieve certain goals. I've repeatedly seen the most jarring player becomes the most helpful depending on what role they play in the game and how clearly the expectations of that role are made.<br/><br/>If I'm GMing, often I will sit as far away from the jarring player as possible and closest to the quietest players. That way it takes less effort for quiet players to engage the GM, and more effort for the person in question to engage. <br/><br/>Clear game descriptions that set expectations can be helpful. It gives you something to point to if the game goes in bizarre directions. <br/><br/>Before you start playing, socialize. Ask the players what games they like and dislike. Ask them why the chose to play this specific game. If this exchange of information reveals there may be problems, give players the option of an easy out. If this game doesn't fit their play style, you won't take it personally if they choose to step out now. You can offer to help get them into a different game. Ask your con organizers what to do in these situations. If someone wants to change games, who can help them?<br/><br/>I could go on for pages so I will stop now!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351269/#Comment_351269" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-12T12:24:15+00:00" title="December 12, 2011 12:24PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite><br/>If I'm GMing, often I will sit as far away from the jarring player as possible and closest to the quietest players.
