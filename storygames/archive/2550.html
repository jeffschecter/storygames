Which means I have to take This Ability and That Ability now." So you have to do some thought into career-pathing before going further.<br/><br/>I had a possible idea to take some of the weight of front-loading away, and wanted to throw that out into S-G:<br/><br/>Maybe create some kind of "stepped pyramid" levelling/character advancement structure.  So, in the example of, say, D&amp;D (with a MODIFIED Feat System), it would look something like this:<br/><br/>Every level you gain a Feat (told ya it was modified)<br/>Levels 1-4, for each class there are a few choosable feats, and maybe a few general feats. Maybe some stack on each other ("Improved Fast Strike requires Fast Strike").<br/>Then, at level 5, you hit a plateau. You no longer get feats from the level 1-4 pool (or, alternately, for something like Exalted, you'd automatically get the rest, or most of the rest).  Then there's a new pool of class and general feats from levels 5-8 to choose. NONE of these require feats from levels 1-4, or build off of them. It's like a completely divided space, where only these new feats exist. Same thing from levels 9-12, etc.<br/>Then, you divide the Feat/abilities section into not a laundry list of ALL abilities, but step those, too: Abilities for levels 1-4, 5-8, 9-12, etc. They're each in a new section or chapter.<br/><br/>That way, you can just play in the moment, still have the fun of levelling up, gaining XP, building your dude. And yet, you don't have the overhead of worrying about what you need to take NOW to get X LATER. When you get to that plateau, you can take any ability that you want without worry.<br/><br/>Also, it will be easier to jump into a game where "Level One" (or the basic char build in Exalted) isn't the starting position. If you want to have a game of all Level 12 characters (or "high plateau Exalted dudes"), you don't need to start them from Level 1 and build up from there in steps, you can jump straight to that level and put experienced characters together without a huge amount of downtime.<br/><br/>Now, some people will want to read ALL the data up-front to begin with for shits and giggles. It's not like Front-Loading is an Evil which must be destroyed, but for those folks who want to read all the rules, they're there; and for the people that like character progression but don't want to be worried at Character Generation Time what they need to take to have a decent build in X months down the road (*raises hand*), this might be a good alternative method.<br/><br/>Thoughts?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58694/#Comment_58694" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T08:23:15+00:00" title="March  2, 2007  8:23AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like it.

Seems pretty neat.  Although I can see certain people complaining because:<br/><br/>a) With the stepped progression where having X lets you buy Y later you usually see a pretty consistent progression with a character.  So I want to be "Mr Totally Awesome At Stabbing People In The Eye With A Rapier".  At level one I buy Rapier Combat, Level 2 I buy Poking, level 3 I get Improved Rapier Combat, Level 4 I get Improved Poking and at Level 5 I get Called Shot: Eye.  I've progressed along a single path.  If I can just buy Called Shot Eye once I'm level 5, I might have bought Club Combat at level 1, Bashing at level 2 etc etc and then just decided that I'd drop all that and buy my guy a rapier at level 5 and get Called Shot: Eye.<br/><br/>b) People who're gonzo for minmaxing will end up with very, very diverse characters.  That is, they'll get stuff from early levels in one area and then get when they hit the next plato they'll buy Improved versions of something completely different.  So I start off as a Bowman, then instead of becoming an Improved Bowman after level 5, I decide that I'll stay being good at Bows and add Improved Swordsman.  So I'm now as good a swordsman as the guy who wants to specialise in swords, plus, y'know, I can shoot arrows and shit too.<br/><br/>If the game's designed well, I can see both problems being solvable, but I personally wouldn't want to tackle getting something like that right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58698/#Comment_58698" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T08:42:35+00:00" title="March  2, 2007  8:42AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I also realized that what I'm suggesting is also, perhaps (depending on how you look at it), doing something like combining the four D&amp;D boxed sets into a single book; but not like the Rules Cyclopedia (which again, ties everything together from levels 1-36), but rather "Chapter One: Basic Set", "Chapter Two: Advanced Set" etc.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58699/#Comment_58699" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T08:42:59+00:00" title="March  2, 2007  8:42AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think, more generally, that you may be talking about players <i>graduating</i> into new rulesets as their characters advance.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike "Attacks of opportunity?

If I have to wait 4 levels before getting assassin tokens, that reinforces that notion; in fact, it would make me never play characters below L5.  One thing that's so cool about IH is that you start out with competent characters and have tokens to play with right away.<br/><br/>That all said, there's another way to go at this, which is to do away with requirements but allow synergy going into specializations.  So Poking would apply to all poking weapons, but Rapier Combat only to rapiers.  Their effects stack.  It makes more sense to get Poking first, because it has a broader application, but if you want to end up being a rapier expert it doesn't matter which one you take first, you can always take the other one later and gain the synergy.  And Improved Whatever then adds +1 instead of +2 of the basic ones, so you <i>could</i> get it first, but it makes more sense to get the basic one first.  Still, if you <i>did</i> take it first, once you take the basic one, you're back at the same efficiency level as someone who went the other way.  So basically, you can make up for non-optimal choices over time.<br/><br/>That kind of system is something I've been playing around with for a design in which each ability gives a certain bonus to either the type of tool you're using for it, the type of effect you're trying to achieve, or some other function.  So if you've got Melee Combat, Blade Training, and Basic Maneuvers, then you'd have a +3 when doing a melee maneuver with a sword (say, disarm), +2 when trying to do harm with a sword (i.e., a non-maneuver), +2 when doing a maneuver with a non-bladed weapon, +1 trying to do harm with a non-blade weapon, and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58714/#Comment_58714" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T09:16:10+00:00" title="March  2, 2007  9:16AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2007 9:17AM by Colin_Fredericks.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rich, some of the comments you brought up can be avoided by creating an entirely new playing field at each level. Perhaps you retain your Rapier In The Eye skill from 4th level, which will be quite handy against 1st-4th level monsters, but at 5th you pick up Perfect Parry, which disarms anyone who doesn't have a perfect defense (a la Exalted). All your low-level stuff retains utility, but typically against weaker opponents or in very specific situations.

I do it mainly because the thing D&amp;D deals with -- combat -- can take forever as a high-level character has to do multiple rolls, count up dice and the like.  I've had more fun fighting with my level 1 human cleric than with my level 21 half-dragon barbarian.  But I digress (except to say that I'd love it if any potential system didn't include more tedious math).<br/><br/>I am keen on this idea.  As someone who had to build a high-level character to start the game (the GM gave us the aforementioned 21 levels), I spent a long time dealing with what you're talking about Andy, from the other side of the situation.  I have to say that being forced to take what were very useless feats in order to get access to cool ones down the road (as an epic-level character doesn't really need a +1 attack or other small things -- sure, they don't hurt, but they aren't the sort of things that are awesome).  There's a feat that I was looking at a couple months back after we levels, but the ones that really grabbed me required me to have taken stuff several levels back -- spend skill points where required and take basic feats.  So that feat was a no-go, though I could have started working for it at this point if I really wanted.<br/><br/>I half-joked to myself that my character should settle down and raise a family, so they could have opportunities that he didn't have.  But if the system worked like this idea, I wouldn't have felt, well, annoyed that the game had this cool option, and I could have access to this cool option right now -- right when I have the ability to increase my character's awesomeness -- if someone handed me this book a couple months earlier.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex" title="Alex"><img alt="Alex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex">Alex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58749/#Comment_58749" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T11:04:03+00:00" title="March  2, 2007 11:04AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Then, at level 5, you hit a plateau.

They'd still be on your sheet (and as I said, a likely option of "once you reach the next plateau, you automatically get all the abilities from the previous plateau" may apply if there's only a few abilities per plateau).<br/><br/>It's just that all the Plateau 0 abilities will Never be pre-requisites for any Plateau 1, 2 etc abilities. <br/><br/>If it was Exalted, you would see instead of one huge tree of inter-locking requisite charms, you'd see small groups of 4-6 charms (that perhaps interlock) of different power levels, with no inter-lock between them.<br/><br/>OH!! I thought of one example: <b>The Lone Wolf books</b>. When you were a Kai warrior you selected X out of 10 or so abilities, X being "How many other Lone Wolf books you completed (+2 or something).<br/><br/>Eventually, at book 8 or 10 or something, they said, "OK, now you're a <b>MAGNAKAI</b>!  That means that, remember all those Kai abilities from the other books? You know them ALL, you're that badass.  But now, there's these new MAGNAKAI abilities, and you get them at a rate of 3+ (how many Lone Wolf Magnakai books you have played).<br/><br/>Imagine that, but with UltraKai, MegaKai, and... uh... SupremeExcellenceKai, and at each plateau you have all the abilities of the previous plateau (and in future conflicts as an UltraKai, your UltraKai abilities will be really useful, and your Kai abilities will only give you a little bitty edge, as now the stakes are higher.<br/><br/>To compare this to Exalted, the exalted rules list all the Kai, MagnaKai, (Andy invented) UltraKai, (Andy invented) MegaKai all together in one place.  And to get some MegaKai ability, you first need to have on your sheet these two of six UltraKai abilities, which require in turn 5 of 8 MagnaKai abilities, which to get you need to have taken 9 of 11 of these Kai abilities.  In my mind, an Interesting way to do things is to split them into discreet, no-crossover plateaus that don't require requisite abilities from their group.<br/><br/>With Exalted, I could actually go into the rules, and, like, DO THIS, and post it as an alternate chargen/play style (Andyxalted). But it would be kind of a lot of work, and a pain in the butt.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58760/#Comment_58760" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T11:36:11+00:00" title="March  2, 2007 11:36AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This has give me a different idea -- feats that grow with the character.  Instead of taking "Bean Counting" and then "Improved Bean Counting," itself a prereq for "Count Focus," etc., you take the core feat at some point.  Next time you can take a feat, your "Bean Counting" feat turns into "Improved," and so on.  It wouldn't replace the fact that you get a new feat -- that's still part of this setup.  Example:<br/><br/>Level 1:  I take Bean Counting<br/>Level 3: Bean Counting becomes Improved Bean Counting.  I'm also taking Exotic Weapon Proficency (Banjo).<br/>Level 6: Improved Bean Counting becomes Master Bean Counting, and Exotic Weapon Proficency (Banjo) becomes Weapon Focus (Banjo).  I'm also taking Skill Focus (Riverdancing).<br/>etc.<br/><br/>This answers the question in a different way.  Instead of reducing the influence of prereqs, this assumes you'll keep improving in your skills and will get to that "Awesome thing you can do" point.  You could incorporate the idea of the plateaus, and separate gaining new feats and improving existing ones.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58781/#Comment_58781" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T13:05:28+00:00" title="March  2, 2007  1:05PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh.

This works even better than a videogame, because for an RPG, everything's got to be out there on the table.  There's no black-box.  The GM can't handle simultaneous player actions, so just about every game has turns, and if you're polite and smart, you watch and listen to the turns of others.  You see them run through the mechanics, and you learn vicariously - not with the same fidelity as doing yourself, but it's workable.<br/><br/>So when you hit Kai1, you get all the Kai0 tier stuff, and you have a reasonable working knowledge of it because you've seen your friends learning to use it.  If you're unsure of something about it, hell, you've got an expert sitting right there: "Hey, Rebecca, should I put Kai Cuts the Horizon in this combo?  Is it going to be any good against this guy we're fighting?"<br/><br/>I think you can keep low-level abilities useful throughout the tiers without too much trouble.  Videogames do this all the time - the basics are still valuable weapons in your arsenal even in the final boss fight (the Okami boss battle uses every single brush technique, IIRC).  Exalted 2 with its excellencies and WotG do it well.  D&amp;D?  Well, D&amp;D is a big space, but I find myself metamagicing up 2nd to 4th level spells to 9th+ pretty routinely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58840/#Comment_58840" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T20:42:15+00:00" title="March  2, 2007  8:42PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm fond of just cutting the number of character options down to an actually manageable level, tossing prereqs entirely, then ensuring that the flavorful choice is also the tactically optimal choice. <a href="http://bb.bbboy.net/thegamingden-viewthread?forum=1&amp;thread=723" rel="nofollow">Frank and K have made a good go of doing that.</a><br/><br/>Seriously, it's easier, and it let's you actually be a sniper or a skirmisher or whatever right away, rather than just coming into your own at level 15.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58938/#Comment_58938" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-04T12:56:01+00:00" title="March  4, 2007 12:56PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alex</cite>For a twist, imagine starting the PCs off at the top of the proverbial pyramid, with really awesome powers but few of them.
