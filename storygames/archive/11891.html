I'm moving down there soon but in the meantime it means weekend bus trips and webcam chats. I have been going kind of psycho about game design and playing RPGs lately so I couldn't stop talking about it, and finally I was like, "LET'S PLAY BREAKING THE ICE." She has a little bit of gaming experience, some mediocre D&amp;D games in college and a few games at conventions.<br/><br/>Our Switch was gender. I made Latisha, a jazz musician and hyper-aggressive personality. Carly made Ian, a gardener with more awkwardness per ounce than Napoleon Dynamite. Our drink during the game was whiskey and lemonade. I finished the whiskey last night by myself so I'm hung over this morning, so bear with me.<br/><br/>Ian's Conflict was that he was obsessed with Lady Gaga. Latisha's Conflict was that she hated sex (I love choosing extreme Conflicts, the last time I played my Conflict was 'violent jealousy'). These came up frequently on the first date but by the second we had enough Compatibilities that we didn't need to bring them into play.<br/><br/>The first date was at a cafe. They got some drinks, had a horribly awkward conversation (Ian would regularly make a blatant come-on and then shout the disclaimer, "I RESPECT WOMEN!"), and discovered a shared love of mixed drinks. Ian got slapped a few times or aggressively called on his come-ons, and he stumbled his way through bringing up the baggage of his last relationship and his love of Lady Gaga at inopportune times. They found out they both liked Tarantino movies and went back to Ian's to watch movies and <i>totally did it</i>.<br/><br/>"I thought she hated sex?"<br/>"She does but apparently not with Ian." We picked up one more compatibility. Physical chemistry.<br/><br/>For the second date Ian came to a show Latisha was playing at. She played a jazz cover of Telephone (?!) and dedicated it to him. The set ended, the night was still young, so they went down a couple blocks to a rock show and had a good time.<br/><br/>By this point the whiskey bottle was half empty and we were both pretty sloppy so we called it a game. We might have been doing the rules wrong but we had racked up a high intimacy and quite a few compatibilities between Ian and Latisha and our post-game conversation was like:<br/><br/>"Man, they are TERRIBLE for each other."<br/>"I know. I think they have one of those relationships that starts off and gets some momentum with neither of them really understanding why it's working, and then all of a sudden it crashes into a wall and explodes."<br/><br/>I was a bit worried that maybe I was gaming the dice too much and not following the fiction, but I have seen that exact thing happen in real life so whatever.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265638/#Comment_265638" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-05T12:17:29+00:00" title="April  5, 2010 12:17PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 5, 2010 12:20PM by Emily_Care.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Delightful! Sounds to me like did fine. Skipping the third date due to time constraints and doing a wrap-up based on what you'd seen is all perfectly respectable. You'd figured out what a car-wreck this relationship was, so cool. <br/><br/>This:\n<blockquote>(Ian would regularly make a blatant come-on and then shout the disclaimer, "I RESPECT WOMEN!")</blockquote>\nmade me laugh out loud. <br/><br/>And as for following the fiction--the mechanics kind of beg to be gamed, and as long as you were both okay with what happened it's all good. If Carly let you have them, they stand. It's especially not cheating to drop the Conflicts after a bit: they are meant to be optional once you've got some good compatibilities and attraction going on. Which is a good thing when people choose extreme conflicts! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>All things I have to remember to mention in the three-in-one volume.

Nice to hear that Emily's working on it, should be an viewpoint on those games now that they're all done.<br/><br/>And no, I don't think that it's worth waiting for if you don't already have BtI. Unless maybe you're planning to get all three games, in which case it's debatable. Even then, better get the game now than miss a chance to play it; I've found that while I like playing BtI very much, the occasion for it doesn't come up very often.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274652/#Comment_274652" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-05T01:04:09+00:00" title="June  5, 2010  1:04AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Multiple slaps (!) and they still get it on... followed by a jazz cover of a Lady Gaga song.
