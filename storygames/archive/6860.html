They would essentially be riding dragons.  How exactly would this be run?  Is there a rule system I can jack, copy, or be inspired by, instead of trying to just wing it?  (no pun intended)  <br/>\n<br/>\nHave any of you run something like this before?  I'm fine with freeform, but my players like rules...<br/>\n<br/>\n1. I was planning having a fairly detailed map of the terrain that they could maneuver through.<br/>\n2. Ground forces they would have to avoid.<br/>\n3.I was thinking that bows, crossbows, and maybe swords would be the weapons used instead of "dragon breath" but I'm open to it.<br/>\n4. I would need a fly speed, a max angle of climbing, cornering speeds that kind of thing, which I would need to make up<br/>\n<br/>\nAny help would be great!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152661/#Comment_152661" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-24T07:08:37+00:00" title="June 24, 2008  7:08AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What system?

It's a good book, but there's tactical stuff in there that could be mined for your game pretty easily.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152766/#Comment_152766" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-24T16:07:21+00:00" title="June 24, 2008  4:07PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2008 4:09PM by Mike Montesa.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm thinking to set this up like a modern day (well, Vietnam) air assault. I get my jollies off stuff like this so here goes:\n<blockquote>I was planning having a fairly detailed map of the terrain that they could maneuver through.</blockquote>\nIs it an actual beach they're hitting or did you say "beachhead" as a figure of speech? If it's the latter, I like a nice alpine mountain valley with the objective at the center of what amounts to a crossroads or pass. This gives you canyons, gorges, and hills to maneuver around, bridges and trees to avoid, and is just very scenic. Or if that doesn't work, at least hilly terrain to allow for NOE (Nap Of the Earth) flying. With high ground you can have defenders in lookouts higher than the main objective on the valley floor. You can also put defensive positions up there too.\n<blockquote>Ground forces they would have to avoid.</blockquote>\nIn those lookouts and defensive positions in the hills, you have your "anti-aircraft" SAM units (anti-dragon units): Ballista - big, heavy, long-ranged one shot deals that do tremendous damage (your fantasy SAM-7s) - no good against close range, fast, low altitude targets (because they track too slow) which means the defense against them is to fly low and fast at treetop level; light, rapid firing multi-shot ballista (your fantasy ZSU-23s), squads of dedicated anti-dragon crossbowmen, and don't forget peasant farmers taking potshots at you with their old long bows.\n<blockquote>I was thinking that bows, crossbows, and maybe swords would be the weapons used instead of "dragon breath" but I'm open to it.</blockquote>\nCan you limit the number of times the dragons can breath fire? That makes this heavy ordnance, and you only get one shot with it to put it on target. Give the dragons fighting platforms on their backs that can carry a small squad of spear and crossbowmen.\n<blockquote>I would need a fly speed, a max angle of climbing, cornering speeds that kind of thing, which I would need to make up</blockquote>\nHrm, I suppose that depends on how you want to model things. Assuming you want to. I'd work it by weight. The bigger, heavier dragons (bombers) have less maneuverability. Smaller dragons are of course faster and turn tighter.<br/><br/>If the enemy has it's own air force, they should be up there too! Interceptor griffons going after the dragons, pegasi and war eagles engaging your fighter dragons, lot's of cool stuff here!<br/><br/>Give the enemy a nice, tight air defense network to be penetrated first. Outlying anti-air and signallng outposts along the inbound route need to be suppressed and taken out. Enemy fighter CAP has to be cleared. <br/><br/>So you got your single seat F-4 and F-8 dragons (or maybe war eagle pilots?) flying ahead of the main strike force on enemy Mig-19 griffon and Mig-21 pegasi sweep. Once those are driven off, then you got your smaller A-7 and A-6 strike dragons blasting a hole through the enemy ballista network on SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defense) missions. <br/><br/>Once that's opened up, you send in your B-52 dragons, the ancient wyrms with bellies full of fire. Or, somewhat smaller A-6 Intruder strike dragons going in low and fast for more precision attacks on key targets.<br/><br/>I love the smell of dragonfire in the morning!<br/><br/>Told you I get my jollies off this stuff!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
