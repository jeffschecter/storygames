Y'know, make a "town" (a community) and keep having the sin escalate until there's a monster with d10 "demonic influence" that's preying on people.  Use the standard Dogs rules, but swap out the coat for something else cool.  Have the characters come to town Scooby Doo style or have them connected to one of the victims, Afraid-style.  Maybe allow the characters to gradually learn "rituals" over the course of play as they gather more information about the monster, techniques or weaknesses that give them more dice to roll against the monster and its victims.  Use Fallout as normal instead of Conditions, but you can definitely encourage players to take new traits like "d4 - claustrophobic" that's just asking them to be framed into specific kinds of conflicts or situations.<br><br>Dogs is robust and works really well.  Just go with what works and steal some of the good ideas from Afraid without trying to play a partially finished game that's known to have a bunch of problems.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241016/#Comment_241016" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-08T23:29:54+00:00" title="November  8, 2009 11:29PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps they're after a certain part of the Afraid experience that you can tap into with a different game:<br><br>My Life with Master does the lurking horror thing.<br/>The Infected does the "start with lurking horror, escalate to zombie hordes" thing.<br/>I don't know what else to suggest, off hand.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241022/#Comment_241022" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-09T02:45:49+00:00" title="November  9, 2009  2:45AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I found Afraid problematic.<br/><br/>You can always use the Afraid monster creation rules, but substitute another resolution system: say, The Shadow Of Yesterday.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241026/#Comment_241026" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-09T05:39:08+00:00" title="November  9, 2009  5:39AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What problems did people have?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe played 4+ sessions and it went well overall.<br/>\n<br/>\nProblems we had:<br/>\n- it's super lethal, a virtual meat grinder (took a bit for players to get used to this but I was ok with it)<br/>\n- to win, many characters have to die (fixed with the "your character goes into hibernation" rule)<br/>\n- making new characters wasn't super fast<br/>\n- bonds and supernatural items were unclear (easily ignorable)<br/>\n- some monster creation questions were unclear (easily ignorable)<br/>\n- Dogs situations feel like they run themselves, Afraid situations were a bit more work (but less so than most traditional games)<br/>\n- "in trouble" condition didn't feel as meaningful as the other conditions since we were almost always in trouble anyway but we could have misunderstood how this was meant to be used<br/>\n<br/>\nWe loved:<br/>\n- base dogs system<br/>\n- conditions<br/>\n- keep 2 dice for giving<br/>\n- escalation = ignore an attack &amp;

By the time the characters had weakened the monster by freeing one victim from its control, the monster had successfully victimized at least one other person and had weakened the characters in other ways, so it felt like, overall, there would be steadily diminishing returns or, at best, take a really, really long time to get anywhere close to beating the monster.<br><br>The other thing that was problematic was the limited number of conditions.  We kept getting the same ones all the time, which just felt very artificial and didn't fit into the overall thrust of the story.  If there were 10 conditions (hey, it's Geiger Counter!) or you could freely invent them (hey, it's Lady Blackbird!), I think that would go a long way towards mitigating it.<br><br>And, yeah, there were other things about how the conflict mechanics worked that I'm less sure about, so I'll trust in John's assessment there.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241058/#Comment_241058" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-09T09:17:45+00:00" title="November  9, 2009  9:17AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great point about the number of conditions. We encountered that as well. I really like the varied conditions in Geiger Counter.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also ran into the issue of diminishing returns. The monster has the advantage and for every edge we received the monster received a greater edge. The solution which I think is intentional but I could be way wrong is that this cycle breaks as characters die. If I remember correctly, everyone "levels up" when a PC dies. But this means making new characters. Which takes time but isn't too bad. The time issue for us was mostly in spending scenes to integrate new characters into what's going on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241060/#Comment_241060" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-09T09:40:51+00:00" title="November  9, 2009  9:40AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The biggest problem, for us, was the combination between scene framing, mechanics which forced characters to be alone and the lengthy Dogs-style resolution system.<br><br>So you'd frame someone in their first scene.
