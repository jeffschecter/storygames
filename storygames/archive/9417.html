I've recently started up my first more "traditional" game in while, an nWoD game, and it's going pretty well.  It's not *too* piled with rules to make me feel utterly overwhelmed (though I know I have been leaving out a lot of things.)<br/><br/>Still.  I really dislike statting up NPCs.  It's just not much fun, in my opinion.  I love thinking of new NPCs, and how they might intersect with the PCs, but I don't like actually sitting down and filling out a sheet for them.  It feels too much like work.  And work that isn't all that much fun.<br/><br/>Does anyone have any suggestions for ways to make this process faster or easier or more interesting?  nWoD specific suggestions are, obviously, very welcome, but I also mean this for any other game that has extensive character stats (for example, I also had this problem the one time I tried to get a Burning Wheel game started).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208775/#Comment_208775" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-22T21:28:45+00:00" title="May 22, 2009  9:28PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've recently been playing with the notion that every player generates a character and an antagonist, antagonists are randomly assigned back to the player group, or distributed among the background stories.

However, I do like this idea, and I might use it for the second stage of our game after the hunters become changelings.  by that point they should know enough about changelings to help me create interesting enemies.  i'll still probably make a few on my own, so they don't know everything they're up against, but maybe they can make their primary rival in their court, or something like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208781/#Comment_208781" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-23T00:15:28+00:00" title="May 23, 2009 12:15AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find that character generation software tends to make the creation of NPCs less onerous. As a rule, I tend not to actually stat up my NPCs until I've got some assurance that they'll get some screen time. If they come into a scene briefly, I'll arbitrarily decide skills/stats as necessary for that interaction, and note it down for later, when/if I decide to stat out the character. I don't want to 'waste' my time statting up an NPC that dies non-dramatically in an early scene, or gets written out of the story due to player actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, that's a sort of GM-damage, caused when I'd set up elaborate plotlines and stat out NPCs, only to find that all my preparation goes for naught when the players do something entirely unexpected. Applying a little leverage isn't something I'm against, but shoehorning the PCs into my pre-written plot is never a bad habit I've developed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis" title="Jarvis"><img alt="Jarvis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/neastrith1/Smiley_Avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis">Jarvis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208783/#Comment_208783" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-23T03:05:30+00:00" title="May 23, 2009  3:05AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2009 3:07AM by Jarvis.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://wiki.white-wolf.com/worldofdarkness/index.php?title=Quick_NPCs" rel="nofollow">This is all I use</a> for NPCs in my current game.

This is because of how player characters already have such profiles. Consider:\n<ul>\n<li>My character is good at hitting things, and is now going to hit a NPC. Therefore, he gains an advantage in the resolution system.</li>\n<li>My character is bad at hitting things, but is still going to hit the NPC. Therefore, he gains a disadvantage in the resolution system.</li>\n</ul>\nCompare this to the much more complex standard model, which has four cases: a competent PC vs. incompetent NPC, a competent PC vs. competent NPC, an incompetent... you get the idea. The standard model has much more grain, but in reality it all gets linearized anyway: you have a certain amount of advantage or disadvantage against the NPC, and it depends on how your own character's profile stacks against the NPC's profile. In reality it's always going to depend on the PC's profile more, as that's the character everybody has been staring at for the last four sessions, while the NPC is some nobody whose statistics are only known by the GM. Besides, player characters are usually much more min-maxed (another name for being dramatically structured, rather than all-around dull and average) than NPCs, which means that their ability levels are more volatile, and therefore are more important as determinants for who has the advantage in a given situation.<br/><br/>Realizing this, the one obvious panacea to too complex NPCs is to stop screwing around with skill lists and such for them - you don't need any of that, you just need one number for the players to roll against. One number and perhaps some special crunch (like Secrets in Solar System) if it's important. The system still works exactly the same: player chooses to engage the NPC, dice are rolled, results are generated. PCs fare well in their own areas of strength, while they fare not so well in their areas of weakness. Dramatically speaking, this is all the detail you need. And if you find that you need more, it's easy enough to improvise when that one in ten (or a hundred) situation comes up.<br/><br/>So: one number. Give the Prince ten dice and the mortal nobody one die. Everything else is luxury.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208791/#Comment_208791" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-23T07:58:26+00:00" title="May 23, 2009  7:58AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jarvis</cite><a href="http://wiki.white-wolf.com/worldofdarkness/index.php?title=Quick_NPCs" rel="nofollow">This is all I use</a>for NPCs in my current game</blockquote>This looks great!  Though I'm not sure they should top the power stats out at 5.  Still, I think I'll definitely have to make a copy of this.  Should work very well for doing slightly complex NPCs slightly on the fly.<br/><br/>Eero, I agree with most everything you said, and I tend to do the kind of thing you describe frequently.  That said, for NPCs that seem to be important, I often like to come up with a slightly more detailed set of stats for them.  I mean, if it was a political game and they were going to be dealing with the Prince on a regular basis in more than one context, I don't think I'd be happy with just rolling 10 dice for him every time.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208794/#Comment_208794" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-23T08:51:06+00:00" title="May 23, 2009  8:51AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2009 8:53AM by JDCorley.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The enemies are probably going to need to be statted out.

Like:<br/><br/>Occult Research (5 dice), <i>I think I have a book somewhere talking about that...</i> Joe Blow has inherited a small occult library from his crazy uncle Benny, and although it's not much, he's studied it thoroughly.<br/><br/>The idea that between the first person statement, the flavor text, and the fact that 5 dice are involved, you have a decent baseline for what they're capable of in the field they're likely to be called upon.  It sounded kinda lame to me at first but then I realized that the first person text actually was the most helpful part of the trait, it helped me get it across in-game far more interestingly than just narrating or, worse, just putting it in my own head how good someone was and rolling that.<br/><br/>I add to this the following: I always write down their Resistance attributes, because that's normally what PCs have to overcome when sneaking around or yelling at them.

I have a decent idea of the general abilities and histories of the NPCs, and so if I need to roll for some NPC during a game, I grab the right number of dice and go. As long as you know what your NPCs are like and understand the benchmarks of your system, it's quick and easy and consistent enough for game purposes.<br/><br/>Supernatural powers might mix things up a bit - but I'm running REIGN and there's not a lot of those in the campaign. If <i>every</i> NPC had supernatural powers, I'd want to read up on the most common ones too - maybe have a cheat sheet handy.<br/><br/>So if a typical NPC is taking an action that he's moderately experienced with, I'll roll four dice. Five dice if he's more skilled, or a more capable character. Six dice if the NPC is a capable guy and he's particularly good at this task. And so on.

I think that the core of my objection comes down to a split in perception about what NPCs are. JD rather put his finger on it by splitting out NPCs and lesser characters. <br/><br/>In many, many games that I play there are some NPCs who are, by both desire and necessity of the structure of the game, as round and full of characters as the PCs. While few of them will get as much screen time as a PC, they do get significant screen time (maybe 1 to 2 vs PCs) and they do have significant, notable traits and abilities of their own. That is to say, "while the NPC is some nobody whose statistics are only known by the GM" is absolutely untrue in this type of game. Not only is the NPC not nobody, or not merely and obstacle or foil to the PCs, but they have definable strengths and weaknesses that the players, even if they'd never actually seen the NPCs sheet, could probably write out with as much accuracy as they could write out the abilities of the other PCs. The kinds of conflicts these NPCs engage in with the PCs is nearer to PC vs PC conflict, and so the needs of the system shift. <br/><br/>(Notably these kinds of NPCs rarely ever come up in games where things are far more PC centric. I've not yet had one show up in Trollbabe, for example.) <br/><br/>Which brings me to the OP. <br/><br/>Brain, Dude! I was totally going to tell you something cool. Then JD stole it from me. This is because JD has hacked my brain and steals everything cool from it. <br/><br/>Seriously though, you'll find that in a lot of WW published settings and adventures they use that system. Important NPCs (not in terms of world power, but in terms of importance in detailed interactions with PCs as another round character) get full stats and writeups. Less important NPCs get a few flavorful dicepools and sometimes a generic threat level. This was done, believe it or don't, not because the writers were too lazy to do full NPC statblocks, but because they found out that it actually worked better in actual play. <br/><br/>(Yes, despite the rumors, some WW writers actually play games.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208830/#Comment_208830" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-23T19:49:39+00:00" title="May 23, 2009  7:49PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for all the input, everyone!

While few of them will get as much screen time as a PC, they do get significant screen time (maybe 1 to 2 vs PCs) and they do have significant, notable traits and abilities of their own. That is to say, "while the NPC is some nobody whose statistics are only known by the GM" is absolutely untrue in this type of game. Not only is the NPC not nobody, or not merely and obstacle or foil to the PCs, but they have definable strengths and weaknesses that the players, even if they'd never actually seen the NPCs sheet, could probably write out with as much accuracy as they could write out the abilities of the other PCs. The kinds of conflicts these NPCs engage in with the PCs is nearer to PC vs PC conflict, and so the needs of the system shift.<br/></br></blockquote>\nWe're probably not that far apart in actual practice, Brand - at least I have difficult believing that people really use those detailed stat blocks for NPCs. I've been trying to do it for years, but ultimately that practice only causes me to <i>shirk on preparations</i> I should do because they're to much of a bother or because I get stuck on the one character when I should be creating five. It's much better to play with a stat block so absolutely simple that I can keep it in my head or create it in real-time as needed.<br/><br/>As an example of my practice, consider two of the most important NPCs from my current TSoY campaign:<br/><br/><b>Nadir Hazer</b><br/>An Elven Asshole, <b>Master (3)</b><br/><b>Pool</b> 6<br/>He has an old Three-Corner magic staff that he created a hundred years ago. Currently a swashbuckler sort, uses memories of past lives to operate the staff.<br/><br/><b>Black Joan</b><br/><b>Pool</b> 8<br/>Crazy Terrorist Moon-Witch, <b>Master (3)</b><br/><br/>Of course these characters have much nature and fictional detail, but those are pretty much the facts that engage the rules-system for me. I can't imagine needing anything else: if a character strikes either of these in a dramatically weak spot, I downgrade the Ability rating a step or at most two to depict how the character is, in fact, weaker in that way. If somebody actually laid hands on Joan, there, she'd wrestle at mere <i>Adept (1)</i>, for example. But what else would I need for them, really? Could be that the rules-set of Solar System somehow streamlines how NPCs are engaged, as I see no added value in giving the characters f.ex. Passive resistance Abilities that player characters have. I could say that Joan is a Master at mental resistance and merely Adept at physical resistance, but those are the numbers I'd be using anyway, deriving them from the one number. Having a large skill list would actually just make the dramatic presence of the character arbitrary - it would sort of suck if a character performed at the "wrong" level of ability because I forgot to give him Use Rope as one of his 20 skills.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to deny experiences others have - rather, I'm interested in the GM psychology when using a full stat block: do you get some added value from the stat block? Do you use those numbers for something? Or is the practice of putting them down somehow beneficial to expressing the character in play?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208953/#Comment_208953" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-25T08:58:40+00:00" title="May 25, 2009  8:58AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I tend to stat my NPCs as if they were <i>3:16</i> characters, in NWoD and in anything else. Most NPCs are around to do one thing, so I decide, based on the system, how could they should be at that one thing, and then give them an "everything else" stat at low-average. Sometimes they warrant two named stats. So:<br/><br/>NWoD NPCs:<br/><br/>Bruiser Vampire<br/>Fighting Ability: 8<br/>Non-fighting Ability: 3<br/><br/>Occultist Mage<br/>Researching Ability: 7<br/>Magic: 6<br/>Everything else: 3<br/><br/>It's quick, and it means I can come up with the character on the fly, and then amend them to provide more or less challenge (if they are opposed to the PCs) without any trouble.<br/><br/>If an NPC starts to become a "regular", either as a recurring enemy or ally, then they get a character sheet, and I stat them up between sessions, doing my best to ensure they match what the PCs have seen so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208954/#Comment_208954" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-25T09:00:00+00:00" title="May 25, 2009  9:00AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, <br/><br/>I think part of what we're facing here is definitions of "full statblock." I rarely play games that have such detailed stats that its hard for me to make them up quickly. Or games that have "Use Rope" as an individual skill. So part of the seeming divide is probably around the level of detail we expect a stat block to have. <br/><br/>For WoD games, specifically, I do sometimes use full statblocks when I'm making important NPCs (or, more often, upgrading a minor NPC who has become a full NPC in terms of play.) The reason for this, more or less, is because it puts the NPC both systemically and emotionally/psychologically for me (and others at the table) on par with the PCs. Well, more or less. <br/><br/>Anyway, I have, various times in history, made characters that were something like your examples. Especially when starting out. The thing that happens, often enough, goes something like this. We start here: <br/><br/>Nadir Hazer<br/>An Elven Asshole, Master (3)<br/>Pool 6<br/>He has an old Three-Corner magic staff that he created a hundred years ago. Currently a swashbuckler sort, uses memories of past lives to operate the staff.<br/><br/>Then as we play, and the character sticks around and starts getting more details and more screen time it starts to look like this: <br/><br/>Nadir Hazer<br/>Elven Adversary (In the Biblical Sense), Master (3) -- though weak on empathy and not a good public speaker<br/>Pool 6 (probably lower on vigor than instinct) <br/>He has an old Three-Corner magic staff that he created in one of his past lives, before the moon went boom. The staff gives him amazing abilities with destructive magic, but seems to actively hinder his ability to engage with creation magics -- possibly due to resonance. Currently he's a swashbuckler sort, and though he's dangerous both with sword and magic (uses MPL to use the staff) he lacks panache and flexibility in fast moving situations, and is less a tactician than a strategist. <br/><br/>And then as we play more and more, and the character sticks around and has like.. I dunno, probably 20 or so hours of "screen time" he starts to look like this: <br/><br/>Nadir Hazer<br/>Elven Child Roland, Master (3) -- though weak on empathy and not a good public speaker, strong personal charisma on the one on one level, is a very good clock maker and has recently taken up blacksmithing<br/>Pool 6 (probably lower on vigor than instinct, much higher on reason) <br/>He has an old Three-Corner magic staff that he created in one of his past lives, before the moon went boom. The staff gives him amazing abilities with destructive magic, but actively hinders his ability to engage with creation magics -- possibly due to resonance. Currently he's a swashbuckler sort, and though he's dangerous both with sword and magic (uses MPL to use the staff) he lacks panache and flexibility in fast moving situations, and is less a tactician than a strategist. He's almost impervious to mental influence, and has shown himself difficult to surprise. <br/><br/>At which point, really, I might as well write him out the same way PCs are written out. The skills, the levels of resistance abilities, the different pool levels, some of the secrets... they're all there. They've all been important to play. They effect and affect the way the players interact with him, how they plan for or against him, how they situate him in their heads in the game world. <br/><br/>I probably could still just keep all that as color details for narration, or to help me decide when to assign pool dice to rolls or something -- but that feels flat. At the point I'm doing that I have to wonder why the players aren't doing it too. <br/><br/>Now, this raises the obvious question of whether or not I stat-block him out fully before I start playing. After all, the example I just used started off with a simple stat block and then added layers of detail as play went on, rather than starting out fully stated. <br/><br/>There are three answers to that question, two of which are different in process but similar in result, and one of which isn't. The first two are that sometimes I start with the simple stat block -- especially in games where I've no idea who the "important NPCs" are going to be -- and only upgrade to full statblocks either as I go (in systems like WoD, where you can assign dots until you run out, or similar things), or once the NPC reaches a certain density level that makes it seem less hassle to actually use the stats than to try to remember all the details without the framework of the game to aid as a mnemonic. (Much as it does for me when I play.) The second is that I sometimes do make up a full stat block for NPCs I suspect/know (depending on the level of "Gm runs the game' in the social contract for the event) will be important, but that I treat it rather loosely, or leave it only partly complete, until things actually come up in play. (No Myth NPCs, I guess.) <br/><br/>Both of those methods mean different amounts of prep, but have a similar effect in that NPCs only get to the stat-fixed-defined level of PCs after they've had enough screen time and emotional weight in the story to justify it. In the second method, there is often some psychological aspect of it for me -- as you ask, it is beneficial to expressing the character in play. The process of detailing the character (with a system that details characters in a way I find useful for portrayal, a big issue that we've not touched on) does, in fact, ready me to play the character. Much as it does when I'm a player, I guess. And yes, in both cases, I do use the numbers for something -- the characters, over time, have shown a level of detail and nuance that clearly shows their stats, and it starts to feel illusionary and fragile if they don't have them. (I have, in fact, had players in the past get upset in games where they found out their antagonists weren't actually statted -- they said it felt illusionist, or at least with the strong possibility of becoming so.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208955/#Comment_208955" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-25T09:00:11+00:00" title="May 25, 2009  9:00AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (cont) <br/><br/><br/>The third method is to full stat the NPC ahead of time and not leave it flexible. I do this pretty rarely these days, and mostly only for short run games with a high level of gamist bent where there is going to be a kind of tactical and strategic play off of resources between PCs and NPCs that makes it more of a fair shake to everyone if everyone is using a very similar (comparable if not identical) build system. In these cases I get many of the same benefits as in the previous two, but with the added layer of certainty against "making it up to make the best story as I went" in a game where that is either not the agenda or against the agenda.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emprint" title="Emprint"><img alt="Emprint" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emprint">Emprint</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208956/#Comment_208956" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-25T09:03:36+00:00" title="May 25, 2009  9:03AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 25, 2009 9:03AM by Emprint.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jarvis</cite>Default successes fail when a PC switches to a Dodge action (double Defense) or something similar.

All major NPCs do not roll, they simply have "Numbers" (I forget now, but IIRC it was Physical, Mental and Combat). So it is assumed that the NPC simply rolls that result Every Time.<br/><br/>So to apply that to NPCs in nWOD, you could create a character like this:<br/><br/><b>Bruiser Vampire</b><br/>Fighting Ability: 4<br/>Non-fighting Ability: 2<br/><br/>Where the number above is not the number of dice the GM rolls. Instead, it is the number of successes that the NPC gets, to every roll in that domain. 4 success attacks, 4 success defends, 4 successes to resist Blood Boil, etc. 2 Successes to resist charm, or to charm another, and so on.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208971/#Comment_208971" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-25T10:56:09+00:00" title="May 25, 2009 10:56AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm, that would certainly be easy and fast, Andy, but personally I don't think I like it.

A GM can roleplay the actions of an NPC, or pass the NPC to a player not in the scene; that character might have life, goals, and a strong and interesting personality... but those Set Numbers mean that the real focus of the game is never taken away from the PCs (they may win, they may lose, but they are always center stage).  I thought it took some real balls to reduce even major NPCs to No-Roll Success Numbers.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209026/#Comment_209026" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-25T19:25:33+00:00" title="May 25, 2009  7:25PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>focused on the PCs, All The Time.</blockquote>That's true.  And I definitely agree that it would be a great thing to do in certain games or in certain styles of game.  I don't, however, think it's appropriate for every game, and I suspect it's not appropriate for my current game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/simjames" title="simjames"><img alt="simjames" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i41.tinypic.com/14kutg3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/simjames">simjames</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209041/#Comment_209041" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-26T02:35:22+00:00" title="May 26, 2009  2:35AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I used full statblocks when I used to run Wraith and Victorian Age: Vampire, as it added to the verisimilitude for me back then. I had a folder of the most important NPCs, of whoch there could easily be fifty in a campaign, plus some generic characters (generic cop, generic vampire, generic Spectre, what-have-you).<br/><br/>These days, my preferences have shifted, and the simpler "two stats" method looks appealing. Heck, building Wild Talents NPCs with a heavy reliance on hard and wiggle dice (perhaps with a Willpower cost to use certain powers) would certainly help when you've got multiple supervillains against the PCs. I'm not a fan of using more than one Worthy Oppponent in ORE games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
