(I think once our resolution mechanic was "Draw a Tarot card and interpret it.) Our only two-player roleplaying session that was actually play, rather than brainstorming, was D&amp;D Basic when I found my Moldvay Red Box while cleaning out the spare bedroom.<br/><br/>So I'm thinking, hey maybe some simple freeform on a D&amp;D base, or The Pool, or something. I'm pretty open.<br/><br/>She starts with <i>Doctor Who</i> and over the course of twenty minutes she's envisioned a Time Agency type of situation where multiple parallel futures are tinkering with the past to make one of them "really" happen. There's nuggets about things like "You have to leap forward in large chunks, recrossing your timeline is very dangerous" and "Trust no one, not even yourself", and I throw her a kind of neat idea about how it's maybe okay to cross your own timeline as long as you're so heavily disguised that the "past you" doesn't know you're their future self. Just sort of bouncing ideas around.<br/><br/>She hares off on this tangent that is very much more scenario than concept, and I'm thinking "Well dear, you're kind of off track but I'm gonna get bonked on the nose if I stop you", so I go into "intently listening" mode. She's latched on to this idea of a third-act betrayal that's predicated on the nature of time travel in this setting meaning that it's much safer to do things if even the people who are helping you do them, don't know exactly what change you're making. There's a fellow time agent undercover as a homeless guy at the "drop point" and a lot of detail. At this point, I'm just plain out of my element.<br/><br/>She was a bit bummed at the final outcome, which was me saying "I hate to say this, but my brain isn't fast enough today to contribute." I <i>never</i> do that -- that's the line she feeds me when I start babbling about dice mechanics and narrational authority. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>So I'm dinking around the web afterwards and I bump into <a href="http://jeepen.org/games/soap/" rel="nofollow">A Freeform Soap Opera</a>. One of the things she was kicking around was the idea of time limits (real physical time limits, not "6 second turns" or what have you) to decide and declare your actions, so hey, maybe something in there will click with her.<br/><br/>And then... we get into a long discussion where I realize that she pretty much is a Jeeper. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Well, I don't know if that's actually true, but it turns out that simple little game there hits all her buttons in terms of the way she thinks about roleplaying, more than any of the "game" bits I've ever thrown her way when we brainstorm this stuff.<br/><br/>Then she pretty much hits me over the head with The Lumpley Principle, which she hasn't read. To paraphrase her: "Look, I know that <i>you</i> enjoy the fiddly mechanical bits, but when we're actually playing, it's all about the policies we use to turn our ideas into 'what really happens'. That's the kind of stuff I've always meant when I said 'mechanics', so no wonder we're never on the same page."<br/><br/>I was like, wow, I'm not nearly as smart as I think I am. It was a pretty cool moment, actually. <br/><br/>So now I feel like I need to actually <i>read</i> all that damn Nordic scene stuff! In the past, I went, "Well, immersion is totally not a priority for me, so I can safely ignore that stuff." Now I can't. <br/><br/>Erin's always been a genius with logistics and how social dynamics and relationships translate into actually getting shit done. At work, when we were playing World of Warcraft, throwing a dinner party, any of that -- she knows that stuff cold. So when she tells me, hey, man, the rest of the group wouldn't care if we used a coin-toss or GM Fiat as a resolution mechanic, the real meat of the game is in how you structure the social dynamic -- I have to listen.<br/><br/>So... I don't have a particular direction in mind for this thread, but I'd absolutely love people's thoughts!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd" title="SweeneyTodd"><img alt="SweeneyTodd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd">SweeneyTodd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151339/#Comment_151339" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-18T07:38:01+00:00" title="June 18, 2008  7:38AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2008 7:40AM by SweeneyTodd.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To clarify, when we finished brainstorming the time travel idea, she wrapped up with "Obviously at this point this is a scenario, not a full game." Something in my subconscious pointed me back to Jeepform when she said that, and lo and behold, she'd totally written a Jeep scenario (as far as I could tell.)<br/><br/>To give an idea of her take on mechanics, she thought FATE was extremely heavyweight. That's strictly as it applies to roleplaying; when she plays her Hunter in World of Warcraft, she loves things like looking over statistical reports after a fight to see how close her play was to theoretical maximum performance. <br/><br/>My first take-home lesson, I think, is that I've been trying to drive play through mechanics that do "directed play" and "fruitful void" kind of stuff; if the game's theme is X, then that means Y is governed by mechanics, and Z is very much handled through social dynamics.<br/><br/>What she basically told me was that mechanics have only ever directed play in our games to the extent that they made me, Andrew, do that. The way I arrived at wanting to push Y and not push Z was totally arbitrary from her perspective -- if for each scenario I'd written down a few things that <i>were</i> going to happen, the experience might have looked exactly the same to everybody but me. <br/><br/>None of this was criticism on either of our parts. She said, "Hey, we enjoy the games we play because <i>you</i> run them a certain way. We don't really care how you get there." But man, what an eye-opener, especially when it comes to the game designs I've been kicking around in my head. I have <b>always</b> fought against the "If you have a good GM, the rules don't matter" approach to RPGs, but she made me reformulate it as "If you have a good social dynamic and set approach to play, that <i>is</i> the rules", and she convinced me of it to boot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_151342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151342/#Comment_151342" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-18T07:40:05+00:00" title="June 18, 2008  7:40AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No direction to my answer, only a thought on the fly: nice to see you getting a beating over elements of play that has been more or less overlooked by designers within the classical paradigm since the birth of RPGs, and nice to see that you get it!

That and debates about whether or not the advice the book gives on the mindset you should have going in, as a group, is just advice, or rules. I think those are actually rules, now, and I don't know why I think that but I just do. It's intended for small-group heroic fantasy, with tactical combat, and trying to use it for something else is almost nonsensical. It says that's what it's for. Why was that always obvious to me in a way that my wife's take on <i>all</i> gaming wasn't?<br/><br/>- I haven't read In A Wicked Age (so people please correct me if I go off-base), but I've read a bunch of the threads about it. My naive take on the controversy with that game is that a lot of people have said "This game presupposes a certain social dynamic in your group, and if you don't have that, it doesn't seem to work right." I felt like Vincent got some flak for not including some things in the book as rules that really aren't rules, they're an overall approach to how the group social dynamics work. So, if you <i>were</i> going to publish the social dynamics to go along with that... how the hell would you do that?<br/><br/>- FATE worked really well for our longest-running campaign. All we really ever used, though, were Aspect invocations and compels. I totally get why, now. We boiled the system down to "Write some stuff on an index card. You will get a lot of mileage out of that stuff, whether it be by using it, or getting screwed over by it."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151358/#Comment_151358" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-18T08:07:02+00:00" title="June 18, 2008  8:07AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SweeneyTodd</cite>Yeah, seriously, Tomas -- I've hollered at "those damn Nords" forever!

We don't really care how you get there."</blockquote>\nIt's funny, my personal take from my time on the Forge back in the day was that I wanted to get away from that. The idea that a given RPG is good "with the right GM"... that's a sign of failure, because your game doesn't do what it says it does.<br/><br/>My head-slapping realization is that yes, that's true, for a game <i>designer</i>. It's not bad in and of itself. I've never considered writing a game just for one campaign, with particular players in mind, that will only work as envisioned with those particular people, but actually now that sounds like it would be pretty interesting. <br/><br/>Oh, another "years later" realization I just had. I ran online D&amp;D games using Neverwinter Nights with a group of folks back in grad school. Typically we'd have two or three, sometimes four GMs, and 4-6 players. The "dungeon crawl" and "fight scene" bits were by the book and pretty brutally difficult. The rest of the game, though, upon reflection, was a damn MMO-LARP. A GM would possess an NPC, say "What's my motivation", and get into a conversation with the PCs. We had in-game tools that allowed us to change the game world and do special effects, so these scenes weren't just talking, but they were absolutely freeform roleplaying. And they were immensely successful. No one, especially the GMs, ever really had an idea as to how things were going to turn out. So while I can say I don't like immersive freeform play till I'm blue in the face, oops, I've done a ton of it and enjoyed it. <br/><br/>(I think the fact that we had OOC voice chat, and separate IC and OOC chat channels in game, made it much easier for me to immerse in character. When I have to "act" in a traditional sense, I freeze up.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151365/#Comment_151365" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-18T08:33:48+00:00" title="June 18, 2008  8:33AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SweeneyTodd</cite>I've never considered writing a game just for one campaign, with particular players in mind, that will only work as envisioned with those particular people, but actually now that sounds like it would be pretty interesting.</blockquote>\nLately I've started suspecting that this is actually the <i>best</i> way to write games, for an actual audience, not an imaginary one that exists out there somewhere.

The way it's often codified is stuff like <i>Robin's Laws</i>, which I always read as "If your player fits into this broad stereotype, pander to them (in 1-2 scenes per session) in this fashion", which always offended me. But the underlying idea that "there's no such thing as a canned game, you must adapt it", that's gold.<br/><br/>That's not to say that a lot of indie games don't address this -- but they way they do so is often Fruitful Void stuff. I wonder, does it spoil the Fruitful Void concept to say "Okay, here it is, I'm <i>The Mountain Witch</i>, there is no Trust mechanic, and here's why"? <br/><br/>Seems like I need to read <i>Polaris</i> because that appears to be a game where the "Do this at the table, now do this, now do this" is formalized but that expressly does not try to make every table play the game the same way. Certain processes are always carried out in the same fashion, but what's informing the use of those processes is different per table, maybe?<br/><br/>Apologies if this is sounding like a blog instead of a thread. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marco" title="Marco"><img alt="Marco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marco">Marco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151380/#Comment_151380" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-18T09:01:08+00:00" title="June 18, 2008  9:01AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite><cite>Posted By: SweeneyTodd</cite>I've never considered writing a game just for one campaign, with particular players in mind, that will only work as envisioned with those particular people, but actually now that sounds like it would be pretty interesting.</blockquote>\nLately I've started suspecting that this is actually the<i>best</i>way to write games, for an actual audience, not an imaginary one that exists out there somewhere.

(Isn't that the Corley Conjecture, or something?). Every game is built for the actual players, by the actual players. But... so what? What's the take-home application of this? Is it: "design social interactions along with mechanics?" Sure, that's one answer. Or is it: "actual players won't use what you put in the text (as it pertains to imaginative content or social structure) anyway, so just give them a resolution mechanic and stand clear?" Yeah, that's a fair answer too. The most common answer seems to be: "Just rely on the common 'folk wisdom' of 'how to play' and slap some new imaginative content on it." And that's probably good advice for making <b>product</b>, but not so much for anything I'd recognize as design.<br/><br/>I think the real answer is: given this insight, there are as many working ways to play as there are groups and 'scenarios'. Designers provide examples, at best, of one way to get a given experience. The greatest value of designing new games is to provide examples of <b>new</b> models, not to elaborate continuously on the edges of "how it's done." <br/><br/>Of course, this tends to provoke howls of outrage from those whose identity is invested in their mastery of their particular "how it's done". All they really want from a new game is more fuel for their existing methods.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Merten" title="Merten"><img alt="Merten" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://merten.kapsi.fi/pics/fiat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Merten">Merten</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151391/#Comment_151391" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-18T09:25:14+00:00" title="June 18, 2008  9:25AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SweeneyTodd</cite>I have<b>always</b>fought against the "If you have a good GM, the rules don't matter" approach to RPGs, but she made me reformulate it as "If you have a good social dynamic and set approach to play, that<i>is</i>the rules", and she convinced me of it to boot.</blockquote>\nYour wife: smart. A potential problem might be that the prequsite for such condition is a group or pool of people who've played together for a long time, or for some other can adapt to the social dynamics and share the similar approaches to play.

In doing so, I was trying to capture something of the social dynamic that is required to make the game work.<br/><br/>In <i>A Flower for Mara</i> (which is my forthcoming Jeepish game), it's been even harder. How do you say, "Just play nice together"? Honestly, part of what I'm planning is making videos of a game available so people can see how it's done.

I'm very much into gaming with strangers, and instructing other how to game with strangers (and having great games with them). My take is: people are similar in a lot of ways. We respond to instructions and priming/conditions in very much the same way. This makes effective design for the general public possible, even within the paradigm of <i>modern "method-based" games</i> (different from the classical mechanical-based games).<br/><br/>To tell someone that your game will be played with an initial ritual, f.ex., is part of a method where the game hinges on players diving into a certain mood to actually "get" the game. To make players touch in certain ways, is another way of inducing certain reactions/relations. To set the game-session in a murky garage makes for different interaction than if you set it in a cozy living-room. There are tools upon tools for your use, most of them fairly simple, if you want to design games that effectively influence how players actually behave in them, games which bring the players into the "other place" where the gameplay is a magic experience of transcendence and happiness.<br/><br/>Look into pagan rituals, Sweeney, and modern research on social dynamics and priming. Look into psychological systems and all other stuff relating to the hows and whys of human behavior.<br/><br/>We've only just begun scratching the surface of possibilities here ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151584/#Comment_151584" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-19T04:28:57+00:00" title="June 19, 2008  4:28AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problem with saying "no one is going to read my rules / advice on where to play, who to play with, how to play with them, so why put them in?" is that you can get left with a set of game mechanics that assume a certain sort of play and just don't work without them.<br/><br/>Back to the mention of IAWA above. The introduction there is clear that you should be playing with a small group of close friends, in a relaxed and adult atmosphere, with wine (is the wine optional?). That is the context for which the rules were written. If you play with a group of 19 year olds you don't know, in a crowded room at a convention, with everyone pumped on caffeine, will the game still work? Will the negotiation mechanics produce satisfying play if everyone is a hyped up nerd out to beat the other players (rather than the other characters)?<br/><br/>The answer in IAWA's specific case might be yes or no, but it seems obvious to me that for some games the answer must surely be, no, they don't work at all without the right people, or setting, or atmosphere, or approach to how you discuss things. Which in turn, for those games, makes that stuff just as much rules on how to play as any dice rolling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151782/#Comment_151782" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-20T01:10:05+00:00" title="June 20, 2008  1:10AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andrew, allow me to thank you for this thread.
