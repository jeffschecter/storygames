It's pretty different from what you're describing here, though:<br/><br/><b>Dungeonhearts: Youth on the Borderlands</b><br/><br/><i>You are all monsters, outcasts, runaways, the disturbed, and the abandoned. You don\u2019t really remember whose idea it was to hole up in the abandoned school way out on the outskirts of town, but it has become your home, full of seemingly endless corridors, old classrooms, underground maintenance tunnels, random oddments, and the occasional priceless treasure (a diary, a love letter, a photograph). There you live in a micro-society full of ambitions, petty rivalries, romances, crises, want, and excesses.<br/><br/>You may despise some of the others, but there are bigger threats that drive you together: true monstrosities looking to take advantage of a bunch of street kids with nowhere else to go. They share this underworld with you, but you avoid them when you can and run like hell when you see them coming. There are monsters and then there are monsters.<br/><br/>Occasionally, the braver kids with \u201cnormal\u201d lives band together in makeshift groups and venture into your domain, sometimes armed with sticks and bats, sometimes just with eyes that you could get lost in and skin that smells like dreams. You call them \u201cthe Adventurous,\u201d and despite your desire to befriend them, to become intimate with them, to drive them away before they draw the attention of real sociopaths or come to harm in this dungeon... you\u2019re a monster and, in the end, you can\u2019t help but destroy them.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mostlyjoe" title="mostlyjoe"><img alt="mostlyjoe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/285/nVQ8MX37HELA3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mostlyjoe">mostlyjoe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418806/#Comment_418806" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-22T11:44:00+00:00" title="July 22, 2013 11:44AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, ya.

The *World games are explicitly non-fiddly, fiction-first, open-ended games; I can't even really imagine anything LESS like the ultra-fiddly/grindy/unlock-preset-option, hyper-mechanical style of JRPGs and dating sims. (Which, incidentally, I totally enjoy playing.)<br/><br/>So yes, the content of the two seems to match up perfectly, but the games themselves seem miles apart to me. That doesn't mean it wouldn't be a really interesting project to try and fit them together; there's a lot of different approaches that could be fun, the most straightforward of which would be to just play a either/or mashup of the two games (i.e. each character has both a Monsterhearts Skin/character sheet AND a Dungeon World class/character sheet, and you just switch between the two based on where the fiction is at), where you just stick entirely with the *World approach to actual gameplay and don't worry at all about replicating the mechanical feel of the JRPG genre. It would just be a sort of fictional conceit/premise, nothing more.<br/><br/>But you could in theory also try to add custom moves/systems to each game in order to replicate some of the dating sim/JRPG elements (creative use of Strings/Hold/bonds comes to mind.)<br/><br/>Really though, if I wanted to make a *World game inspired by the genre(s) you're talking about, I would write a totally new hack, and I'm guessing it would look almost nothing like either Monsterhearts or Dungeon World.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418832/#Comment_418832" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-22T16:52:25+00:00" title="July 22, 2013  4:52PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you explain in a little more detail what a "dating sim" is like?

I intend to make my own so you'd think I'd be able to put it succinctly.<br/><br/>A dating sim typically sets it up in one of two ways: Branching storylines or stat-building. Many blend both, but they generally lean more towards one or the other.<br/><br/>In a branching storyline, you're given choices about what to do/how to respond to a situation and through choosing (for example) whether to shout at someone, apologize to them, or run away, it affects which branch of the story you're shown until you've worked your way through the story to its ending. (Which may be "good endings" [established relationship with your chosen love-interest], "bad endings" [death], or "neutral endings" [friendship endings].)<br/><br/>In stat-building, you typically perform activities that improve/detract from stats (for example, "Charisma" or "Polite Speech", and even your specific relationship with a character - the specific stats will vary) either visibly (you know that doing this activity has improved this stat and made you worse at that stat) or behind the scenes (often relationship stats are invisible stats - so you don't know that in spite of Haruka's stony gaze, they actually liked what you said). There are usually different "checkpoints" in the game where it will assess if you have the correct scores in different stats and then branch the storyline based on those checks. (For example: if the story is trying to find love while preparing for the Halloween dance, the first checkpoint might be "Charisma 8" and "Neighbor 4" which affects whether or not you have high enough Charisma and a high enough relationship with your neighbor with the scary Victorian house to use the house for the party. If you don't have the necessary Charisma, you might fail and the story ends, you might be branched off into a storyline where you don't use the creepy old house, or you might still have the party take place at the house but you take penalties to your relationship scores with people.) The endings are basically the same as strictly branching storylines, it's just a matter of what affects how you get to good/bad/neutral endings.<br/><br/>It might help a bit if I toss a link to you to a game:  <br/><a href="http://www.sakevisual.com/realistair/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.sakevisual.com/realistair/</a> Free game and one I enjoyed. It's of a stat-builder type, though it does have a bit of storyline branching based on choices made. <br/><a href="http://risamo.cyanide-tea.net/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://risamo.cyanide-tea.net/</a> Another free game that I enjoyed. If I remember correctly, it's entirely branching storyline. <br/><br/><br/>On-topic, I'm very interested in a game like what's being described by the OP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mostlyjoe" title="mostlyjoe"><img alt="mostlyjoe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/285/nVQ8MX37HELA3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mostlyjoe">mostlyjoe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418857/#Comment_418857" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-23T03:25:38+00:00" title="July 23, 2013  3:25AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ICE, you are not wrong.

Mind you, the dating RPG sims I'm referencing have a lot of...hmmm, misogyny issues that honestly I'd rather avoid emulating. (See Ar Tonelico's implications of date rape mind diving...it's rather umm. Sure the main character in the first game is the heroic dip, but still dude, get a clue what you are doing to those girls.) Ahem. In the end, I think I'd rather emulate a mix of harem anime wackiness with dungeon crawling fun. Maybe if you have a stronger relationship with girl/guy x you unlock a special attack combo you two can do in a fight. OR....perhaps you get situation combo bonuses when doing things like casting magic, or fighting back to back. Dunno.<br/><br/>I think ICE may be right that I'll have to hack my own game out of the mess. A JRPG with social romantic elements tied in.

Anyways, there are a few games that follow the sort of system dynamic you're talking about (Bliss Stage comes to mind), where social play and elseworld-combat feed back into each other. If you keep that border very explicit in the fiction (didn't the Persona games feature like a literal high school that was also literally a portal to demonic dungeons?) then lots of simple MH/DW interactions come to mind. Things like 'advances in MH let you buy moves in DW', or 'Sex Moves in MH unlock unique special moves in DW' or whatever.<br/><br/>But I think the main challenge is going to be making the genre work for a party of PCs, rather than a single-dude-with-agency-and-his-many-friends. If you want to have custom moves and such for a variety of interactions, that's going to be a whole lot of custom moves pretty fast -- then again, using DW's monster moves for inspiration (my impression is they can be quite free-form/fictional) could make this easier than I am imagining.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JoshDemers" title="JoshDemers"><img alt="JoshDemers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/703/nLX7QIP4KZECH.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JoshDemers">JoshDemers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418921/#Comment_418921" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-23T18:03:14+00:00" title="July 23, 2013  6:03PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the idea of "combos" is awesome.

I'd think that it might work with the Advancements. You can have X number of bonds to start off with (perhaps <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23players&amp;Mode=like">#players</a> (including GM) - 2? So if you had a game of 2 players and the GM, that's 1 bond). Then as you Advance, one of the Advancements you can take is extra bonds. Being able to change the nature of these bonds should be thought of too - perhaps either after you've used the bond power or between sessions. I was also thinking that as you play towards these bonds, you're building up some sort of Overdrive power. And that the Overdrive power would tie to the <i>type</i> of bond you had with the other character. (Rivalry might let you do something more impressive than the person you're a rival with - so maybe it's an automatic success on your next roll as long as it's made after the rival's. Friendship might let you give your friend an automatic success if they're in the scene with you.) Etc.<br/><br/>I also was thinking that perhaps the playbooks/skins could be created based on dating sim character type tropes. For example, the Plucky Heroine might have a move that allows her to take +1 forward on her current goal if she takes a Harm (ex: She gets knocked down and takes a harm trying to grab the villain's staff. If she gets up and tries again, she has a +1 forward to grabbing it this time). Or maybe the Gentle Healer type may be able to remove 1 harm on a 7-9 and 2 harm on a 10+. <br/><br/>After thinking it over, I also would prefer to shy away from a strict harem or reverse-harem scenario. I'd, of course, want that to be one of the <i>options</i> of play, but setting it up so that it's the default... I'm not sure how to voice this without provoking some sort of, "Trust the players." counter-argument, but I am leery of the idea of it attracting the sorts of players who need to be the center of the story at all times. It would also limit (to one degree or another) alternate types of love-polygons. <br/><br/>Just some of my thoughts - of course, if they don't fit with what is being gone for, no worries. xD                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jacob" title="Jacob"><img alt="Jacob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jacob">Jacob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418951/#Comment_418951" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-24T11:42:28+00:00" title="July 24, 2013 11:42AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wanna see a game where you play a bunch of townsfolk who profit off of, swindle, and maybe fall in love with the adventurers who use the town as their base camp as they explore the nearby ruins.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419064/#Comment_419064" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-26T05:59:52+00:00" title="July 26, 2013  5:59AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I wanna see a game where you play a bunch of townsfolk who profit off of, swindle, and maybe fall in love with the adventurers who use the town as their base camp as they explore the nearby ruins. </blockquote>\nJacob, do you know Kagematsu?<br/><br/>mostlyjoe, maybe you should try to make a forum microgame (a la The Sundered Land) to find the best dynamics and topics for your idea!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419106/#Comment_419106" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-27T11:42:15+00:00" title="July 27, 2013 11:42AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>In the end, I think I'd rather emulate a mix of harem anime wackiness with dungeon crawling fun.

That emulates nicely the kind of interaction you see in many kinds of action + romance stories. Guy saves girl from eminent harm, guy impresses the heck out of girl and gets her attention (or visa versa).<br/><br/>It would be easy to overdo, though. So maybe the relationship building part of the move would only work once per character per session. Or maybe it's part of a list of effects, so you can only really afford to take that one when you have an exceptional success (or if you take the harm or whatever that's implied in the other choices).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419190/#Comment_419190" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-29T11:42:13+00:00" title="July 29, 2013 11:42AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It can be an end-of-the-session question, too:<br/><br/>"Who went out of their way to protect you when you were in trouble?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419192/#Comment_419192" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-29T11:58:44+00:00" title="July 29, 2013 11:58AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I could be at the end of the session.<br/><br/>However, as a person who plays convention one-shots of games a lot more than campaigns, I'd rather see a mechanic that triggered during the session, rather than in the pre-game post-game part.<br/><br/>Plus, to me, the pre-game post-game stuff is separate. That's more where I want lonely fun stuff. And it seems counterintuitive to me to place relationship mechanics in the lonely fun section. Relationships with other PCs should evolve right there in the middle of play, not between play.<br/><br/>The fact that most of the stuff relating to Bonds takes place in the pre-game post-game part of Dungeon World is probably the thing that excites me the least about the game. But I look at it as "Hey, at least they made character interactions into something mechanically meaningful in the game. That's something, at least." But I would rather it was something more dynamic and chewy, like Hx or Strings.<br/><br/>For a -Hearts game, a stronger relationship mechanic than DW's Bonds is pretty essential, I'd think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419193/#Comment_419193" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-29T12:13:47+00:00" title="July 29, 2013 12:13PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're up to the challenge, I think it would be interesting to write an anime inspired action+romance hack in 3 modes:<br/><br/>Harem mode - The PCs are all the same gender preference and are all trying to impress/protect/seduce/etc. an NPC of the target gender.<br/>Mixed mode - The PCs are a mixed group in a web of messy relationships with each other and with NPCs. (the most like Monsterhearts)<br/>Solo mode - Inverse of harem mode. There's one PC who is trying to impress/protect/seduce/etc. a series of NPCs and perhaps maintain multiple relationships among them before possibly choosing one to marry or whatever.<br/><br/>And maybe a 4th mode:<br/>Star mode - Harem and Solo mode together. One player is the star and is the object of affection for all the other players.<br/><br/>At the very least, figuring out which of these modes of play you're going to try to support and which you are not supporting will be an important early design decision. Things like relationship meter mechanics might have drastically different meanings depending on the mode.<br/><br/>In harem mode or solo mode, for example, maxing out a relationship meter may mean you have permanently solidified a relationship, where in mixed or star mode, you probably wouldn't want it to be that proscriptive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mostlyjoe" title="mostlyjoe"><img alt="mostlyjoe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/285/nVQ8MX37HELA3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mostlyjoe">mostlyjoe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419197/#Comment_419197" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-29T13:16:15+00:00" title="July 29, 2013  1:16PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd try to avoid pure-harem play.

I have a hunch that you could almost directly mash up all the rules and play "as is", so long as you keep the two "spheres" separate.<br/><br/>Perhaps equate every two or three points of damage with one "level of harm", and then use Monsterhearts rules for PC damage but DW rules for monster damage. <br/><br/>Let each character take two playbooks: a Monsterhearts playbook and a Dungeon World playbook, and pick half the number of moves from each or something like that. So you could have a Fae who's a Paladin, or a Vampire who's a Thief, and so on.<br/><br/>I haven't thought it through entirely, but it seems to me there would only be a handful of sticking points, which would be fairly easy to smooth over (like the hit points/harm conversion).<br/><br/>If that's too tricky, then simplify a little more and have two types of scenes: "Personal scenes" and "Dungeon scenes", with some way to decide when each happens. Personal scenes would be kind of like refreshment scenes in Lady Blackbird/TSoY, except they would happen more often. In Personal scenes you use the Monsterhearts playbooks and rules; in Dungeon scenes you use the DW rules. Think of it as slapping a different colour filter over the movie footage, or changing the soundtrack in the background.<br/><br/>Maybe the scenes alternate, or players can take turns calling for which kind of scene they want next. (So they could, if they chose, play out a dungeon combat scene as a Personal scene, or vice-versa.) Or maybe "changing the filter" is just something you add to the list of MC Moves, and the MC brings that in whenever she wishes.<br/><br/>Of course, you can still use your Strings in Dungeon scenes, though! Many of the moves and rules could be used in "inappropriate" scenes, just for fun and genre-mixing, as long as it makes sense. Why not turn someone on while they're trying to disarm a trap?<br/><br/>Each character would have two sets of stats and moves and everything: so you could potentially have complex characters who are very Strong but not at all Volatile or vice-versa.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419443/#Comment_419443" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-02T12:25:45+00:00" title="August  2, 2013 12:25PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'd try to avoid pure-harem play.</blockquote>Mostly I was wanting to throw some terminology out to make sure we are differentiating our apples from our oranges in talking about different sorts of relationship groupings.<br/><br/>In calling out Harem, I wanted to differentiate between that and Star.
