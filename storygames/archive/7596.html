An acquaintance of mine (read: someone I've had heated forum discussions with) is a dyed in the wool traditional gamer, the majority of his rpg experience is with White Wolf and D&amp;D 3.x.  Since our rather animated discussions, I've been slowly trying to introduce him to storygames concepts. One that really piqued his interest is the Scene Economy.<br/><br/>The example I used was from the Grey Ranks game I played last night. He sounded really intrigued by the idea. So, what are some other examples of games with a scene economy?<br/><br/>The only two I can think of off the top of my head are Burning Empires and Grey Ranks. Can anyone contribute a few more examples?<br/><br/>Also, what are your thoughts on Scene Economies? Are the too constricting? Do they tighten up the narrative?<br/><br/>As for myself, they're a very new idea, and I'll not deny that Burning Empire's scene economy has given me fits, but I see why it's there and I see what it becomes, it's just *getting* there that's the challenge. But that comes with experience.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168536/#Comment_168536" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-11T14:49:53+00:00" title="September 11, 2008  2:49PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What is Scene Economy?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevin.weiser" title="kevin.weiser"><img alt="kevin.weiser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.finitesite.com/spiderlegs/wlkngI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevin.weiser">kevin.weiser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168537/#Comment_168537" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-11T14:54:45+00:00" title="September 11, 2008  2:54PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, here's how I described it to him:<br/><br/>Scene economies mean each player is limited in some way to what kinds of scenes they can create for their character. In the game I played last night, each player gets a Personal scene they can create (or "frame") for their own character and one Mission scene they can frame for a different player's character. So you have to think carefully about what kinds of story elements you want to use, because you're limited on how much time in the spotlight you get.<br/><br/>My definition is up for debate, of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168540/#Comment_168540" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-11T14:59:44+00:00" title="September 11, 2008  2:59PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2008 3:04PM by Josh Roby.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Ugh, hate to say this, but can you clarify what you mean by scene economy?

PTA is the grandpappy of explicit scene framing, so while they aren't <em>quite</em> finite in any game-relevant sense, it does have players dictate the scene's Type, Set, and Agenda, so itl does a lot and goes a long way to making sure Something Gets Done Each Scene.<br/><br/><em>Full Light, Full Steam</em> has a rather loopy scene pacing mechanic where the players and only rarely the GM dictate whatever the next scene will be.  Again, there's as many scenes as you need to get to the end of the story, but when it's your scene to frame, it's a resource you control, and you never know when you'll get another one.<br/><br/><em>Capes</em> has scene-pacing rules that have crunchy mechanical goodness to them.  Again, not finite, but the honor of framing the next scene is something that the players can mechanically manipulate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevin.weiser" title="kevin.weiser"><img alt="kevin.weiser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.finitesite.com/spiderlegs/wlkngI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevin.weiser">kevin.weiser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168542/#Comment_168542" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-11T15:05:17+00:00" title="September 11, 2008  3:05PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2008 3:07PM by kevin.weiser.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suppose I mean a little bit of both.

GMs can't do just ANYthing in a game, even when they have ultimate story authority, and I don't mean that in the "hyuk hyuk the players will laeve hurr" manner that others have said. Because even someone with ultimate story authority has to make decisions. Even if I talk the whole time and "player" input is zero, we only meet four hours a week at most, and we only go through 5 or so months of play. Realistically, even with the modest player agency my group likes to have, that amount of time is cut in more than half. Probably the GM is only introducing things into the fiction 20-25 percent of the time the game is going on. (Maybe 40-50 if you count adjudicating things that are handled by a system.)<br/><br/>GMs decide what happens, and even the stuff you pre-prepare is improvised in a way, since you're not memorizing what others have written and reciting that (usually).  And what makes improvisation work? That's right. BOUNDARIES.  Limits on resources, what you can and can't say.  My Spycraft masterminds were improved greatly because I knew they had 5 henchmen, had to be level 9, had a certain amount of equipment and goons and a certain amount of crazy spy hypertech - I didn't turn to the "making up SPECTRE" section of the book and find some hippie lighting up a giant bong made of a huge d30 and saying "you can do whateeeever you want, maaaaan".  So that's why I really like scene/chapter/story economies even as someone who plays a ton of games as a wicked old regular GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

"traditional way" of having the GM choose and frame scenes as granted, without explicating it in the text. <br/><br/>Recently Paul Czege clarified that you should play MLWM without worrying so much about strict turn order (even if you should try to give anyone equal time), with the GM framing the character in scene without pre-setting what will happen, the players "playing their characters" and then use the rolls in the scene, IF and WHEN there is a conflict, to determinate the outcome of that specific conflict in that moment (moment, not scene), deciding at that moment (based on the circumstances) the kind of roll to use.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168556">\n<div

We'd find it impossible to get anything done without it, I think.<br/><br/>It is really constricting, but I find that sometimes scarcity encourages creativity and have found that this "sometimes" comes up a hell of a lot in our BE games (I think we've have one, maybe two "fizzer" sessions and that this was more due to tiredness on the part of various people at the time than problems with the scene economy).<br/><br/>I have to say I really find the Contenders-style economy interesting too. I'd like to see more games mess around with that I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168590/#Comment_168590" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-11T23:56:15+00:00" title="September 11, 2008 11:56PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't believe nobody's mentioned my beautiful <a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2007/12/28/zombie-porn/" rel="nofollow">Zombie Porn</a> yet! (Jeez, I'm going to have to rewrite the setting so that people will actually have the guts to play the game.)<br/><br/>A scene overview, from the game text:<br/><br/><b>Movie shoot scenes</b> involve two or more characters. The aim of these scenes is to build up the characters' Image. The more intact a character's body is, the greater his/her chance of shooting a good film. Movie shoots with characters they have no Love for will increase a character's angst. Primadonnas will increase their Image fast, but their Love will cool off quickly.<br/>Inside every player there's a porn director throbbing to get out! In the movie shoot scenes you show what you're good for. Give the other characters fitting costumes! Make an art film! Do your thing!<br/><br/><b>Hunting scenes </b>involve two characters. The aim is to acquire body parts \u2013 either because the character lacks a few, because they want to stop a rival from getting famous, or just because they want to build up a selection for later use. During the hunting scene the character will use their own body parts as a stake \u2013 often several times in a row. These scenes increase a character's Angst.<br/>The hunting scenes are the hardest conflict scenes in the game. Play hard. No mercy.<br/><br/><b>Love scenes </b>involve two characters. The aim is to increase the characters' mutual Love. Characters who share a lot of Love won't want to steal each others' body parts (that only causes Angst), and will enjoy doing movie shoots with each other, which will increase their Image. Without Love, Image won't help, after all. Love scenes can also decrease a character's Angst.<br/>Love doesn't have to be only for lovers. Try some scenes with respect, family love, or the love between good colleagues.<br/><br/><b>Navel gazing scenes </b>only involve one character. The aim is to show the character's fear, uncertainty and despair over the terrible choices of the porn death life. These scenes decrease a character's Angst. They can also increase the character's Love to another character, one-sidedly. Navel gazing is for great melancholical solo scenes. Play with pathos. Solitude is beautiful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168600/#Comment_168600" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-12T02:32:11+00:00" title="September 12, 2008  2:32AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I found the BE scene economy really restricting and unpleasant as well, so I know where you are coming from agony. I think boundaries do indeed enhance creativity, but those boundaries were just too much.<br/><br/>Solipsist has a partial scene economy in which certain types of scene (Thread, Limitation, Obsession) are limited per session or story regardless of who frames them (GM or player). Other types of scene are unlimited in number, though as with Full-Light Full-Steam there is no guarantee for a particular player that they will get to frame them on any particular occasion (since the person who narrated the last Change of Reality does that).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168611/#Comment_168611" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-12T05:06:06+00:00" title="September 12, 2008  5:06AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think your definition might be a bit of a red herring.  I know I've used mission scenes in <i>Grey Ranks</i> to have my dude fall in love, for example, and personal scenes to smash some Nazi faces off.  Doing this occasionally is, in fact, strictly awesome from a story perspective because of the way the dice work.  The only restriction on your character's action is group consensus.<br/><br/>My feeling is that games with well defined structures aren't any more restrictive necessarily, but they put the focus on different things.  So, big picture, you know how a game of <i>Grey Ranks</i> is going to begin, how it is going to develop, and how it is going to end.  You don't need to think about that, so that frees you up to think about other stuff, like why your guy is caught up in it, and how his own story intertwines with the fixed narrative.  It's influenced by <i>The Mountain Witch</i> in a big way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168614/#Comment_168614" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-12T05:31:06+00:00" title="September 12, 2008  5:31AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Tblisi, the GM pays tokens from a pool to create scenes. These can be a challenge, a conflict or an exploration scene (actually I don't think I called it exploration but I don't have the text with me). Each has a different resolution mechanism.<br/><br/>3:16 has different kinds of scenes, but not for the whole scene. Combat scenes can become flashbacks which can either remove one character or the whole group from the combat.<br/><br/>Nicotine Girls has Smokes and Acts of Evil has several different kinds of scene, each of which has a set resolution mechanism.<br/><br/>Scene Economy is a weird term, it makes me think of currency but it has nothing to do with this.

There's not much of a complete economic engine -- like, say, how one earns and spends Artha or Fate -- in how these scene mechanics work.<br/><br/>Scene budgets are very, very authorial-style tools IMO. BE's scene budget was a 100% failure for two players in my first group. Over and over again they wanted to be able to do what they wanted to do, and there was this "weird" limitation on that that just didn't click. But for the players who got that the economy was there to create a specific play effect, and even for the high-tactics players who saw the budget as one more tool in their arsenal, they couldn't see playing w/o the budget. We ran a second campaign with folks who had 100% buy-in and it was one of the best games I've ever participated in.<br/><br/>It's funny that the budget-haters don't have the same problem with i-go-u-go initiative schemes in traditional RPGs: "What do you mean I have to wait 'til everyone else does something? That's so limiting!" :-D<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168620/#Comment_168620" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-12T07:44:42+00:00" title="September 12, 2008  7:44AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kevin,<br/><br/>My game (<a href="http://misspentyouthgame.com" rel="nofollow">Misspent Youth</a>) has a strong scene economy.

One of the areas I think game design needs to improve on is providing session structure. Many times I'll be running a game and get pretty frustrated with the blank-page problem.
