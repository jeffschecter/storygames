                    In this <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=157" rel="nofollow">other thread</a> Ross mentioned playing some kind of bathhouse-gone-wrong vampire game for 19 hours, for which I respect and honor him.  <br/><br/>What's the longest you've played a single game continuously, stopping only to eat and address hygenic needs?  At 14 hours long ago, I suspect I'm a lightweight.  <br/><br/>Also - why does this happen, and are there structures or techniques that support marathon play sessions?  Besides Mountain Dew?  I associate this behavior with old skool games, but I can imagine doing it with low/no-prep games like, say, Dogs or Polaris.  But what's the appeal?                </div>

                            We used to have gaming sleepover weekends.  We'd mix things up with some other stuff -- movies, food, board games -- but most of it would be dedicated to one roleplaying game.  So assuming it counts, going from Friday after school to Sunday evening is... a little over fifty hours, and say two-thirds of that was real gaming?<br/>
<br/>
I can tell you hands-down that the impetus for our marathons was to finally get to play that epic save-the-world storyline that we thought was the metric of success for roleplaying.  Later similar attempts were because it was getting so damn hard to play regularly -- the high school / college divide is killer on game groups.                        </div>

<p>I've done 6p.m. to 6a.m. for an Amber throne war I ran.  Then done it again on the anniversary (with a whole different plot but the same berserker-marathon sensibilities).</p>
<p>I <em>don't</em> recommend it.  After about 3a.m. people become noticeably less sharp.  It sucks to be getting to a dramatic climax right when everybody is barely able to keep their eyes open.</p>

                            Wow.  I haven't even come close to that.  Back in HS we used to get together every few weeks and have a Friday eve - Sunday afternoon gaming session.  Those sessions usually went late at night and started up again early in the morning.  But I don't think we ever sat in front of the books for more than... oh, I'd guess 12 or 13 hours straight.  <br/>
<br/>
And it was Shadowrun.  Oh, Shadowrun, my first love... *nostalgic sigh*<br/>

                            I'm at 12 or so hours for an overnight KULT game, the one and only time I gave my players goosebumps and seriously freaked them out. KULT by candle light is some serious fun (not in the ha-ha-fun sense, but more in the we-should-stop-before-I-start-stabbing-you-with-my-pen-due-to-game-induced-paranoia-fun).                        </div>

                            In highschool we would play from like 5 pm to like 2 am and then go out for coffee to debrief and smoke lots of cigarettes.  The only reason I think it worked was cause we didn't have shit else to do and we took breaks to go shoot hoops for an hour or throw around the football.  I can't image sitting there for that long without those breaks.                        </div>

                            I feel so un-hardcore. I think the longest I've ever gone is 8 hours, including chargen.<br/><br/>Of course, I wasn't in a steady gaming group for the first 10 years of my RPG life.

                            I'm a light-weight too for straight-out marathons, and most of the ones I've been involved with have been in the context of some of the Stanford Gaming Society's vast larps.<br/><br/>The first was "Spiral Trip", a sprawling 25-player all-night affair (the game ran from 7pm to dawn. In January). Players with multiple-personalities all drawn from strong cultural sources (King Arthur, assorted Myths, Underworld, etc.), running around Stanford campus, solving puzzles and reenacting each of their characters' major stories to free the spirits. It was pretty damn awesome.<br/><br/>Now that I think about it, SGS's EPIC larp every year is pretty marathonic. It's not entirely solid, but last year's ended up being 25 people, all larping for an entire week, for 10-14 hours a day. We ended up with a <i>lot</i> of burned-out melting--down people at the end of that...                        </div>

                            As an additional note, RPGs often need some prep work to flow smoothly, especially the traditional kind. That's why we never played very long; and my KULT GMing was very spontaneous and not relying on prepared shit, so that made that possible. We could play for a while when we had a module for another game, but once you complete the module, you need to read up on the next one, and that counts as prep time as well.<br/>
<br/>
Contrast that to computer gaming, for example: like Keith, we used to have a shitload of time in late high school, early college, and we'd take four or five computers and bring them to someone's house whose parents were out of town. Several days were spent with little sleep, some pizza and coke, and lots of networked qtest and Starcraft.                        </div>

Meeting up with some Scandanavian art larpers -- now they were hard-core!!!  I talked to quite a number of people who played in continuous multi-day larps, where you went to sleep in character and woke up in character.                        </div>

                            In my highschool days, it wasn't uncommon to play our 2-person nominally-D&amp;D freeform more or less continuously over a weekend, in and around and interweaving with movies, sports, outings, etc. Since the System as it was was mostly "hey, would this be cool? Okay. Here's what's happening. What do you do?", this worked as conversational play. I think the record for one of those RP-mixed-with-everything-else was 4.5 days at the cabin.                        </div>

                            I played freeform with a friend on a camping trip, including the drive there and back. That had to be... something like 30 hours or so. Some of the only freeform play I've done, come to think of it. It was a pretty cool Conan-type thing. We had a blast.<br/>
<br/>
For sit-around-the-table-and-roll-dice play? Proabably around 8 hours or so, tops.                        </div>

                            Oh, well, if we count freeform play, I've played about 20 hours in a row. The game culminated in a 25-player battle, and my Bubasti died fighting over the corpse of his best friend. That was through a chat inferface, though, so I had time to eat and listen to music and shit while we were playing. I can't even count the number of times I watched the sun come up while playing online... (those days of endless amounts of time and few obligations are long gone).                        </div>

                            All weekend gaming days (start friday, sleep over saturday, break sunday). I was young then. I can't see doing that now--maybe when I'm retired ...<br>

<br/>
Well, it summer vacation had just started, and Jasper and I went over to Eli's house to hang out.  We had been playing a trans-Dimensional TMNT game on and off, and Eli really wanted to play it again, but we couldn't find Jasper's character sheet.  We made a new character for Jasper (a cyborg cat) and Eli found his old guy (an armadillo) and away we went.<br/>
<br/>
The basic pretense of the game was surprisingly like Dogs, and it was inspired by The Homeward Bounders and Quantum Leap.  They were dimensional travellers who went from world to world, either solving the problems of the world or not, and moved on.  There were three other forces at work in the world (as I recall: Humanity, Mechanization, Authoritarianism, and Selfishness), and from time to time they ran into agents of those.<br/>
<br/>
All I needed to figure out for each world was the color and maybe something wrong, and the guys would take it from there.  It was pretty easy.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, it was the start of summer vacation.  We were three fourteen year olds with nothing to do, and Eli's mom would feed us for as long as we wanted to stay there.  We fell into a pretty steady cycle of sleep, play, eat, play, sleep, with me calling for breaks every once in a while to think up new ideas for worlds.  Sometimes, other friends came by, and we had them bring in guest characters (natives of the world) for a while, and then they'd leave, and we'd move on to a new world.<br/>
<br/>
It was pretty fun.<br/>

                            Amazing, Ben! Some friends told me about weekends like that, but never more than two or three days.<br/>
<br/>
In my case I'm in the under-hardcore level. Around 11 hours once. But it was a completely unexpected event. When I was at the university I got a group of players in my college for a RuneQuest campaing. Some days (around two times a week), we were playing three hours after dinner (from 10p.m to 1a.m). I remember we were near the exams period, but one night we begun a session which become so grabbing that nobody said anything about stopping. It was a group unspoken decission to continue on and on. A player of a character who die around 3a.m. stayed there to know what was going to happen at the end. We finished the story-arc around 9a.m, just for breakfast.                        </div>

                            First post here.  Fun thread.  Mine was in high school during summer vacation.  We started a game of Star Frontiers Kitty Hawk - not an RPG.  We set up the game to use all the damage and optional rules, and had four players.  We gave up after the third day, because it was apparent that with all the rules in play, we would be playing for weeks.  During those three days, we played from seven or eight in the morning to eleven or twelve at night.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of fun,<br/>

                            Hi all, <br/>
<br/>
My longest game was an AD&amp;D game back when I was 17 or so, that lasted for 20 hours. We started at 12:30 on Saturday, and finished at 08:00 on Sunday. We didn't stop to eat; we ate as we played.                        </div>

                            My longest single session without breaks other than for ordering food was a Cold Iron game in college that was about 20 hours or so. 10+ of it was a single encounter, and the reason it ran so long. We sort of didn't realize how late it was and how big the encounter would be. By 1:00 AM (our usual latest ending time), it was too late to stop...<br/>
<br/>
So the motivation was simply to finish an encounter. The structure that supported that play was a combination of low prep (especially back in college, I often did little or no prep for a session other than possibly pick a module from Dungeon Magazine to use as an inspiration). This particular encounter was not associated with any module (basically a random encounter - though I didn't use random encounter tables). The PCs had lots of buffing magic which can prolong encounters in Cold Iron. I suspect it also would have ran a lot faster if we weren't so dead tired.<br/>

                            I've never played in the same game for more than 8-10 hours. I don't understand why anyone would. ;)<br/>
<br/>
I have done all-weekend marathon gaming at GenCon though, but not all in the same game. That is, I started gaming at 8 AM, played 4 hours of this, 4 hours of that, etc. more or less all day with short breaks to grab lunch and dinner, and finished at midnight.                        </div>
