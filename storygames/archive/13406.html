We are all friends, but not close friends. (None of them read Story Games.)<br/>* There is an experienced player who is acting as "Games Master", collecting our orders, answering questions, and occasionally dispensing advice.<br/>* We meet once a week to play through a full year. 1901 is past, with few conflicts, but everyone aggressively expanding. In about four days, we will meet for 1902.<br/>* I am sharing Turkey with a teammate. However, she is a fairly passive player, so I feel like I'm really the one in charge.<br/>* Unfortunately, I missed the first session, which included Spring 1901 and negotiations leading to Fall 1901. I arrived in time to issue orders for the Fall of 1901, but missed the negotiations. As far as I can tell, my teammate didn't talk to anyone during negotiations, whilst the others were conferring quite a bit.<br/><br/>In terms of the board, I now occupy the Black Sea and Bulgaria, and have built an extra fleet in Smyrna. Austria has been expanding aggressively in my direction, and tried to capture both Bulgaria and Greece last turn. As I had been trying to hold Bulgaria and capture Greece, neither of us gained anything. As I see it, this went well for me: Austria could have guaranteed occupation of Greece, but did not succeed.<br/><br/>Italy does not seem to be aiming to expand in my direction (and is probably unaware of the Lepanto opening, which I only know from a quick Google search on "Diplomacy strategy).<br/><br/>However, Russia and Austria seem very friendly with each other, and Austria's player is openly hostile towards Turkey. It looks like I can't make much progress on my own.<br/><br/>So:<br/><br/>What can I do? What do you recommend? Will you act as my advisors?<br/><br/>Right now I am setting up an "anonymous" way to communicate with the players, so that I may spread rumours and so on. Any ideas on how to leverage that, and how long I should wait before I begin using that resource?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302267/#Comment_302267" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-25T12:03:09+00:00" title="November 25, 2010 12:03PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 12, 2011 8:37PM by Paul_T.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will attempt a photo of our current position:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_RsOOTFa4P7c/O0z7vyYx6I/AAAAAAAAASY/Ju6ITZJ_u4I/s400/058.JPG"/><br/><br/>Edit: Looks like it worked.

Are you sure that you can't convince him to move that army west? An aggressive Austria might look happy initially for Russia, but long term it will be a problem for him because of the ease of moving land forces through central europe.<br/><br/>My advice would be to press him hard for an alliance and early stab against Austria, with the balance of spoils to him (he'll need them for the north). With an Italy that seems not tremendously active, an RT alliance that dispenses with Austria quickly could have both of you racing strongly towards the endgame.<br/><br/>Immediate practical advice -- why don't you offer to convoy him into BUL while you order BUL-GRE with support form your fleet? You will need to take a risk there, because his army could be poised to take advantage of that and end run around you. You could make the offer, order the fleet east, and then plead that you were worried about the stab so you wanted to stand it off -- if you take that stance, then you'd better actually order BUL-GRE with support to show good faith at the same time.<br/><br/>Even better would be to ask him to order RUM-BUL and you'd support with CON, and you'd use your BLA to support his SEV-RUM. Then you can order your fleet to bounce him in the east, but order CON S RUM-BUL, and your ADR S BUL-GRE. Then you can long-term plan to get that Russian fleet out into the Med, you can get your second fleet out into Med as well, and you can arrange a peaceful zone in BLA with promises not to build fleets facing onto BLA.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302270/#Comment_302270" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-25T13:01:11+00:00" title="November 25, 2010  1:01PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's not an awful position, and beginner games are naturally volatile, so anything can happen yet. Normally a passive Turkey through first year negotiations would be a massive problem, as it'd be very easy for Austria to leverage this into an anti-Turkish alliance with Russia; as things stand, you should be able to talk with both of those players and figure out something other than a Turkish dismantling. Austria would be the main beneficiary if you went caput, so if he knows what's good for him, he'll drive Russia hard to join in attacking you. Russia could go either way, so that's where you need to negotiate.<br/><br/>My first advice, however, is to always be courteous and good-humoured towards everybody, including prospective enemies. There is no such thing as a permanent enemy in Diplomacy, so don't try to analyze the board in terms of friends and foes so as to know what sort of theatrical mask to wear towards each other player. This is a typical beginner mistake, to confuse the concept of diplomacy with play-acting and boisterous over-signalling; much better to act naturally and friendly towards everybody equally.<br/><br/>Tactically your position is good; Turkey's greatest strength is the immensely strong defensive position, and your presence in Bla combined with an amiable Italy makes you practically impregnable; my take here would be to sow discontent in between Austria and Russia by demonstrating to them how futile and annoying trying to destroy you would be; they could take Bulgaria with great work, but they would never <i>benefit</i> off the act, for the war with you would never end, and they would have to tie up more forces in fighting you than they'd get from seizing that Bulgaria. This is admittedly a bit of an advanced argument, but if you can understand yourself why it's better to fight wars where the outcome is actually a net increase in free units, then you can try to argue that to your opposition as well; the only way to get free units out of a Turkish war is to destroy Turkey entirely, which is really friggin' hard.<br/><br/>(If looking into the future does not work as an argument - it sometimes doesn't when beginner players go into the game with the assumption that all communications are a priori lies - then you might potentially have to go through the practical demonstration in which Russia and Austria attack you. It's important to not get disheartened here, as you'll still be willing even if those two manage to make superficial gains. It's just a matter of time before Italy backstabs Austria and Russia realizes that he's not benefiting in the war; in 1904-5 you'll be out of the war with Russia as your ally and Austria near death, yourself dominant in the Balkans.)<br/><br/>Incidentally, Austria is fucked in this situation if he decides to trust in a Russian alliance against you: the utopic Turkish dismantlement is never going to happen, or if it is, that's going to happen in five years at soonest. Meanwhile Italy will sooner or later realize that attacking Austria is an obvious route to power: you will encourage Italy in this, and perhaps choose his moment. The Italian stab in the Tyr-Tri area will show Austria how very fragile he is. Even should he somehow avoid that, the Russian betrayal you'll concoct will prove to be his doom; once you've lost/relinquished Bulgaria it'll be obvious to Russia that it will be untenable for him to hope to gain anything from the war - anything except an excellent opportunity to seize the Austrian heartland, that is.<br/><br/>In summation, I wouldn't be overly concerned with Austrian aggression at this stage; you are the wolf and he is the sheep, even if he does not realize it. (It's common for a beginner Austria to self-destruct as long as the neighbours keep a cool head.) The most interesting questions here for you are two-fold: where will Italy jump, and what will you do with that fleet in the Black Sea. The former is a heavy diplomatic and strategic question, I recommend getting into deep talks with Italy soon; beginners as well as veterans react well to concrete, realistic plans, so throw something regarding an Austrian partition on the table and try to find out what Italy plans to do. The latter is a tactical issue, and issue of Russian strategy: it would be entirely realistic for you to play time through the spring and then make a surprise attack on Rumania, for example, if you wanted to put pressure on Russia. If Italy joins you in near future it would even be favourable to shoot for Black Sea domination: take Rumania and Sevastopol and then sue for peace with the trump Russia, encouraging him to accept the fact that lasting peace between you is ensured by a Turkish fleet in Sevastopol. The other tack would be to vacate Black Sea in exchange for peace; a sensible Russia would jump for this, likely, but in a beginner game it might be better to leverage the position offensively; a beginner Russia won't realize how very fucked he is by a Turkish fleet on the Black Sea, which means that you can't leverage the position in negotiation, but only in war.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302284/#Comment_302284" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-25T14:47:39+00:00" title="November 25, 2010  2:47PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, I love reading you talk Diplomacy.

However, I'm unsure about immediate tactics. Should I "play it safe" in the Spring and try to set up a grab at, say, Rumania?<br/><br/>Or should Greece be my immediate goal? Russia can't help me there, since he chose to move his fleet into Rumania instead of an army.<br/><br/>I'm very happy to control the Black Sea, and don't trust the Russians enough to move out of there. I think it's a position of strength, and I'd like to maintain it.<br/><br/>What worries me chiefly is the apparent alliance between Austria and Russia. Both are several moves away from doing any damage to each other, but in the current situation they could orchestrate some serious damage against my forces. What orders for the coming Spring might be best defensively? I'm wondering particularly what I can do to counter a combined Austro-Russian attack on Bulgaria.

"Russia really is planning to do you in and here I drop some hints that might mean that I'm either England or France, but obviously I don't want to tell because if Russia finds out I told then I'm fucked." It's an interesting idea, but I haven't had much experience with anonymous communication, especially not the sort where you can limit the recipients.<br/><br/>Regarding immediate tactics, keeping that fleet on the Black Sea is fine for you, but an experienced Russia would consider it an extremely obnoxious and aggressive move. I was Russia in the last SG postal game and Turkey wouldn't budge from the Black Sea - it just started to annoy me so much I had to kill him to get that fleet out. He should have known better.<br/><br/>Between Greece and Rumania it ultimately depends on playing the players - will you handle Russia or Austria better as an enemy? How about an ally? If you can work well together with Russia, then go for Greece, and if you can do both, then take Rumania. It's notable that taking Greece will thrust you into closer contact with Italy, while taking Rumania puts you into a position where you also have to take Sevastopol in the long run, or relinquish Rumania after a year in exchange for some other concessions; keeping Rumania without either taking Serbia or taking Sevastopol is not really an option, as the place is in between Austria and Russia, easy for them to retake if you stay in position. If you take Rumania, do it in the fall so as to get the build out of it before the opposition adapts.<br/><br/>That Italian fleet deployment is heavily anti-French - stupid too, but that's a beginner game for you. You'd much prefer to get Italy into a fracas with Austria, of course, so perhaps you'd do well to talk with him to find out what he's planning - if it's an attack on France, you could always broker a peace between them before it gets serious. That German stab probably doesn't mean anything much, Italy is always doing that sort of unexpected stuff - it's Italy's bread and butter. In fact, one of the best ways of attacking Austria is to first go into Germany (with German concent or not) to throw Austria off the scent. If Italy actually has an army in Tyrolia, then you're cooking - just make sure Italy bounces in Munich with the army in the spring (perhaps tell Austria that France promised a support) so as to be in position to sneak into an Austria SC in the fall.<br/><br/>An Italian fleet in the Ionian is a two-pronged thing for you; as long as Italy does something ineffective in the west at least he's completely out of your hair - could even open you the option of going to the Ionian yourself. The Ionian Sea is an immensely important position, sometimes Turkey spends the entire game just trying to get there; if you can take the position because Italy messes up, it might be worth it to encourage a western strategy for Italy. Depends on whether you believe in your chances in striking a wedge between Austria and Russia; basically you need to get either Italy or Russia to attack Austria, otherwise you're in for that long and annoying defensive war I mentioned earlier. You don't need them both, although I suppose your dream scenario would be a Russian attack on Austria and an Italian land assault/stab with the Italian fleet regardless going west; then you could ally with the desperate Austria, go to the Ionian, take Sevastopol, stab Austria and move to the end-game.<br/><br/>Looking at that map and assuming hostile Russia and Austria, your best bet would probably be to go to Aeg, support Bul in place and move Bla-Sev to discourage an eastern attack. However, I don't think that you have a sufficiently substantiated Austria/Russia alliance in your hands here - the correct move would be to emphasize diplomacy, get to heavy petting with both and try to score a homerun with one if not both. Consider your diplomatic goal to be to build a viable long-term plan with both players in such a way that it does not require you to act against either immediately in the spring; this way you can gauge their intentions and get some diplomatic capital if one or both decide to betray you despite their promises.<br/><br/>This being a beginner game, I would only assume a solid anti-Turkish alliance if both players refuse to negotiate or seem to lack initiative and interest in negotiations. Beginners usually signal their intent to betray pretty well; look for over-eagerness in accepting your thoughts, perhaps.<br/><br/>The main thing in negotiation is to always have a game-plan that is both credible and involves your negotiation partner as an ally. The first thing you do before going into the negotiations with Austria and Russia is to build two plans: one where you attack Russia with Austria and one where you attack Austria with Russia. Bonus points if your own moves in both plans are the same, as then those two won't know which you're allying with from your moves. Your goal in the negotiations is to get both, or at least one, of those two to decide that your plan is better than whatever the third player is offering (if anything - beginners can be pretty pathetic about proactive negotiation now and then). The most likely result of the negotiations is that both say that they agree to your plan, at which point you'll just decide which is more trustworthy and gamble on them doing as they say - this is why you don't want a crazily risky plan. Be ready to attack with utter aggression against one of those two if it seems that only one of them is willing to work with you at this point, but also keep your eyes open for credible arrangements where you can delay making the choice of allies until the fall. And of course always keep in mind that your alliance only lasts as long as you need it, not as long as the opponent wants it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302299/#Comment_302299" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-25T20:06:40+00:00" title="November 25, 2010  8:06PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's true, Eero's Diplomacy lectures are always fascinating to read.<br/><br/>This thread makes me want to start another SG Diplomacy game.<br/><br/>Paul, your game sounds unusual.

It's hard to explain, but the particular situation in which I'm involved actually makes it quite plausible that a third party--someone entirely outside the game--could be interested in getting involved. For starters, I'm hoping they will suspect the "Games Master" as the mysterious letter sender. I've written the first letter and sent it out (just now) in his style, and directed him to deny he knows anything about it--we will see if anyone goes for it. And, of course, I will be able to hear their theories about the mysterious letters.<br/><br/>Given that situation, what kind of mischief can I throw together?<br/><br/>As for my immediate situation, I'm thinking of the following:<br/><br/>Bul moves into Greece<br/>Con moves into Bul, supported by my fleet in the Black Sea<br/>My fleet in Smyrna moves into the Aegean (possibly to support action in Greece for the Fall)<br/><br/>Actual diplomacy with Austria and Russia may change this decision, but, for now, does that seem like a sensible set of defensive orders? There are still a few nuances of the Diplomacy rules I'm not sure I understand, so I hope I haven't goofed anywhere.<br/><br/>I mostly want to avoid the possibility of losing my army in Bulgaria in the case of a coordinated attack. This way, it seems to me, I would gain Greece in exchange for losing Bulgaria, no matter what. Is that right?<br/><br/>More hostile action will have to wait until the Fall, which seems wise.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302313/#Comment_302313" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-26T01:20:36+00:00" title="November 26, 2010  1:20AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can't lose Bulgaria with Con-Bul, Bla S Con-Bul.

The worst thing that happens is Bul-Gre and Con-Bul bounce, but you're expecting that anyway. Conceivably Russia orders Sev-Arm, but you can defend against that, and possibly persuade Austria into taking advantage of the opportunity to take advantage of a distracted Russia--conceivably Austria's most dangerous rival. You might promise to help Italy into Greece in the fall if he orders TyS-Ion in the spring by supporting Tun-Gre from Bul and Aeg; an Italian army in Greece threatens Austria, not you (at least, not you immediately).

(The cardinal error that now and then occurs for everybody is that you tell your own moveset to an ally only to have the ally use it against you. For this reason risky moves that leave you open should only be made when an ally who might benefit does not know about the move.)<br/><br/>An Italian army in Greece is also a good idea. I've played this particular game with Italy several times (shipping into Greece in the first year usually, though), and historically I've often found it a good idea to stab Austria even when both Turkey and Austria are amiable - if you offer Greece to Italy and Austria doesn't immediately counter-bid, then it's a clear case in your advantage diplomatically.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302367/#Comment_302367" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-26T14:48:09+00:00" title="November 26, 2010  2:48PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More great advice--fantastic!<br/><br/>I feel like I'm beginning to get a feel for at least the basic tactics involved.<br/><br/>In the meantime, I've sent out my "mysterious" e-mails, setting up an anonymous advisor in the guise of the ghost of Archduke Ferdinand.

The question for France at this point is where is <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">his</span> her next build going to come from. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">He</span> She might try Sp 02 Mar-GoL, Spa-Mar, Por-Spa(sc); Fa 02 Spa(sc)-Wes, GoL S Spa(sc)-Wes, Mar-Pie and then either Sp 03 Pie-NAf, GoL C Pie-NAf, Wes C Pie-NAf (to set up an attack on Tunis) or Sp 03 GoL-Tys, Wes S GoL-Tys, Pie-Tus (threatening both Rome and Tunis).<br/><br/>In the north, the French may be content to simply order Bur S Bel, Par S Bur, thus guaranteeing a Sitzkrieg on the Western Front until Germany can get his act together. More likely is some pretty active Anglo-French collusion, though. Maybe something like F:Bur-Ruh, E:Lon-Hol, E:Bel S Lon-Hol, E:Nth C Lon-Hol, although the Allies have to expect Kie S Hol and thus might send Nth-Hel, Edi-Nth so that English raiders can isolate Holland from easterly reinforcements during the amphibious assault in the fall.<br/><br/>Germany should order Hol-Hel, Kie-Hol, Mun S Ruh, Ruh S Kie-Hol. He should jump up and down on the table about French intentions to Italy, court Russia assiduously, and work to turn France against England, perhaps by offering to support him into Belgium in the fall if he pulls his punches in the spring (i.e., lets him in on the Anglo-French plan).<br/><br/>Russia doesn't seem to have built optimally for offense. Maybe the Russian player didn't know he could have put that fleet on the north coast of StP, and a fleet in Sev could have let him contest Turkish mastery of the Black Sea and win. He should watch the fleet in Edinburgh carefully; Edi-Nrg is a sign of English ambitions. Anyway, F StP should boogie to Bot where it can support F Swe and keep an eye on its home port. War-Sil gives Russia some influence in what happens in Germany; Mos can go to StP, War or even Sev depending on who Russia wants to intimidate the most. Sev can either support F Rum, march across the Ukraine, or wander into Armenia; that's in order of riskiness or at least brazenness. <br/><br/>Austria is positioned to grab Greece and reclaim Tyrolia; were I the Austrian, I would do that rather than go charging into Bulgaria no matter what the Russian promised me.<br/><br/>The Italians have to regard that French fleet in Marseilles as a big, big threat--but Austria is bigger and closer. They should placate the French, mollify the Germans, and invite Turkey and Russia in on some anti-Austrian maneuvers. Tactical retrenchment is the order of the day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302384/#Comment_302384" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-26T20:45:12+00:00" title="November 26, 2010  8:45PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 26, 2010 8:46PM by Paul_T.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill... good stuff!<br/><br/>Is it your honest assessment of the situation?<br/><br/>If so, how can we subtly modify some of that advice in order to benefit Turkey in the long term?<br/><br/><br/>Also, there may be something to this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>France and England seem to have worked something out; they are both clearly pointed away from each other.</blockquote>\nOf the nine people playing, France and England are the only two women.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302402/#Comment_302402" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-27T07:39:34+00:00" title="November 27, 2010  7:39AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Usually the most effective method of giving your communications an advantageous spin is to work very hard to create a solid, truthful strategic framework that just happens to involve allying with you instead of the other guy. This is at least my own diplomatic approach: emotioning and giving self-serving suggestions to others is not nearly as useful as long as the opposition can gauge you and is not gripped by one of the many Diplomacy-related illusions; as long as the opponent remembers that it's a game and the intent is to win, you simply can't convince them of anything with a spiel that falls short of the truth. So give them truth, or at least the part of it that benefits you.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite><br/><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>if you offer Greece to Italy and Austria doesn't immediately counter-bid, then it's a clear case in your advantage diplomatically.</blockquote>\nCan you explain this part? How does this happen, and why is it a clear advantage?<br/><br/>The way I'd approach this, I'd discuss the entire strategic framework with Italy first to make sure he understands what I'm thinking, and then I'd tell him that it seems to me that him taking Greece would be advantageous to us both because of this and that. I'd likely do this as a part of a long-term plan where I discuss the opportunities for a quick stab in the Tyrolian region as well, and hint at possible partitions of Austria and later mutually advantageous developments. In case of Turkey vs. Italy I'd pledge to limit myself to two Mediterranean fleets quickly, almost without the other party asking about it; two is enough for when i want to attack Italy, anyway. (I'd even go to one fleet if that's what it takes, but then I'd require Italy to make some tactical concessions as well.)<br/><br/>The clear diplomatic advantage here comes from the fact that if Austria does not offer Greece to Italy with a complete strategic plan as a rider, then Italy will basically have the choice of taking the plan that promises him both short- and long-term advantages, or taking the sucky Austrian plan that at best offers vague promises, and possibly not even that if Austria is a green player who thinks that he can be a neighbour to Italy without engaging him fully in diplomacy. It's not even sufficient for Austria to offer Greece if he's not also capable of talking to Italy about the future; Italy will of course take Greece, but as that's what you wanted him to do in the first place, it's OK for you if Austria should offer it. Not that he's going to, with his own units in position to lay claim.<br/><br/>In summation, offering Greece to Italy is a diplomatic advantage to you because Austria has no other immediate leverage to offer to Italy in their relationship; by offering to help Italy into Greece you take away the only thing Austria could have offered, and thus remove the only concrete motivation Italy had for allying with Austria and not attacking him. If Austria realizes this and aggressively counter-bids by offering Greece and laying out a Lepanto plan of some sort, then the situation is closer to even - he can theoretically match you term by term in both gifting Greece away and laying out a long-term alliance plan, in which case the matter is much less clear-cut. However, as I said in the original quote, this is pretty much the only option for Austria diplomatically: failing to immediately counter-bid makes the choice an easy one for Italy, with the only reason for refusal being that he suspects you to renege on the promised support. (You can formulate your explanation of the plan to Italy in a way that makes it clear that it's your advantage to get Italy into Greece, too; this helps alleviate doubt, as the most suspicious offers of alliance gifts are the ones that are merely offered in hopes of alliance without the act itself being a substantial gain for the courting party. An experienced player would usually go for a promise of this sort, as you wouldn't actually benefit in any way of offering a false support for Italy; you'd have no reason to lie to him this early in the game, which would make any such promise seriously made rather credible.)<br/><br/>And of course, we have to remember that Austria might not even realize that he has to counter-bid - if he thinks that he can get by in his Italian relationship with homilies and general non-aggression, then he won't necessarily even realize that you're courting Italy before the deed is done. A smart Italy might tell him and ask for a counter-bid, but that has its hazards, too - and as discussed, Austria doesn't really have anything he can offer that you can't give to Italy, too. Diplomacy is interesting in that the same move (Italian convoy to Greece) will have completely different connotations if it's offered by Austria or Turkey than if it's initiated by Italy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302404/#Comment_302404" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-27T07:54:34+00:00" title="November 27, 2010  7:54AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, about that map: seems to me that Italy and France are going into a war against each other.

If anything, I might throw out wicked but flawed moves to sow decent in what seem like stable alliances.  For instance, has England considered entering Picardy?  If nothing else, it leaves France with a difficult defense of both Paris and Brest - dislodged, the army might find its way to Burgundy, leaving the dilemma of Paris/Marseilles.  Of course, if Germany anticipates the move it ends in disaster - likewise France.<br/><br/>I'm also curious about why your units remain in Smyrna and Constantinople.  I've only played Turkey once, and it was a while ago, but it seems like that position exerts little influence on the rest of the map, while defending from a Russian attack that will be two seasons in coming, if then.  In the meantime, if it's Austria's intention to take Greece, it's theirs.

After the fleet's dead (and Russia potentially Sevastopol-less) it's much easier to cooperate with Russia. As Russia is unlikely to accept the destruction of the fleet unless both players are rather high caliber, it's usually something you just have to live with as a matter of mutual ineffectiveness in the Black Sea; both of you keep a fleet in reserve against each other because disarmament would be so difficult.<br/><br/>I would consider a Russian army in Rumania to be considerably less of a threat to you than a fleet, as the army has lucrative options regarding Austria as well. You might encourage Russia to do Sev-Rum, War-Gal and Mos-Ukr in the spring if he seems amenable; that would give him a fine position for a traditional Russian assault in Austria, and it would pretty much weld the Russian empire to your side as a comrade in war - not much chance of Austria trusting him to turn away if he manages to get an army into Galicia, where empires are made.<br/><br/>So overall a fine proposition, except for the part where it's conceivable that Russia could be just messing with you to make you rely on his non-existent alliance. Thinking about it, acceding to a switch of units between Sev and Rum here would be the exact sort of promise I would make as Russia if I were planning to attack Turkey: I'd tell about it to Austria and then plot with him to have him offer Turkey something with a fatal weakness, so as to lure Turkey into making an ineffective offensive move, while I myself move Sev-Arm, Mos-Sev and Rum S Ser-Bul.<br/><br/>This being a beginner game I wouldn't expect the worse case scenario, though - probably a good idea to go for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302742/#Comment_302742" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-30T21:22:15+00:00" title="November 30, 2010  9:22PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, 1902 is played out... and his been very interesting.

I need you advice now, very badly!<br/><br/>Here's how the Spring unfolded:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://ihousenews.pbworks.com/f/Spring1902.png"/><br/><br/>A lot of stupid moves across the board, as far as I can tell. The tactical grasp of most players seems limited, with the possible exception of England and Austria-Hungary, who are thinking things through. Russia is doing OK, too, but is receiving a lot of advice (from the games master as well as from myself).<br/><br/>Quick summary:<br/><br/>Austria-Hungary moves an army from Trieste into Albania. Later, he said it was because he misunderstood the rules, when I pointed out to him that he could hold me (Turkey) at bay with just the two units he has there. He was probably telling the truth when it comes to this point.<br/><br/>Russia focuses his entire attention on expanding into Scandinavia. <br/><br/>Italy does something really weird and moves two armies into Africa. What the hell? I'm not sure what he was thinking. But he somehow convinced France to keep their fleets from moving into the Western Med, saying "he just wanted to pass through to the Atlantic". We all laughed at France for holding off and letting Italy through, even though Italy had no intention of moving there in the first place (as you'll see from the next move).<br/><br/>France and England show a clear alliance, and are relatively friendly with Germany. The German player seems quite gullible and has already been betrayed twice this game (again, see next slide, where he attempts to move into France only to be stabbed by Russia on the other front). Consider: Russia told him that his army approaching Berlin is a friendly unit, and that he need not worry about its presence. He believed Russia!<br/><br/>England is going aggressively against Russia and is still friendly with Germany (indeed, Germany supported England's army in Holland this turn!).<br/><br/>I attacked Greece, although it was obvious I would not get it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302809/#Comment_302809" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-01T09:43:24+00:00" title="December  1, 2010  9:43AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now we move into the Fall.<br/><br/>Russia and England are fighting furiously. However, Germany lets Russia into Berlin without opposition, allowing Russia to build in St. Petersburg at the end of the turn.<br/><br/>Italy attempts to rescue herself by retreating rapidly to the boot. <br/><br/>Germany moves into Burgundy, but chooses to disband that unit at the end of the turn (when Russia captures his supply center in Berlin).<br/><br/>On my front, negotiations with Turkey and Russia go roughly as follows:<br/><br/>I tell them that the only way I can make any progress is if one of them helps me against the other. Whoever helps me make a move first, I say, will have an advantage over the other. They both act friendly towards me and say they will think about it.<br/><br/>However, Austria and Russia are clearly allied, and instead they orchestrate a joint attack on me (in Bulgaria). Fortunately, I play a solid defensive game and hold them off, while making a supported attack on Greece from the Aegean (which is blocked, of course, by Albanian support.<br/><br/>I observed the interpersonal situation between France, England, and Germany to see that they are a pretty solid alliance, particularly France and England. You can see it on the map, but I think they earnestly think that since they are friends in real life they should not attack each other in the game. Germany could be swayed, but is obviously not willing to strike at either of them in full force. (Germany seems like a bit of a dunce so far, anyway, and quite possibly is one.)<br/><br/>So, here are my questions:<br/><br/>1. What can I do? As far as I can tell, I have few options: so long as I cannot trust either Russia or Austria, all I can do is continue to play solid defense. Is there any way I can make a move anywhere? The only option I see is moving my fleet into the Ionian to try to grab Napoli or Tunis next Fall. But if Austria moves into the Aegean, I could be in serious trouble.<br/><br/>2. My plan to create a separate persona and "advise" all the nations seems to be working. No one suspects me (at least no more than the other players), and many even think the advice could be coming from someone outside the game (last night, we had one "observer" come to watch the game, so this is plausible).<br/><br/>Several players took my advice, as offered by the "anonymous" concillor: Russia continued to move North, England placed an army in Sweden (whereas she had a fleet there originally) and mounted a solid attack on Russia, and France is planning to move into the Mediterranean.<br/><br/>However, Austria-Hungry did not take my advice, which was something like: "You can hold Turkey at bay with just two armies. Get a fleet into the Adriatic and Italy is yours. Meanwhile, supporting a Turkish attack on Rumania will bribe Russia and Turkey into war, leaving you an open path to Moscow."<br/><br/>That said, he played poorly (as he realized, seeing that his army in Albania is unnecessary to hold me back) and if he sees it that way too, he may listen to this "mysterious advisor" next turn.<br/><br/>How can I best leverage this "mysterious advisor" for 1903? People are listening to him, at least a little. They are inexperienced enough that my gambit: to send out advice that is solid enough that even if they do not trust the source they may be willing to follow the advice (by sheer force of not being able to think of anything better). England and Russia, in particular, are seeing solid results from following the advice, so they may be more pliable than others.<br/><br/>If you can help me put together a set of tactical advice for each country that will eventually help me make progress, that would be a fun and useful goal for this thread.<br/><br/>Please help!

France and England are clearly dominant, and were the players able to coordinate instead of bumbling, my first priority here would be to get Germany, Italy and Russia into some sort of cohesive action against those two; it's very easy for a beginner game to end in a clearly dominant allied pair simply because they have a personal working relationship (a "deep" alliance that can't be broken by mere game-related facts) while everybody else is busy enjoying the paranoia and wild stabbing. Were I Turkey, I'd probably gather all of the aforementioned together and talk to them about the general thrust of the game and about how it seems unlikely that the Franco-English alliance will be breaking on its own in the near future, and about how the only way for these players to prevent their own loss is to stop fooling around, make some compromises and set up a solid front to stop the western Powers.<br/><br/>Regarding the position of Turkey, a beginner game makes some things tricky - a beginner is perspective-less enough as a player to just choose a target and start pounding on him, uncaring of what is happening on the board in general. (It's pretty sad how such a player can look at you after the game, expecting praise for their ability to unbalance the board and throw victory to somebody else.) This is something Turkey needs to avoid here: if you need to make war with Russia and Austria, as you apparently have to, at least try to do it in a way that doesn't lock the players in question into a mindset where their only mission left in the game is to fuck you up with a switchblade, no matter what else happens on the board.<br/><br/>Newbie foibles aside, the Turkish position is not at all bad: Austria is clearly oriented against Italy while Russia has a northern orientation; both have clear and imminent wars with other people approaching. It should be easy for you to deceive one or both to pick up an important SC, and if you do it right in regards to timing and diplomacy, you might even manage to do it in a way that does not cause a retaliation: if the player is committed to fighting eagerly against somebody else in a much bigger war, and you make it clear that you just took this one SC because you <i>have</i> to expand somewhere, and now you two can cooperate because you are in a position to actually do something, then it's possible that you don't cause the opponent in question to overreact.<br/><br/>My read of the situation is that you should play the spring passively and on the defense to encourage Austria and Russia to ignore you, and then attack one or both brutally in the fall in the hopes of making some gain. Make peace overtures with both, of course, and be ready to betray whoever seems likeliest to be deceived in the fall. For example, you might consider moving Aeg-Ion in the spring only to turn back to Greece in the fall, while Austria thinks that you're helping him against Italy; obviously you need to do strong negotiations with Austria about splitting Italy here (ask for Tun, Nap and Rom, citing the diplomatic stability obtained by controlling all the SCs that border on the Tyrhenian Sea). Meanwhile continue pressuring Russia about moving that army into a more active position; explain to him about how Austria is tied down on his Italian adventure and that it's important for you two to set up an attack on him before he kills Italy and comes back east with actual strength; if you get Russia to start moving against Austria in the spring, then that'll make it easier to betray him in the fall, if you want to - same thing as with Austria vs. Italy.<br/><br/>Of course if one or both of those two want to really fight you, then that's pretty annoying; they cannot really make any significant advance against you if you defend yourself, but they might not have this perspective. If your read of the players is that you can't sway them to make peace in the spring, then you might be forced to play a fully defensive move-set, such as Bill suggests; this is no loss to you, but it will be intensely frustrating for those two, especially if you keep reminding them about how they're wasting unit time (the most important resource in Diplomacy) in a war that will not lead to any victory for them. It's difficult to say without knowing the players when these two will decide to turn away from attacking you - the important thing is to evaluate this correctly, as you want to time your counter-attack to happen once they do, whether it's this spring, this fall or even only next year; sooner or later they'll realize that peace with you as an ally is better than a slow and uncertain war that merely leaves their flank open for the other Power to attack at their convenience. It should be obvious to both Austria and Russia that their worst threat in a war against you is not you, but rather the other guy.<br/><br/>Incidentally, don't speak to Austria and Russia together as an unit; rather school them to have long discussions with you while talking less with each other. Talking to them simultaneously will encourage them to compare notes and make agreements instead of staying amiably quiet; amiable silence is better for you, as that's ideal for a betrayal between the two. Encourage them to talk to you by giving them advice regarding their western wars: Russia needs to defend StP, for instance, while Austria has an immediate shot at Venice by arranging for France to cooperate.<br/><br/>Also, while I'm at it - you need to realize that Italy dying would be a very serious blow against your own position, so if you can advice Italy or get somebody to attack France or Austria from the back, do so by all means. Don't think that Italy's demise has nothing to do with you. You could even cooperate with Italy tactically, although the opportunities are a bit limited what with Italy having put all his troops in weird positions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302832/#Comment_302832" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-01T11:29:08+00:00" title="December  1, 2010 11:29AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>Yes, exactly, that's what worries me:<br/><br/>It seems that the solid English-French alliance (or maybe other factors, I don't know) has convinced Austria and Russia to work together.<br/><br/>Russia is busy up North, and I've been giving him good advice, so I think he trusts and/or respects me.

Italy is positioned too far away for me to get their help, or vice versa. So a defensive game does not bode well for me long-term--it won't be long before Austria can get in another fleet and then dismantle me. <br/><br/>Am I right in this?

Then Austria kills off Russia and you two do whatever two Powers do once everybody else has been humbled.<br/><br/>As for a defensive Turkish war, it's not as bad as you think; either Austria or Russia will essentially have to throw the game to the western Powers if they are to conquer a defensively-minded Turkey after Italy has lost viability and Germany's been surprise-attacked. It's simply too slow to eradicate the Turk, and anything less than eradication is not an option the way the Turkish home SCs are set up. This is not to say that you wouldn't lose the game if that's the way they decide to play, but they'll lose it too - England and France have nothing with the same degree of defensive stability in their way, and by the nature of the board geography too much of the Russo-Austrian forces need to besiege you for them to put up a credible defense against the west. If the game boils down to France and England vs. Austria and Russia vs. Turkey, then the timing and positions will simply make killing off Turkey a losing proposition.<br/><br/>Of course the old triangle dictum applies: if the western triangle of England/France/Germany is resolved first and Italy killed off, then the western Powers get to project power against the eastern Powers before they've resolved their own poisonous dance, which usually means that the east in total loses simply out of logistical friction; the west won't have nearly as difficult time marshalling their overall strength into an unified front as the east will, and thus the eastern Powers will likely end up dead (Austria, potentially Russia) or minority partners in a draw (Turkey).<br/><br/>Looking at the Turkish defense this way, it's not that Austria and Russia can't kill you if they start trying now, but rather that doing that will be counter-productive every step of the way when England is committing everything to seizing the Nordic sphere of SCs and France is ready to seize the Italian peninsula. The timing is wrong and their units are in the wrong places and they have prior commitments that fuck them up sideways if they go into a Turkish war in any serious way: the war against Turkey needs to be engaged immediately and Italy needs to be propped up against the west if Austria is to kill off Turkey, it's not something that can be feasibly accomplished as a secondary objective on the side while killing Italy and setting up a defense against the west.<br/><br/>All of the above is, as usual, something that your opponents need to understand as much as you do - most of the time it's important for you to impose your own, truthful view of the board dynamics on everybody else as well, as without this view they'll do foolish things that lead to you losing the game.<br/><br/>Assuming that you get a manageable diplomatic situation where Austria and Russia (separately) acknowledge the necessity of a living Turkey for the time being, then there is plenty that you can do even without directly attacking or provoking them to attack each other. My favourite would probably be to sail out and have France support myself into Tunis in the fall; France can't get there on his own, and you should be able to confuse Italy about it so he won't expect the attack to come from you. Once you get Tunis, you build a second fleet, and <i>then</i> you'll have the tactical upper hand against Austria - or a solid core of a force for fighting France, as the case may be at that point.<br/><br/>(Actually helping Italy die would normally suck as a move for the east when France is doing the killing, but in this case it's justifiable for you if you don't feel that Italy has a fighting chance; you'll be the one taking the first benefit, and while France spends time consolidating the gains, you can lure him to a war against Germany or something to distract him from the fact that Turkey is actually naturally a naval power. In this strategy your goal is not to kill Austria, but merely to direct him to other directions, take Greece by force or negotiation, build lots of fleets and become the only eastern naval Power on the Mediterranean. At that point Austria will naturally need you, and any war between you should be a non-issue.)<br/><br/>Everything I write here might be read with the impression that I somehow favour the situation where Turkey is at outs with both Russia and Austria; this is of course not the case, I'm just viewing this situation as a fait accompli and discussing the modes of thought and venues of influence that are still open even when Turkey has been internationally isolated. The important thing is to keep on doing more things than your opponent does, and keep on putting pressure on the moratorium others have on cooperating with you, and keep alive with an effective defensive game and as much offense as you can get.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302843/#Comment_302843" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-01T12:09:46+00:00" title="December  1, 2010 12:09PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I\u2019ll throw in some outsider observations, keeping in mind the goal of the thread to skew decisions in support of Turkey.  <br/>Russia should expect a German counterattack on Berlin, but Germany needs to consider that Russia and Austria, so obviously allied against Turkey, may be equally allied against Germany.  Austria can prevent a successful counterattack on Berlin by attacking Munich to cut support (or seize the city if Germany wants to trade Berlin for Munich).  The Tyrolia army, as you might expect from its central location, has a key role to play in one of two conflicts:  Venice or Munich/Berlin.  It can\u2019t participate in both.  It will either coordinate operations with Russian forces against Germany or somehow get involved in the fight between France and Italy.   Austria\u2019s decision on exactly how to get involved in the Franco-Italian war is most interesting.  Austria could choose to support one side or the other\u2014and which side Austria supports will determine the victor of a Franco-Italian war\u2014or at least the early favorite.  Without Austria\u2019s help to Italy, France has to be the favorite due to its naval supremacy over Italy and the lack of pressure on France from the north.   Meanwhile, Italy\u2019s North African Army is going to have a long wait for relief.  However, Austria could decide to get involved in the war on no one\u2019s side but its own!  Ominously for Italy and France, Austria could quite easily end up in Venice while the French and Italians fight over Piedmont.  It is quite possible that France and Austria have already made an agreement of this kind, with Venice an Austrian prize while the remaining Italian centers go to France\u2014assuming Austria doesn\u2019t get there first!  It may be in the interests of France and Italy to put aside their differences and recognize that Austria and Russia are cooperating against Turkey, while Russia fights both England and Germany\u2014France\u2019s apparent friends.  In the spirit of \u2018the enemy of my friend is my enemy\u2019 France and Italy\u2019s altercation serves the interests of Russia and Austria more than either of them. <br/>Together, Germany and England can put pressure on Russia that will buy time for German or English fleets to get into the Baltic Seas, most likely through Sweden by pushing Russia back east.  Russia is a resilient country, with lots of offensive options.  However, exercising all of Russia\u2019s offensive options at the same time can be counterproductive.  For Russia to fight Turkey, England, and Germany at the same time is either brave or foolhardy or both!  As long as Germany and England can maintain a partnership, and maintain peace with France, the Anglo-German forces that to this point are unengaged, have time to shift east to combat Russia\u2019s forces\u2014and Russia has no reserves!  <br/>Finally, for Turkey, Bill White has provided a perfectly good defense.  I\u2019d like to recommend an offense but the options are limited.  Bla to Sev, if successful, can be a Pyrrhic victory as it takes the Turkish fleet out of position to support other Turkish forces, can\u2019t be supported itself, and can\u2019t exploit the success by further conquests.  In fact, success means the Russian army very likely moved to Armenia and is now operating in the Turkish rear areas.  Russia may give up Sevastopol for a time in order to take Ankara or Smyrna, or allow its Austrian ally to take Bulgaria.  Turkey would not be able to defend all three.  The good news is that Russia might not be willing to trade her loss of Sevastopol for an Austrian gain and might attack back into Sevastopol.     So an alternative to Bla \u2013Sev is Bla\u2014Arm, which will either stand off the Russian army or vacate the Black Sea.  That could lead to a series of standoffs as both sides try to get back into the Black Sea.  At least then Rumania is not being used to support attacks on Bulgaria\u2014but you can never be certain of that. And once you vacate the Black Sea, it is hard to get back in.  Alternatively, the Turkish Aegean Sea fleet could be employed offensively\u2014but against whom and to what effect is questionable.  A dash towards Tunisia will fail\u2014if the Italian army in Africa does one thing it needs to defend Tunis.  Grabbing Naples might be successful, but for Turkey, already at war with two countries, to initiate war with a third country is an act of desperation.  <br/>Thanks for the opportunity to watch and to comment.   <br/>Mel<br/>PS I have missed a few postings while writing this so I may have repeated or contradicted other comments!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302856/#Comment_302856" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-01T13:29:25+00:00" title="December  1, 2010  1:29PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul,<br/>One very risky option for Turkey that I don't think I would do but would be a game-changer (succeed or fail) is Bul to Rum, Bla S Bul to Rum, Con to Bul, Aeg S Con to Bul.  <br/>This will either lead to the loss of Bulgaria and destruction of the Bulgaria army or the gain of Rumania and destruction of the Russian fleet.  The key is what does Sevastopol do?  Russia is playing aggressively--with the charge into Berlin as the main indicator of that.  So the move Sev to Arm is not out of the question.  <br/>The question for you is what type of player are you--or, really, what type of player do you want to be in this game or in this turn?  If you want to minimize your maximum loss, which is always a good rule of thumb, then select defensive orders.  If you want to maximize your minimum gain, which will lead to a game fraught with moments of sheer anxiety, then attack Rumania.  Bla to Sev is, I think, splitting the difference.  <br/>Turkey can defend against Russia and Austria for years.  It will be a frustrating game for them and for you.  However, as long as you are still in play, there exists the chance that the situation will change.  An unsuccessful attack, with the loss of Bulgaria, makes defending a lot harder for Turkey.  But success would be cool!<br/>I am assuming any attack on Bulgaria would come from Austria, with Rumania in support.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302862/#Comment_302862" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-01T14:00:30+00:00" title="December  1, 2010  2:00PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent advice, everyone, thank you--although the situation still looks pretty grim to me.<br/><br/>I am going to try to check whether the attack on Bulgaria was designed to benefit Austria or Russia, and let you know.<br/><br/>In the meantime, is no one interested in crafting advisory letters to the various nations, in order to manipulate them into new and interesting positions?<br/><br/>Like I said, most players don't trust the "mysterious advisor" just yet, but some are beginning to, and often enough they might go with a solid suggestion rather than trying to come up with something on their own: the players in this game are not just inexperienced but also really short on free time, which means they have little time to consider moves and put together a good set of orders.

Ideally, they can manage a double envelopment, presenting Turkey with a defensive dilemma.  The Bulgarian defense cannot be pierced without bringing more forces to bear.  Similarly, war with both Germany and England means Russia has no excess forces to do much more than hold current possessions\u2014and only with Austrian help.

Italy can certainly be convinced your move to the Ionian is an anti-Austria move.  And you're spot on that the risk of moving to Ionian is that you don't get a supply center and Austria in the meantime moved to Aegean.  That will make the long-term defense of Bulgaria impossible, as you will be guessing whether to attack Greece or Aegean in order to cut support.  It would be especially hard if Austria had a unit in Albania that could backfill Greece (if it didn't then the attacking unit would almost certainly be Aeg).  <br/><br/>But even without getting a supply center, there are some positives to moving to the Ionian.  The first is you never know what might happen--something could open up,  But more reasonably, your bargaining position with Austria, France, and even Italy becomes stronger.  You may be able to trade your support against Italy for French support against Austria.  Or vice versa.  The political point that Austria and Russia have to be realizing is that France, Germany and England are not fighting each other.  That means they are positioned to cooperate against the east.  Russia, Turkey, and Austria will be defeated in detail as the west remains united.  A deal with Austria whereby Turkey builds only fleets (or some ratio) demonstrates the value Turkey could bring while being relatively non-threatening.  France already has quantitative naval superiority in the Med; Austria is going to want some allied fleets.  <br/>One final point in favor of a move to the Ionian.  The defense of Turkey doesn't start until Bulgaria is lost.  Turkey can still defend itself for a while even with just three units, as long as it has control of the Black Sea, especially if the fight can be limited to one side of the Black Sea or the other.  I don't have any proof of this other than my own dismay at having too often to try to crack open Turkey.  <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302880/#Comment_302880" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-01T16:10:47+00:00" title="December  1, 2010  4:10PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mel,\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mel White</cite>One final point in favor of a move to the Ionian.

I think that your position is not any more desperate than anybody's position comes to in Diplomacy - most players who've had a couple of games under their belt have been doing much, much worse and still scraped up from the brink to win (that is, draw). The thing to remember is that as long as you think that the natural state of the board consists of a limited number of locally minimal energy states (using a chemistry analogy here), you'll always be aware of how any pressure exerted against you is actually causing counter-pressures on the aggressor; as Turkey on the defensive you need to recognize what those pressures are and ensure that the related risks are realized: attacking you has to mean that the border that was emptied to do it <i>is</i> attacked, and the enemy Power that was passed over in favour of attacking you will grow dangerously powerful and aggressive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302889/#Comment_302889" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-01T17:05:36+00:00" title="December  1, 2010  5:05PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the counter-pressures analogy.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>as Turkey on the defensive you need to recognize what those pressures are and ensure that the related risks are realized: attacking you has to mean that the border that was emptied to do it<i>is</i>attacked, and the enemy Power that was passed over in favour of attacking you will grow dangerously powerful and aggressive.</blockquote>\nHow can Turkey do this right now?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302893/#Comment_302893" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-01T17:38:47+00:00" title="December  1, 2010  5:38PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll tell you a secret that some have been wondering about in these Story Games Diplomacy games - how come when I decide to attack Eero somebody else always decides to attack my flank the very next turn? It's not actually that difficult, you just need to ask the other guy neighboring your enemy to help you out by attacking them. They will usually do this because, first, the fact that your enemy attacked you means that they'll have a soft flank, and second, it's usually easier and probably better to do what somebody asks you to do rather than doing an arbitrary other thing, especially if the guy doing the asking has a head on his shoulders and can provide you with good advice.<br/><br/>In practical terms, assuming that Austria and Russia have a solid alliance and have already planned for your demise: you recognize where the allies are sacrificing position, potential, security, dynamic ability and other values so as to be able to attack you, and then you make sure that those risks are realized by informing anybody who'd benefit from exploiting them in as clear terms as you can. I find that being theatrical about this communication is not useful, you're not there to roleplay - just try to explain to others in as clear terms as you possibly can why and how they can benefit from the Austro-Russian decision to attack you. Once you've done this communication you'll then maximise the difficulty of attacking you and wait for the Austro-Russian alliance to shatter; the smarter one of the duo notices that they underestimated the difficulty of killing you and starts answering your biannual suggestions of stabbing the other positively. (You are, of course, talking with both of them every turn to update your plan of how the two of you can do unto the third one most effectively.)<br/><br/>In Diplomacy, when somebody attacks somebody else, this is always against the interests of any third parties, as a success in such an attack means that the attacker grows in strength and thus comes closer to victory. For this reason a player who can communicate the logic and translate it into concrete suggestions will always have the edge in negotiations; Austria that attacks Turkey is naturally at disadvantage against Turkey on the question of whether Germany should backstab Austria in response, for example; in practice Austria can get one over Turkey anyway on this issue if he has prior long-term agreements with Germany, or Germany is in another war, or if Austria is so strong from other possessions that he can fight on two fronts effectively. Most of the time, however, the basic nature of the game will ensure that other players have a vested interest for coming to the aid of the weaker party in a war.<br/><br/>(The above doesn't count for players who show a weak diplomatic hand, incidentally: if a player seems untrustworthy or airheaded, others will often deny him aid simply because they don't believe that they can benefit from it themselves. There's also the issue that if a weak player can't protect himself, then it might be better to take a part of his SCs for yourself and protect them that way from the aggressive party. The lesson is, don't seem weak as a player even if your absolute board strength is currently less than your opponent's; don't let others think that the best thing to do is to split your possessions between them.)<br/><br/>In practice what you do in the current board position to make Austria and Russia pay for attacking you is that you make sure that England has the motivation and the knowhow to execute a devastating attack on Russia, and you make sure that Italy does his level best to defend against Austria (perhaps broker a peace between Italy and France by having the latter attack Germany). Then you ensure that both Austria and Russia are acutely aware of the best moves they can make each turn were they to decide to attack the other; promise to support Austria into Rumania, and Russia into Serbia, for example. You'll find that if you can get those two to attack each other even once, your position will become immeasurably stronger, as then they've proven to one another that they're capable of actually playing the game instead of just agreeing to collude against you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grover" title="Grover"><img alt="Grover" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grover">Grover</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302905/#Comment_302905" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-01T20:52:02+00:00" title="December  1, 2010  8:52PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not much of a diplomacy expert, but I thought I'd describe an idea I had for a diplomatic approach.  <br/><br/>The problem is that Austria and Russia can stop Turkey cold just by maintaining pressure, even if they can't actually destroy him.

If England and France hypothetically never, ever broke their alliance and the the others failed to stop them, then the most likely long-term development would be for England, France and Turkey to be the only Powers left on the board - Turkey would likely remain as the last contender due to geography. The thing is, a three-Power situation is only really reducible in Diplomacy if the players are colluding with each other (barring some extreme exceptions), so assuming that England and France are playing honestly and both are actually trying to win the game, they should stop each other from conquering Turkey simply to ensure that the other doesn't reach 18 SCs and win the game. This self-balancing feature means that a Power that survives to be one of the last three will become part of the final draw as long as neither of the other two manages to take a solo victory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302969/#Comment_302969" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-02T10:15:10+00:00" title="December  2, 2010 10:15AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is it possible to capture Greece via retreat?<br/><br/>In a hypothetical situation where Bulgaria is lost but Greece is a standoff, like this:<br/><br/>F Aeg moves to Ion<br/>F Greece moves to Aeg<br/><br/>Then a series of attacks destroys Bulgaria but leaves Greece open (because my F Ion prevents Austria reentering Greece).<br/><br/>I know it's not a likely scenario, but if it were to happen, could Bulgaria "retreat" into Greece?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302972/#Comment_302972" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-02T10:22:14+00:00" title="December  2, 2010 10:22AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 2, 2010 10:22AM by Bill_White.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can retreat into any unoccupied adjacent province that your unit could normally enter (e.g., fleets can't retreat inland) that isn't empty because of a stand-off. <br/><br/>So if Greece were empty as a result of A:Gre-Aeg, T:Aeg-Ion <b>in the absence of a standoff like A:Alb-Gre, T:Bul-Gre</b>, then if your army in Bulgaria is dislodged, it may indeed retreat to Gre.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302973/#Comment_302973" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-02T10:32:03+00:00" title="December  2, 2010 10:32AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll admit to TL;DR (can you blame me?)... but I have to ask:<br/><br/>Do the other players have a team of experts advising them online?

That's too bad for me!<br/><br/>David, I'm really only interested in a) learning about the game, and b) having some fun in a way tangential to the game itself.<br/><br/>My position in the game (as Turkey) leaves me with very little to do. This is compounded by the fact that I *share* Turkey with another player.<br/><br/>Basically, I guess I like turn all my games into roleplaying games. Instead of being bored by my position in the game, I can create a character and play that character, just for general kicks. It's an interesting experiment, though, I think.<br/><br/>(And I'm quite certain that at least one or two other players are similarly doing research and getting help.)<br/><br/>In any case, it's a "friendly" game, not a competitive one. Like most of the other players, I'm only in it to have fun and to create another reason to socialize with people I don't get to see all that much. I'm not really concerned with winning, although I <i>am</i> curious how far good tactics will get me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302986/#Comment_302986" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-02T11:52:30+00:00" title="December  2, 2010 11:52AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            S'all good; kind of what I figured, although I missed the shared-ownership thing.

In the current game, right now, this means splitting the Austria-Russia alliance (the immediate threat to Turkey); splitting the England-France alliance (the long-term threat to Turkey); continued English pressure against Russia (to reduce the force Russia can apply against Turkey or even lead to Russo-Turkish d\xe9tente), France-Italy cooperation against Austria (to similarly make peace with Turkey a real need for Austria), focusing Germany\u2019s attention on the Russian threat (to push back Russian expansion).  <br/>Easier said than done, obviously.  Splitting Austria-Russia to the point of one betraying the other probably won\u2019t happen until the betrayal has demonstrably more benefits than adhering to the partnership.  But splitting Austria-Russia doesn\u2019t have to mean betrayal.  If one partner or the other agrees not to continue offensive actions against Turkey that is a result almost as good as an actual betrayal as it makes defending Turkey easier.  And, if the decision by the partner is made known to the other partner, he, too, might agree to an armistice.  One-on-one fights in the early game are much too fair to be worth fighting.  <br/>I think Russia is a good target for diplomatic efforts along this line.  He has taken all he is going to get in the Balkans and will need that Sev army to fight Germany.  Plus, if the player is concerned with \u2018honor\u2019, you\u2019re not looking for a betrayal of Austria, just peace with Turkey.  He may feel honor bound to keep fighting if Austria keeps fighting, so this would be one instance where talking to Russia and Austria at the same time makes sense.  In fact, you can tell them that you were wrong to suggest (before Fall 1902) that the only way you could make progress was if one of them betrayed the other.  It\u2019s clear that you can make progress as their partner, with your fleets complementing Austrian armies\u2026while Austria and Russia work together in the center and Russia handles England in the north.  You\u2019ll all meet in London.  <br/>Whether France and Italy can work together or France fights Italy, Austria is going to want to look west soon in order to gain some of the Italian territory as well as assist Russia in Germany, and to prepare for what happens once Italy is eliminated and France continues east.  <br/>English pressure on Russia in the north is one of the factors that may convince Russia to make peace with you.  Although I don\u2019t see any immediate breakthroughs, Russian forces are fully committed right now, while England (and Germany), have multiple units that are not yet engaged against Russia.  As these forces are brought into the fight, Russia will face defensive dilemmas it cannot solve, unless it can pull Sevastopol north (and maybe not even then).  Anglo-German cooperation, for the time being, helps Turkey.  <br/>Franco-Italian cooperation directed against Austria is probably too much to hope for.  Still, the points to make supporting such a partnership stem from the naval superiority a combined Franco-Italian armada would have over the single existing Austrian fleet, as well as the potential for an Austrian war against Turkey.  Failing that, Austria could be convinced that there are easier pickings against Italy than against Turkey.  This seems clear without much convincing.  Your support for his fleet into the Ionian potentially gives him shot at Naples or Tunis\u2026or at least gives Austria some influence whether France or Italy get Tunis.  Austria should want to delay France\u2019s rise as much as possible relative to Austria\u2019s own expansion.  Or you can seek Austrian support to move your fleet to Ionian, as you suggested earlier.  I think you know what you\u2019re doing!<br/>So, in conclusion, I think Turkey is not in bad shape.  It can defend itself for a while.  I think the Russia-Austria alliance is not set on defeating Turkey\u2014you may have unintentionally given them more concern than is real.   More importantly, there are other threats and opportunities that should attract Russian and Austrian attention.  They should welcome the opportunity to gain your support.<br/>Finally, as you wrote, you can\u2019t trust anything Russia or Austria tells you at this point.  Your orders for Spring should focus on defending Bulgaria.  You\u2019ll know by Fall if Russia and Austria are aiming to eliminate you.  Defend strongly in Spring, and don\u2019t offer something you won\u2019t deliver.  To me, that means don\u2019t get involved in a betrayal of Russia/Austria vs the other until you\u2019ve seen it.  That means you can support one in a move that is neutral (such as Aeg support Gre to Ion), but don\u2019t support an attack of one against the other because it might not happen.  And don\u2019t offer to support such an attack.  For the time being, you\u2019re playing nice.   <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303218/#Comment_303218" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-04T12:15:57+00:00" title="December  4, 2010 12:15PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here, by the way, is something timely from the Diplomatic Pouch 'Zine <a href="http://www.diplom.org/Zine/S2010M/Durvine/novices.htm" rel="nofollow">Playing with Novices.</a><br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303221/#Comment_303221" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-04T12:48:36+00:00" title="December  4, 2010 12:48PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you very much, Mel!<br/><br/>That is exactly the sort of thing I was hoping for: what kinds of strategy on the larger board would both make good plans for the countries involved and help Turkey in the long term.

This is apparently unrealistic at the moment, so the main means of handling Italy here would probably be to give him solid tactical advice to make sure he's as difficult a snack for France as possible. The second thing to do is to ensure that France and Austria end up at logger-heads over Italy; for instance, make sure that both of them think of Venice as an essential part of their long-term strategy so as to avoid having France just give it to Austria.<br/><br/>Ultimately the only way to stop a France that has secured her northern frontiers is by putting equal force against her, which is tricky to do for the easterners at the best of times, and almost impossible once France has assimilated the Tyrhenian properties and built 2-3 extra fleets. Austria should be made aware of the danger if he's not already: the Eastern Mediterranean area will face an almost impossible French pressure if and when the core Italian properties fall to a France that does not have northern opposition. This should make the Austrian think twice about making it <i>easy</i> for France to get through the operation.<br/><br/>Ultimately the best way to handle a Franco-Italian war is to ensure that Austria and Turkey back up Italy, and each other if and when France gets to the Ionian Sea. Those three Powers can stop France reasonably enough if only they're able to compartmentalize their own disagreements a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303226/#Comment_303226" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-04T13:00:21+00:00" title="December  4, 2010  1:00PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, great stuff.

For instance, were I France at this board? Stabbing England would definitely be big in my sights. Retreat from Italy, swing those fleets to the Atlantic and see if Russia wants a piece of the Nordic cake. Italy would not be willing and able to follow up on me, so I'd have both a surprise and a secure flank. Could even do something opportunistic in Germany with Russian help.

I approach the Russian, offering him peace if he retreats now. I tell him I will convoy him across the sea next turn, to grab Austrian territory, if he retreats this turn. However, I hedge my bets with a defense of Smyrna and an attack into Rumania, just to see if he will stick with the agreement or not. He does not make good on the deal, striking at Smyrna, and is bounced by my army, gaining nothing.<br/><br/>Austria tries to take Greece, but I hold him off again with a supported attack.<br/><br/>I convince Austria that he's better off nabbing Naples (Napoli) instead of coming my way, as I now know he was planning (I later saw the order he had scratched out to write in the attack on Naples).<br/><br/>For whatever reason, Russia and Austria are really hell-bent on capturing Turkey. But I've managed to hold them off. My reasoning against Russia is as follows: with one army, I have a 50% chance of stopping his advance, and meanwhile he can't stop me taking one of his territories.<br/><br/>However, the build/disband phase complicated things. <br/><br/>I offered Russia a second chance for peace, if he would disband one of his units on my borders. He chose to disband Finland, instead. <br/><br/>Italy reasonably disbanded North Africa.<br/><br/>Austria, meanwhile, built in Budapest.

Every turn of successful defense or counter-attack, every third-party intervention and every success others have on other parts of the board rubs your erstwhile neighbour's nose on the fact that they're not getting what they wanted out of attacking you. In this particular case Austria and Russia are relatively committed to not cooperating with you, but that doesn't change the basic technique.<br/><br/>The French play is such that my own reaction to similar is usually to play a very close diplomatic game with the player: stay close, advice often, be sympathetic about their uncertainties, fear and distrust. Usually extreme passivity is because a player feels overwhelmed by the game's tactics and exaggerates the dangers of betrayal in their mind; they're fearing losing and being the victim of a betrayal so much that they're willing to lose by inactivity instead of being made the fool. Often another player who is clearly in an impartial position on the other side of the board can advice such players successfully by arguing from their position: acknowledge the things the player is thinking, and then tell them what to do on the basis of their fears - no matter whether their thinking is realistic or not. In this case you'd probably want to just keep harping on about the necessity of turning north and leaving Italy alone, in as many variations as you can think of; it might take time to take root, but sooner or later the uncertain player will play every option offered to them.<br/><br/>Obviously enough, make sure that England has the best move-set she can have for decimating Russia; also let Russia know that you're advicing England, make him fear your tactical insight; ensure that it's absolutely clear that you'll fuck up the Czar seven ways to Sunday by proxy as long as he maintains his anti-Turkish attitude. Show a bit of anger, make him realize that lying to you for frivolous reasons like he's been doing is a way of making a dangerous enemy. Be the sort of enemy where he'd want to have a real army at hand, so as to make him realize that he <i>can't</i> actually have one because he's under Anglo-German assault up north.<br/><br/>Italy is basically non-feasible now, which means that you need to make sure the player doesn't give up: wrack your brain to give him optimistic, solid advice for playing the underdog game. Most gamers are instinctually inclined to go home and cry in Diplomacy when the going gets rough, so you need to counter-act the tendency by showing the player the attitudes and thinking that go with being the underdog. Remind them that the goal is to survive, and victory means being still alive at the end of the game so as to participate in the draw; solo victories are the stuff of fantasy fiction, exceptions to the rule. Italy might have great difficulty getting up and becoming a major Power (not that it can't happen if the player keeps their head), but that's no reason to start playing an even worse game or even NMR'ing in the middle of the game; he should respect the other players and their passion by playing the best game he can even when the situation is dark.<br/><br/>Aside from those observations, the large-scale situation is basically as I've outlined before - Turkey in your position needs to break up the Russo-Austrian alliance, and while Turkey usually could defend indefinitely against those two with some diplomatic work, an extremely weak Italy is causing you difficulty by being a very impotent ally against Austria and by attracting French attentions. Even then, it'll take time and resources for those two to eliminate you, which means that you have time to talk to them and their western neighbours, engineering more western pressure for your enemies and keeping them apprised of how the strategic situation is developing against them as they blindly attack you.<br/><br/>(Not all assaults on Turkey are blind, of course, but for the purposes of diplomacy you as Sultan will, of course, hold onto the stance that these particular attacks on Turkey are foolish and liable to cause adverse imbalances in the European situation, imbalances that lead to the destruction of the entire eastern triangle. It's possible that your enemies are acting rationally about killing off Turkey, of course - I myself would greatly prefer to start the game as Austria by killing Turkey. Of course it never happens because attacking Turkey is such a pain in the ass.)<br/><br/>If the situation seems diplomatically truly desperate, you might choose to employ the extreme gambit: if Russia and/or Austria blatantly disrespect your negotiation and signal that they're not considering a living Turkey in good faith, then the correct play for you is to very loudly let the both of them know that you're willing to throw the game to one of those two players if they do not ease up on you and help you out against the other guy. This is sort of the Diplomacy nuclear option: by tactically throwing your possessions to one of your neighbours while fighting the other with everything you have you could theoretically cause them such a powerful position that the only logical consequence for the other neighbour would be death in the hands of the dominant eastern Power. A player blessed with basic intelligence will thus realize that the only way for them to prevent you from throwing the local game to their other neighbour is by keeping you at least happy enough to not suicide yourself.<br/><br/>(Make a distinction between threatening the above course and actually committing to it; ideally you'll never actually suicide in Diplomacy, but if and when you're convinced that your neighbours truly are so stupid/colluding that there is basically no way for you to convince them to change their minds, then you might as well do it and not just talk about it; if you're losing the game anyway, then every step you take should be the one that optimizes your survival after all. A biased suicide is ironically a pretty good option in this regard, as often enough your actually starting to commit the act will also trigger that breakdown in the enemy alliance you've been waiting for; you might lose half of your SCs and be left with a barely viable trump state, but if the troop positions are correct, it's possible for that trump state to continue in existence as a balancing linchpin between the two now clearly dominant local Powers. Of course this isn't going to happen if the players have decided in advance in the meta-game that they'll kill you off, but then they're basically cheating - nothing much to be done about it if they're both willing to compromise their own success in the game just to make sure you lose.)<br/><br/>I'm not suggesting that your situation is desperate enough now to start talking about throwing it to one of your neighbours, but that's just because I'm not there in the field observing the other players. You'll have to decide for yourself if there is actually a person considering your diplomacy there in control of your enemy or if it's one of those players who shut their ears against enemy lies once they've made an alliance at the start of the game. Observing your enemy and deciding how they think will let you know how big a hammer you need to be using to make them actually listen to you; against an experienced player you should theoretically never have to speak of suicide, but as this is a beginner game, it's possible that the players arent' simply calculating the situation up to the very end and are therefore unaware of how, exactly, the killing of Turkey will ultimately go down. They might be talking completely unrealistic stuff among themselves, which is why you need to talk with them constantly and discuss the future with them, including the future where they eat up Turkey and ride into the sunset: you need to make them realize that no, Austria won't be just taking Bul and Con while Russia takes Smy and Ank - all that stuff is optimistic rubbish when you account for the fact that Turkey will be meanwhile colluding with Russia to ensure that Austria gets <i>nothing</i>, and Russia'll be building new armies to start up an anti-Austrian war the very next winter after they start actually gaining builds off Turkey. That's the sort of discussion a truly desperate Power goes into once it's obvious that his neighbours have decided to kill him. Still might not work if it's more important to the other players to kill you than to win the game, or if they're playing basically unfairly by having decided a priori that they'll never betray each other, but it's pretty much your last shot if everything else fails.<br/><br/>My estimate from the board positions is that you're not in the suicide territory yet, but if the players seem disinterested in your arguments and they routinely and blatantly lie to you only to ignore all agreements the very next turn, then perhaps you are there. Your call. Don't start that sort of thing prematurely; suicide is heady stuff in this game, and difficult to communicate in a way that doesn't make you sound like an irrational crybaby.<br/><br/>We can talk tactics, too, but it seems to me that you have a basic handle on that stuff. Just keep outguessing your opponents while you make sure to give everybody on the board a suggested, high-quality move-set that does not involve attacking you. This includes England, France, Italy, Austria... everybody deserves to have a slice of your tactical genius. It's so much easier to do what you want somebody to do if they already have at hand a smart, full moving plan they can just follow and prosper with it. (This approach to tactical discussion of course presumes that you're not in the business of trivial betrayal yourself.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303720/#Comment_303720" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-08T15:45:47+00:00" title="December  8, 2010  3:45PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Short tactical observations while I'm here:\n<ul>\n<li>Warn Russia of an Austrian attack on Rumania, point out that you have nothing to lose in supporting such. Offer to support Austria into Rumania, explain to him how a navally oriented Turkey can be an invaluable ally; promise Rum-Sev to Austria if he swings that way, explain to him why it's tactically very likely that he can roll up everything up to the borders of StP by acting quickly. Ask for Gre and the Italian SCs in trade, but make clear that you only expect to take possession of Greece next year and the Italian SCs as the situation allows; no intent to force Austria to disband anything to fulfill the obligations.</li>\n<li>Tell Russia to get the fuck out of Armenia, the Sultan is not looking at that sort of move for a second - the only reason for an army there is the intent to utterly annihilate Turkey, there's no compromise in that move. Warn of grave consequences, including your willingness to suicidally cover Ank and Smy while relinquishing Bul and Rum both to Austria just to see the Czar burn on his own bonfire. (Note that this is your best desperation play anyway - Bul is something you can lose, your home SCs are the best defensive triplet you have.) Tell him that all offers of actual cooperation are off until he's back where he belongs, and he should do that anyway because an Austrian assault is imminent (especially if it's up to you - you'll delight in the chance to help Austria along in stringing up the fuckwit Russian).</li>\n<li>Get England and Germany to play Ska-Swe, Swe-Fin with appropriate supports. The intent would be to get a second fleet to the Baltic area; England keeps Sweden for this year while Fin-StP gets Germany another SC as a certain take - Russia can't prevent it. Germany gets to move Den-Bal as a bonus in the fall. Of course England kills Germany dead next year if Germany goes for this match-up, but perhaps that's not your problem - or perhaps you'll advice Germany to stab England in the fall somehow, and it's his problem if he's stupid enough to not see the dominant English position.</li>\n<li>Get Russia to attack Lvn-Kie while Italy cuts Munich (because he thinks that Russia's going to support him there). This is a spring move, so Italy'll have time to recover in the fall if he's going to, and meanwhile Russia gets utterly committed against Germany - and of course loses necessary defense in StP, meaning that he'll be utterly mixed up in a western war if you can pull this and the above point off. Should make him consider his southern dalliance in a different light.</li>\n<li>It might be difficult to get Italy to realize it, but he's dead, and he should be playing towards a defensive turtling position: 2 SCs that can support each other and have a strong defensive geography. This'll allow him to bide his time and wait for the empires around him to stabilize, in which case a lucky Italy might survive until the end-game or even get a legendary revival via stabbing somebody at the right moment. The best Italian option in this regard strategically is to fight for Rome and Naples; they're not tactically obvious at the moment, so you might not get him to do it, but it's basically what I'd do myself: use Tyr to fuck up somebody else (or go Tyr-Ven if you're boring), move Ven-Rom and Tun-Ion, and then try to retake Naples in the fall, resulting in his own units holding both Rom and Nap. Crucial to set the stage with France and Austria, of course; ideally neither gets Venice in the spring and France doesn't want to or understand to support Nap in place in the fall.</li>\n<li>For your own moves, choose: if Russia is not backing down (and if he's already established that he lies indiscriminately, how could you trust him to?), consider simply covering your home SCs and supporting Austria with everything you have - an Austrian bias is currently easier and less dangerous for you to pull, kamikaze-gambit-wise, than the opposite. (Player psychology applies, of course - if it seems that the opposite move might cause better reactions, then I guess you could give Bul to Russia or something.) On the other hand, if you don't feel that it's suicide gambit time yet, then ignore Armenia (because the only reason to not go for a suicide gambit here is if you think that he's backing down), support Austria to Rumania and attack Greece yourself (sharing the plan with Austria to taste).</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303746/#Comment_303746" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-08T19:47:22+00:00" title="December  8, 2010  7:47PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What moves would you recommend for Italy and Turkey?<br/><br/>They each present quite a puzzle.

There's a lot of stuff there that lines up with what I was thinking (I'm planning to work as hard as I can to convince Italy to move Tun-Ion, so as to put himself in a better position AND block Austria's retreat, should that fleet head back my way). In fact, your plan for Italy is exactly what I've been planning to suggest to him. There's also some things I hadn't thought of, however!<br/><br/>Here are a few other things I have gathered about the players:<br/><br/>Russia is extremely aggressive. I should be able to talk him into attacking Kiel, but I don't expect him to back down from attacking me.<br/><br/>Austria is a cautious and careful player. I would be VERY surprised if he does not keep trying to hold Greece as hard as he can. I'm thinking of making a supported attack there in the Spring, just to frustrate him, before moving on to my actual plans for the Fall, but hoping he commits his units to that attack again (remember, Greece is his, not mine) while I can act elsewhere.<br/><br/>England and Germany are likely to maintain their alliance: England's player was sick and let Germany write her orders for her (with consultation over the phone during the game). That's why Germany didn't attack England from the North Sea in the Fall--that's what I had advised, but I think the player would have felt that to be a totally unfair move, and thus didn't go for it. However, I *will* work at pointing out the advantages they can gain by attacking each other once Russia is under control.<br/><br/>Getting Austria to cooperate against Russia will be tough for me. I'm hoping to talk him into just going to grab Warsaw instead. I don't think he will suddenly agree to any kind of alliance, so my better bet is to keep Russia off-balance and then hope to grab some of his territories (further down the road, but before Austria does).<br/><br/>I'm thinking at this point that my best hope as Turkey is to survive this year, possibly grab Sev, and wait for Russia to disband (which he will most likely have to do) at the end of the year. Then my options open up. Does that sound realistic?<br/><br/>My nightmare scenario (as best I can imagine) is a combined attack on Bulgaria and a standoff in Sev (with Austria possibly moving in to Rumania). I think I can convince the Russian that letting Austria into Rumania would be disaster for him.<br/><br/>What happens if I order BLA-Sev, and Russia moves into the Black Sea while Austria moves into Rumania? That sounds very dangerous to me. Is it enough of a reason not to order BLA-Sev? I'm trying to see if I can win Rumania AND Sev somehow this turn.

So if you want to be aggressive, you could move either Bla-Sev or Bla S Bul-Rum, which both have a chance of working, but no certainty. Meanwhile the Armenian army will have a good chance of targetting Ankara (or Smyrna), which means that you'll need to defend the place with Constantinople.<br/><br/>Therefore, were I to choose an aggressive moveset here as Turkey, it'd be one of these two:<br/>F Bla-Sev<br/>A Bul-Gre<br/>F Aeg S Bul-Gre<br/>A Con-Ank (-Smy, depending)<br/>Or:<br/>F Bla S Bul-Rum<br/>A Bul-Rum<br/>F Aeg-Bul (or Aeg-Smy, depending)<br/>A Con-Ank (-Smy, depending)<br/><br/>Thing is, attacking at this juncture is pretty risky. Your home SCs form a relatively defensible entity, but only if you don't allow enemy forces to waltze in. The above sorts of moves basically give you a chance of taking a precarious SC from Russia in exchange for the chance of losing one of your home SCs to him. This is a spring move, too, which means that one of the projected outcomes might well be that you actually succeed in both bouncing Armenia and taking Sevastopol (let's say) only to lose the place to Russia on the backswing in the fall. This means that your expected value out of the move in pure resource terms is actually negative; if Russia manages to take one of your home SCs, you'll have trouble getting him out again, but if you manage to take Sev or Rum, those two well might just drive you out in the fall. This means that you're not even gambling at even odds here.<br/><br/>From what you're saying it sounds to me like Russia would be a more likely neighbour of the two to stop harassing you. You just need to shout at him loudly enough so that he hears the facts: he's losing StP to the extremely solid Anglo-German alliance soon, and he's committing to a long war to the death with Turkey by his aggression at the same time. This makes no sense, he only courts disaster by fighting Turkey, Germany and England simultaneously. Why would he not withdraw from the only war in the set that he can? I see no other reason than utter disregard for his own game - challenge him to justify his own moves, accuse him of stupidity and insipid willingness to lose just to spite you. Whatever it takes to get him to explain to you why he's insisting on a stupid war where he doesn't have any sort of follow-up to his two piddly troops adventuring in the south.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303903/#Comment_303903" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-10T10:05:15+00:00" title="December 10, 2010 10:05AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there any sense to playing full defense this turn? <br/><br/>As I see it, if Austria moves into Greece in the Spring (and why wouldn't he?), Turkey won't be able to hold Bulgaria in the Fall.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303991/#Comment_303991" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-11T09:48:13+00:00" title="December 11, 2010  9:48AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul,<br/>I think playing defense is a pretty good idea, especially in the Spring because you would have to hold onto any gains you make through Fall.  Can you hold Rumania if you take it?  Or Sevastopol?  Think about not only the upcoming turn, but the one after that, and as many out as you can.  Not in any detail, because there is a lot that can happen.  I think you're doing so as you ask about what Austria would do if he takes Greece in the Spring.  It depends on what else he does besides taking Greece.  Even with a unit in  Greece and Russian help from Rumania, Austria cannot take Bulgaria without an additional unit.  In the current situation, Austria is going to need all the northern armies to defend against Italy's possible moves.  This is what you need to convince Austria.  Consider that your attacks on Greece may be antagonizing Austria--convincing him that you would not be a good neighbor.  With France looming, Austria may be happy to remain on the defensive in the Balkans--once Greece is secured--allowing the Turko-Russian war to smolder.  Doing so is in Austria's interest!  <br/>My focus as Turkey would be on minimizing potential losses.  That means protecting Ankara and Smyrna by standing off the Russian Army, and defending Bulgaria against the two units that can attack it.  My orders would be Con to Smy, Bla to Ank, Aeg S Bul, and Bul Hold (or support Ser to Rum--anything to misdirect Russia).  I'd be disappointed if both the moves to Con and Ank succeeded--because then Bulgaria would be at risk to a combined Russia-Austrian attack.  But I'd be more disappointed to lose a home supply center and then have to fight to retake it.  Part of the game is denying the enemy any moral or psychological victories.    <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303994/#Comment_303994" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-11T10:15:47+00:00" title="December 11, 2010 10:15AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mel,<br/><br/>Your comments make total sense; however, it is in looking forward to future possibilities that I get worried. Especially if I assume Austria-Russian collaboration as a worst-case scenario (as seems highly likely).<br/><br/>If I do a fully defensive order, as you recommend, I could lose the Black Sea, with no gains. If Russia keeps attacking, he will probably move into the Black Sea himself. Austria may move his fleet back into the Ionian and then the Eastern Med, by the end of the turn.<br/><br/>In that position, I would be surrounded and quickly taken out in future turns, with no options for expansion. My only hope is that Russia is forced to disband somewhere.<br/><br/>However, this is my first game of Diplomacy, so my ideas of what may happen in the future are poor guesses at best. Is this fear unfounded?<br/><br/>Russia seems willing to attack suicidally, and Austria has been attacking me every turn. Both Italy and Germany are too busy to do any damage to Austria (he can mostly likely stand off Italy, and stand a potential gain, simply by ordering Bohemia to Vienna and Trieste to Venice.

The mid-game strength of a 6-8 SC Austria is considerable due to the central location that allows quick growth to several directions at once.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304853/#Comment_304853" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-16T10:01:12+00:00" title="December 16, 2010 10:01AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If Austria is clearly dominant then you've got to establish an anti-Austria League!

Rum to Sev is intended to bounce Bla to Sev.

The more France does to delay the movement of that fleet the better it will be for you.  But Austria has time if France takes the time to roll up Rome.  <br/>The situation is similar to the 1901-02 situation!  Worse, of course, since Austria is in the Med.  But the most dangerous enemy course of action is a move to Armenia.  <br/>You can prevent it with Bla to Arm, but if Sevastopol doesn't go to Arm then you have left the Black Sea open to Rum to Bla.  An alternative would be use the fleets to protect Constantinople with a standoff of each other, while Con moves to Ankara.  If Russia moves to Armenia, you can use Ank to support Smy, and standoff Bul to Con with Bla to Con.  <br/>It's purely defensive.  <br/>Faced with a monolithic Russia-Austria alliance, and disorganized play from the other countries, a tenacious defense is a credible performance by Turkey.  <br/>At some point you may want to lash out in a high risk offensive, but I don't think now.  <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305409/#Comment_305409" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-21T12:23:35+00:00" title="December 21, 2010 12:23PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do you think that Moscow is dead, in this case?<br/><br/>I'm very confident that Moscow will be supported by England (StP), and Austria and Russia know and expect it as well.<br/><br/>However, there is a chance that Russia will be too scared to move out of Rumania to attack the Black Sea (I've tried to scare him about this, explaining that if he leaves and Austria steps in, that fleet is most likely lost).

Arm to Smy, Eas S Arm to Smy, Bul to Con, takes Smyrna.  <br/><br/>To save Smyrna you need to make the fight a 2v2 struggle, forcing Armenia to either support the attack (from Eas) or cut support (Arm to Ank).  That means Constantinople has to move to Ankara.  <br/><br/>As you have noted, even a successful attack on Sev is pointless as it allows the Russian army to retreat to Armenia.  <br/><br/>Moscow is not definitely doomed...but Sev to Mos supported by Ukr and War definitely succeeds, Rum to Sev stands off a potential Bla to Sev.  The hard decision for Austria-Russia would then be where to assume risk--Gal to Rum keeps Rumania in possession of the allies but might transfer control to Austria--not good fro Russia if Austria is tempted to keep Rumania.  Galicia and Serbia could self standoff over Rumania--blocking Bla to Rum, but then Serbia cannot support Bulgaria.  As Russia, I would be pushing for the self-standoff...but Austria is calling the shots.

I've got less than 24 hours until the next round, so please advise quickly, if you're interested in advising! This is it, now, for real.<br/><br/>Quick recap, since 1905:<br/><br/>Austria dominates in 1906, Russia recovers with Austria's help, Italy barely hangs on. As Turkey I (and my "teammate") outmaneuver our enemies and even grab Sevastopol.<br/><br/>In 1907, France comes in and grabs two territories from Austria (Rome and Greece), and I think relief is finally at hand! With France nearby messing up Austria's groove, Turkey has a chance to survive!<br/><br/>France isn't interested in grabbing any more territory, but just wants to sit in Greece. I tell her, "If you're just going to sit there, you might as well do something with that unit. How about you help Turkey by attacking this Austrian unit here?" France says sure, fine.<br/><br/>However, then France gives the order for that unit to hold. The combined Russian-Austrian attack goes through, and the Russian fleet sails into Constantinople. I have no idea why; France couldn't give any reasonable explanation either, so I don't think she does either, it was just a whim (she had nothing to gain by *not* helping me, after all).<br/><br/>Austria ends the Fall down *three* Supply Centres. He disbands... and disbands all his forces on his Western front. I don't know why, but Russia and Austria are absolutely hell-bent on taking Turkey down!

It looks pretty grim for Turkey.<br/><br/>We did send out a letter to both Russia and Austria telling them how they're throwing the game to the West by going after us rather than playing to win, but I doubt that'll change their minds (although we will see how it will or will not).<br/><br/>For reference, England and Germany are a super-solid alliance (they make moves for each other when one party can't make it), and France and England are more-or-less allied (the English fleet in the MAO is there "for French defense" - according to both France and England, go figure).<br/><br/>What can Turkey do?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306992/#Comment_306992" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-05T14:40:20+00:00" title="January  5, 2011  2:40PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At this point my main tactic is to convince Russia and Austria that if they keep fighting Turkey, they will throw the game to France and England.<br/><br/>Is this a valid analysis, do you think?

I'd expect talking to them will continue to get you nowhere - especially with them this apparently close to taking you out.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour best hope seems to be with the French. F Greece can at least make taking you down a slower and messier process. F Rome should certainly get moving into the Ionian (if it's not finishing off italy). Remind France that the longer you survive, the longer Austria's forces are out action against France.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince France seems both a timid player, and an alliance player, they might not wipe you out after they came into the Aegean. You'd be safer bordering them than bordering your current neighbors, or the English, anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoin the Western Alliance.

They have made a point of publicly stating that they want to see Turkey dead even if it means losing the game for them. (However, I believe that in the long-term the logic is working on them: more and more, they are beginning to focus more on their outer borders and disband units surrounding Turkey.)<br/><br/>However, a few things have delayed progress. First, Austria and Russia are far better tacticians than their opponents. When I have a chance to advise my opponents, they often do well. When I do not, or when they ignore tactical advice, they occasionally make major blunders. Overall, however, the tide of war is in their favour (France and England are pushing steadily Eastwards). Nevertheless, the next few years after that last picture saw France lose ground, retreating back to Marseilles!<br/><br/>Second, the Curious Case of Italy. Italy is played by two players (as is Turkey, since I miss an occasional game, but I tend to write the orders even when we're both there: my partner is happy to take the back seat and simply enjoy the game as a near-spectator).  Both are very unpredictable and sometimes irrational when playing (hence Italy's sorry fate up until now). However, they take turns attending the game, and one player is more interested in cooperating with France while the other seems capable of convincing France that he is cooperative but otherwise clearly sides with Russia/Austria. Very amusingly, he's been able to double-cross France three times in a row, and she still continues to trust him. I'm not sure why!<br/><br/>In addition, there's been some speculation about Russian/Austrian relations. No matter what happens with their alliance, it seems that Austria benefits and Russia takes the brunt of the losses. They both claim that their alliance is 100% solid, but there has been... speculation, as I said. At the last game (we play through one "year" at each game, weekly), Austria made a mistake in his written orders in both Spring and Fall, to Russia's loss. This also happened earlier, about two years ago. Still, both players seem certain that this was an accident and nothing more. <br/><br/>(I am working on Russia in this respect, however, trying to sow the seeds of doubt.)<br/><br/>It is a bizarre but entertaining game. So far I've had a fair bit of success steering some events through my "secret advisor", but just as often the people I'm advising ignore this "advice" and instead choose sub-par tactical play, to their loss. I am unsure why, since they do not write back to the "secret advisor". I've seen them ignore the tactical advice despite clearly having the same strategic agenda: perhaps it is a matter of pride? Perhaps they do not want to follow advice from a third party because then the game wouldn't be a test of their skills? Who knows.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312043/#Comment_312043" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-10T09:35:57+00:00" title="February 10, 2011  9:35AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, this might take me a while.

Some maps. I'll just do a few, in order to show what's gone in between 1907 (when we left off) and present-day (moving into 1913).<br/><br/>From the last map above, the most significant that happened is the following:<br/><br/>As Turkey, I continue to play a pretty much flawless defense (but, as you can imagine, losing Sevastopol), and encouraging England, France, and Germany to push as hard as possible against Russia and Austria, hoping that someday they will be forced to disband some more and give me some breathing room before they finally crack me.<br/><br/>See that Russian unit in Munich?<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://ihousenews.pbworks.com/f/Fall1907.gif"/><br/><br/>It gets pushed out of Munich and moves to Tyrolia. Then Russia gets Italy to agree to support him into Venice! Italy keeps playing France for a sucker, and pretty soon the Italian boot is occupied by two Russian armies (pushed down from the North by the Anglo-German forces) and two Italian armies, with France pushed back into Tuscany and Piedmont!<br/><br/>Fall 1908 looks like this:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://ihousenews.pbworks.com/f/Fall1908.gif"/><br/><br/>At the same time, I keep telling France and Austria about how important the Ionian is, since France getting control of the Ionian makes Austria unable to expand West, and Austria in the Ionian means he's moving away from Turkey. It works, kind of: Austria sends one fleet off into the Ionian and take Tunis. All this means that the French offensive gets pushed back even further. At one point, France falls down to five SCs!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312353/#Comment_312353" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-12T21:11:08+00:00" title="February 12, 2011  9:11PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now, Italy becomes a very entertaining place, because the two players take turns coming to the game, and have completely different ideas: one favours France while the other pretends to favour France but always backs Russia instead.<br/><br/>I keep playing the switcheroo in Turkey, and holding solidly onto my two SCs.<br/><br/>Here's Fall 1910:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://ihousenews.pbworks.com/f/Fall1910.gif"/><br/><br/>What's interesting? As England expands into Russia's territory, she lets roughly half (or more) of the gains go to her German ally, and he slowly starts building back up. By 1910, he's at a very respectable four units!<br/><br/>You can see how badly France did, in a number of ways. But here's where she finally ousted the Austrian from Tunis. In the next year, I convinced them to allow an English fleet into the MAO so they could simply crush the Austrian fleet in NAf. <br/><br/>I'm finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel: I could live another year or two!<br/><br/>I start sending out propaganda more aggressively, trying to convince Austria and Russia to turn on each other (to hilarious effect when Austria "misorders" several Russian supports, and then has to try to convince everyone they were simply errors--which, incidentally, I believe to be true), and also helping Germany England and France coordinate a little better against Russia and Austria, who are far better tactical players.<br/><br/>(For instance, how did Austria and Russia get the Italian situation to clear so easily? They realized that with the congestion of units they could force an attack on the English and French units stuck in Venice and Tyrolia and force them both to disband! It was pretty slick, and a surprise to everyone.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312355/#Comment_312355" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-12T21:29:47+00:00" title="February 12, 2011  9:29PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From here on, Austria grows at the expense of Russia, while France moves into a better offensive position (oh, so, so slowly and ineffeciently: for example, one year the Italian convinced her to support his army into Naples with BOTH of her fleets! Meanwhile he did ordered something else entirely... oh dear).<br/><br/>This is now the current map, Fall 1912, and the next session is in 48 hours.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://ihousenews.pbworks.com/f/Fall1912.gif"/><br/><br/>Interesting, huh?<br/><br/>Austria disclaims my propaganda about how he is secretly working to take out Russia, but the way things turn out, look, he's up and Russia's down! I honestly believe this may be "accidental", but I'm still working on building Russia's paranoia ("Austria's taking you out of the picture!"). Russia was at 5 units at the beginning of this year, when he saw one disband, lost Moscow to Austria (intentionally), Constantinople to France, and Rumania to England (via retreat from Sevastopol).<br/><br/>In case you're wondering where Russia's second SC is, it's Venice (he chose to disband). So he's effectively at one SC.<br/><br/>What happened in Turkey? This was kind of interesting. France actually misordered, and wrote "-&gt; Aegean" with one of her fleets when she meant to write "-&gt; Adriatic".<br/><br/>I decided to take advantage of this! I still had two units on the board in the Spring, Fleet Smyrna and Army Ankara. However, there was an Austrian fleet in the Black Sea and a Russian fleet in Constantinople, so I knew Ankara wasn't going to last long.<br/><br/>I told France to take advantage of the situation and attack Austria full-on: take Greece with one fleet while I support her into Constantinople with the other.<br/><br/>She went for it. Now I'm at one SC, but safe for the moment unless France decides to take me out. Even if Russia moves down to Armenia (via retreat, say), they cannot take Smyrna all that easily. I'll be encouraging France to take Bulgaria next turn (with English support) and then (hopefully) support me into Constantinople. If she doesn't support me, I'll still be able to bounce Austria there. <br/><br/>I'm also working really hard to get Italy into Venice and Army Galicia into Budapest "for its own survival", forcing the Austrian to disband a unit (who knows, maybe he'll choose Fleet Ankara? Eventually he will have to, I hope).<br/><br/>In this situation, I believe Turkey actually has a chance to survive. What do you think? This is such a strange board, and such a strange game. What will happen next?<br/><br/>My plan is still to encourage the Western Alliance by feeding them the best possible moveset to keep pushing on Austria (I'll try to get them to crush Silesia in the Spring and then move into Budapest or Serbia in the Fall).<br/><br/>I'll also try to encourage them NOT to make a supported attack on Venice until the Fall, hoping to draw an Austrian unit into there in the Spring.<br/><br/>What do you think of all this? Wacky, for sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312356/#Comment_312356" name="Item_112" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-12T21:34:19+00:00" title="February 12, 2011  9:34PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, one more detail: <br/><br/>While Germany/England are super-stable (at least for now; what the heck should Germany do next, once the war starts winding down?), England and France are NOT terribly solid as an alliance but show no interest in attacking each other.

Diplomacy is in a very real sense over once everybody's made up their minds, with only tactical play left to execute. This is the norm for end-game play - and is in fact a good definition of when end-game begins.<br/><br/>I suppose that the reverse is a fair strategy for Turkey here as well: work to develop a good French relationship, promise to build only armies (insofar as the French player cares; they don't seem to get offended by anything their allies do), then kick out the Austrian from your lands. As you already said, you have a fair shot at Constantinople with French support when the French fleet departs, after all. If you get an army, you can get Ankara back as well, at which point you'll be truly cooking: the Russo-Austrian lines have been shattered and the entire eastern part of the board is in chaos, while Germany is surely finding out that his only route onwards involves turning against France or England. This wholesale chaos should by rights enable you to cooperate with Italy (another down-trodden, albeit schitzophrenic Power), which might give you a shot at expanding your domain in Austrian and Russian lands over the next five years or so. Even a small Power can make surprisingly quick gains in chaotic areas by playing the Powers against each other, so I wouldn't despair yet in your case: just get your home SCs under control and start supporting the westerners against Russo-Austrians. But make sure that Germany and Italy are ready to stab England and France; your shot at victory here involves ensuring that the Franco-English are unable to take benefit once the strategic backbone of the Russo-Austrians breaks. If you can time an Italo-German betrayal of their western masters to coincide with the moment when you're confident of being able to beat the Russo-Austrians yourself, all the better.<br/><br/>All of the above is, of course, a pipe-dream when everybody seems to be playing more or less randomly. Still, a man can dream.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312389/#Comment_312389" name="Item_116" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-13T13:55:42+00:00" title="February 13, 2011  1:55PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>Agreed.

I sent a "secret" plan through my anonymous advisor to Italy and France which involved drawing Austria into Venice and then forcing him to disband there, while simultaneously counseling England and Germany on the best way to attack Russia and Austria.<br/><br/>All of those things worked really well! France and Italy both attacked Austria, but in such a way that no one can tell they're allied. Unfortunately, I also wanted France to convoy Tuscany -&gt; Albania, and she convoyed Marseilles -&gt; Tunis instead, which means Turkish relief as a little further away than planned.<br/><br/>Germany and England pushed hard and full-on against Austria and Russia, taking Moscow, Bohemia, and Budapest.<br/><br/>France took Bulgaria, and I took Constantinople. However, in the Fall, Austria convoyed Russia (from Sevastopol) into Constantinople! I had moved to cover Ankara, so Turkey is now back to two SCs. But it seems Austria/Russia is still fully committed to taking down Turkey, which is frustrating. Is there any way I can give them enough hope about their situation "back home" to stop this pogrom? It's getting rather ridiculous. They made no effort to hold on to Sevastopol and Moscow (which they could have done).<br/><br/>The final result: <br/><br/>* Italy retakes Venice and builds a fleet. <br/>* England takes Budapest and Warsaw, building an army in London (is this heading to France? who knows).<br/>* France stays put, but moves East, with an army in Tunis.<br/>* Russia moves South.<br/>* Austria loses three armies (one to a forced disband in the Spring, and then two disbands at the end of the Fall)<br/><br/>Map to come.<br/><br/>Things will be shaking more soon. If I can encourage Italy and Germany to put some action against France and England in the near future, Turkey may actually have a chance to grow and rebuild. Unfortunately, my enemies are stubborn: they have an army (Russian) in Constantinople, and a fleet (Austrian) in the Black Sea, and don't seem likely to give up anytime soon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312887/#Comment_312887" name="Item_118" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-16T11:07:42+00:00" title="February 16, 2011 11:07AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 16, 2011 11:11AM by Paul_T.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I don't have access to the physical board, so this one is from memory, but we just played last night, so I think it's correct (at most, there might be one unit out of place):<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://ihousenews.pbworks.com/f/Fall1913.gif"/><br/><i><br/>Edit: For clarification -- Sevastopol and Trieste are Austrian, Naples is Italian, Germany has Denmark.

Then feast yourself on Austro-Russian spoils while the two large alliances duke it out among themselves. Because you're advicing the two power-blocks via separate identities, they won't realize that you're provoking a fight; even to England and Germany it'll just seem like they're part of a tri-partite alliance with Turkey against France and Italy. Play the two blocks against each other and each Power within each block against their ally while expanding your own domains aggressively; try to catch everybody flat-footed by your dynamic growth.<br/><br/>If Austria and Russia prove completely intractable - that is, their moves and reasoning are anti-rational and they're hostile to Turkey despite all efforts - then your best bet in the long term is to destroy them in a way that allows you to become a substantial beneficiary of the destruction. To achieve this you need to use the other Powers to put so much pressure on Austro-Russians that whatever strength you have left to yourself actually becomes sufficient for conquest within their domains. If you allow the other Powers too easy a ride, however, the result will be that they'll integrate the Austro-Russian domain into their own lands, which is why you need to lay the groundwork for a north vs. south war early on. Even on the same turn as they make the final attacks on Austro-Russians, other forces need to be on the move for a decisive provocation that'll justify dropping everything in the east to focus on the final war in the west.<br/><br/>In practice you'll want to take back your home SCs, of course, and follow that up with control of the Black Sea and environs. The strategic situation requires you to be both land- and sea-based Power, so build accordingly. Leverage a fleet in Bla as support and convoy for quick army marches to Sev, Rum and Bul; the strategic position on Bla should allow you to reign locally supreme against what little Austro-Russians can scare up. Argue with the other Powers that the Black Sea environs are a natural Turkish possession and make what lies you have to to get a firm grasp on the Sev-Rum-Bul line, all armies. Once you have this position you'll be able to consider: attack the stronger of Austria and Russia at that point (likely Austria, as Russia's likely lost all his SCs at that point unless he manages to take something from the northern alliance) and try to achieve a forward-moving momentum that balances your front commitments between the northern alliance and southern alliance: you don't want to conquer positions that leave you only able to project force against one or the other, but rather you'll prefer to hold equal ability to influence both sides.<br/><br/>So pretty much what I said last time. It'll take a while to execute the modernization of Turkey under the new Ataturk regime, so be patient. Your new Power will be more modern and more dynamic than the Ottoman dynasty ever could be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313575/#Comment_313575" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-21T20:05:55+00:00" title="February 21, 2011  8:05PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>Questions:<br/><br/>1. Germany/England is pretty stable, but Italy/France is not (both are very unpredictable players, and they have a history of screwing each other over).<br/><br/>What do you think of my alternate idea of enticing England to attack Germany (it will be effectively surrounded by English forces), and France to attack Italy (again, because French units are right now maneuvering to effectively surround Italy). I know France is into this idea; I'm less sure about England/Germany.<br/><br/>Finally, a surprise English offensive against France will cause France to disband, which I hope (and I think reasonably expect) will likely take place on my borders.<br/><br/>Is this plan less likely than what you're suggesting, or somehow less effective?<br/><br/>2. When you say "dynamic growth" for Turkey, should I be expanding as quickly as I can at this point? I'm hoping for Constantinople this year, of course, and then moving into the Aegean and the Black Sea as quickly as possible. But will growing too quickly draw too much attention? I've seen you successfully remain a "weak" power for long periods of time and then suddenly grow to great strength (e.g. in the SG game when you were playing Italy). Is this a strategy you intentionally cultivate? Is it something I should be concerned about in this game, as well?<br/><br/>Finally, if you have any particular tactical comments for this coming year, they're welcome! Right now my main objective is to give effective combat orders to all involved, and orient Austria/Russia towards reclaiming Budapest and/or Bulgaria, and occupying Sevastopol immediately. But they're the least likely to listen to my advice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313579/#Comment_313579" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-21T22:05:39+00:00" title="February 21, 2011 10:05PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding Germany and England, I would expect that there are some pretty heavy metagame considerations operating in why England has allowed Germany to exist and prosper here. Unless I misremember, Germany survived in the game only due to English largesse at some point. For this reason it's very difficult for me to say whether England would be willing to attack Germany. I would also not necessarily see this as a good match-up from your viewpoint: you want England to engage France because that's a more difficult and slower war that is not as likely to result in advantage for England. Attacking Germany would only make England a real soloist contender, especially if other Powers did not interfere to aid Germany.<br/><br/>What you ultimately want to happen in the west is for everybody to be as similar in strength as everybody else, and everybody to be as suspicious of each other as possible, and everybody to be more concerned about their neighbours than they are of whatever happens in the east. You do not want them to engage in successful wars. (All this with the understanding that you need to use the westerners to tie up Austro-Russian forces while you build up from your own modest position into an eastern superpower.)<br/><br/>As for your own growth plan, you should grow in a manner that seems fait accompli in retrospect for everybody else, and in a manner that enables your forces to continuously remain in dynamic positions (positions that allow them the freedom of further engagement, that is, rather than positions that require them to hunker down in defense). This is why I suggest looking into the Black Sea, as it's natural for Turkey in a similar way that the Nordic area is for England, for example - the SCs around it support each other, and a single fleet allows you to support whichever area most needs aid. This is better than something like going for Greece after your home SCs, as the further growth opportunities from Greece are worse.<br/><br/>Drawing attention to yourself is of course a problem, especially if there are irrational metagame considerations on the table (such as the common "this guy always wins in boardgames, let's attack him all together at the first hint of success" social dynamic). It would have to be an exceptional situation for me to completely willingly remain weak, however. I'd rather characterize the relationship of the strong player with his weak position as one of acceptance and patience; you remain weak and do not make the mistake of striking at the first obvious opportunity, for you want to build dynamic, powerful strength, not merely to grab at the first SC you see. This might seem like a player is intentionally remaining weak, but the inner truth is rather that he's chosen to forgo the currently available options because he finds them illusory.<br/><br/>In your particular situation taking back your home SCs is a no-brainer, as it establishes you as a reliable Power that is still very much in the game, and hungry for further victories. Because Russia and Austria are not reliable players my choice would not be to wait and see and build up strength carefully; I would much rather seek immediate opportunities with French and English support, crippling the Austro-Russians at the first opportunity. Tacticals are very much dependent on the diplomacy in a chaotic situation like this, but assuming that the above map is current, you might consider attacking Ank-Con (with French support, ideally); if you could build a second fleet in Ankara, you'd have a good handle on the Black Sea, which I view as much more important to you than the Aegean Sea. The French player is weak-willed and unlikely to stab you, from what I've seen, so in your stead I'd take the risks involved in baring my southern borders completely as I strike for the Black Sea and its surrounding SCs. In fact, you probably should be laying groundwork for having France relinquish Bulgaria for you, assuming you can't cause the Austro-Russians to outright take it from him so you can take it yourself later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313612/#Comment_313612" name="Item_123" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-22T06:26:45+00:00" title="February 22, 2011  6:26AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>Excellent advice.

They have some kind of hate for Turkey, I don't know why (outside the game we're good friends, but whenever we show up to play, they won't even talk to me, although once they said, "Okay, we have peace, but only if you don't attack Austria" -- at a time when Austria was occupying Constantinople).<br/><br/>Honestly, I wouldn't be that surprised if I saw a convoy of Rumania -&gt; Armenia next Spring!<br/><br/>So, overall, I am rather encouraging France to establish some forces in the Balkans and then push North and West, taking out Austria and then Italy. Army Tunis is intended as a convoy into Albania next year, for example.<br/><br/>It seems to me that France is less of a threat, also, because it won't be too hard to get Italy, England, or even Germany to attack, and she's so defensive of her "homeland" that such a distraction should be more than enough to allow me to expand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313922/#Comment_313922" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-23T11:30:19+00:00" title="February 23, 2011 11:30AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the meantime, if anyone would like to try their hand at a plan for a potential stab by Germany, Italy, England, or France within the next year or two, feel free to post here, and we'll discuss.<br/><br/>Particularly, I'm wondering how England might best get all those Nordic units into action in Europe against Germany or France, without immediately tipping them off.<br/><br/>I'm currently working on a plan for France to encircle Italy and take her out (thereby hopefully vacating the Balkans).<br/><br/>My strategy will depend largely on continued Western gains, and the fact that builds for England and France will be happening far away, and not able to replace destroyed Austrian and Russian units quickly enough to keep that entire area occupied.

(The justification for English fleets moving towards the Mediterranean will be the fear of an Italian fleet making it through the French lines into, say, Gulf of Lyons or Western Med. This is logic which, while very flawed, I suspect will actually work on France, as similar ploys have before.)<br/><br/>Fall<br/><br/>Keep making gains on land, working with Germany and France. For the other units:<br/><br/>GoB -&gt; Sweden<br/>Bar -&gt; Norway<br/>Nth Sea -&gt; Eng or Belgium<br/>Eng -&gt; MAO (or West Med, if it's already in the MAO)<br/>Belgium -&gt; Holland<br/><br/>The rationale being that this puts all the units in position for a serious attack on either Germany or France. England is a good liar, and both Germany and France trust her. So my suggestion to her will be to tell France that she's gearing up for an attack on Germany (with a few anti-French moves just for misdirection), and to tell Germany that she's moving West for an assault on France. Justification for all these various moves is quite possible (for instance, she can tell Germany that Belgium -&gt; Holland is a fleet movement designed to make it possible to convoy an army from England through the North Sea into Belgium next year, while also misleading France into thinking she's moving against Germany).<br/><br/>From that position, she should be able to make either attack quite successfully, and she can decide which. If she goes against Germany, I'll encourage France simultaneously to attack Italy and/or start moving against England while she's distracted. If England goes against France, I can encourage Germany to get involved by attack Italy or (more likely) turn around to ally with France against England, who now has a shot at a solo victory.<br/><br/>All pretty foolish logic, of course, but I think it'll work on this particular group. Similar "plans" have been successful in the past.<br/><br/>And the goal of it all is to create a bit of a vacuum around Turkey that I can hopefully expand into. I'll try hard to make sure that Austria and Russia are dead or nearly so by that point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316077/#Comment_316077" name="Item_127" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-09T15:58:36+00:00" title="March  9, 2011  3:58PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well!<br/><br/>The game is back on, and we played through two more years last night.

Shame about Russia, but if that's what it takes to get you out of your corner, it's worthwhile. Note, however, that the other players are probably starting to feel the length of the game now that Russia's done, and they might start thinking in wrap-up terms: they'll be less likely to shift alliances and more likely to play for keeps in their clashes. This means that you need to step up vigorously to fight yourself into a dominant position before the events advance too much for you to have an influence anymore.<br/><br/>The board seems very favourable to an Austrian alliance to me, so if the diplomacy allows, perhaps that's what you should arrange. Promise the Austrian everything north of Rum-Bud-Tri, while you take Bulgaria, Serbia and Greece. You can specifically and immediately help the Austrian in putting pressure on Sevastopol. The Austrian fleet in Bla is a minor issue, but Austria would be suicidal to stab you now - not impossible all things considered, but if he feels his mortality now, I would trust him in the short term. Long-term the Austrian fleet can be disbanded, of course, or parked in Sevastopol out of your hair. With Russia gone there's no reason why this sort of alliance couldn't continue to the end-game, or terminate with your own bid for the Austrian lands later on, all according to your needs.<br/><br/>France is going to fall quickly now, as you probably can't afford to delay capturing Bul and Gre. Were I you, I'd pull out all stops on diplomacy to screw up the French partitioning: get Italy to focus on Austrian lands, strike a wedge between Germany and England, whatever it takes to give France a breather. Saving France is of course difficult if the French player is pitiful of skill and will, so it's possible that you'll have to give it up as a lost cause and start preparing groundwork for the Anglo-Italian war that comes next: you absolutely need to ensure that Italy beats on England hard before you yourself are ready to attack Italy's back, as otherwise England will remain much too strong in the end-game.<br/><br/>As for your questions: no solo for England without stabbing Germany, unless Germany actively colludes to throw victory to England. France with Italian support needs to negotiate a trade of Marseilles for Spain and then arrange forces to break through to the Atlantic - try to get into possession of home SCs and MAO, then recapture Iberia from Italy or England. For Turkish builds, I'd go for either one or two armies, with the intent to move to the Balkans and then choose between attacking Austria and attacking Italy later; the Austrian fleet in Bla is not crucial if Austria can be talked into moving it to a coastal area. Ideally you'll move your own fleet to Bla and have the Austrian fleet on a coastal area where it's basically a weaker army for most purposes; a smart Austrian will seek to disband the fleet, anyway, as you're his only sensible ally and he doesn't need the fleet against others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316170/#Comment_316170" name="Item_131" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-10T12:53:34+00:00" title="March 10, 2011 12:53PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm fairly positive the Austrian will now be my ally.

If Germany and England fall apart, it will be easy, of course, but if they remain allied Moscow can move to Warsaw and/or Berlin can move southward. Italian and French cooperation is always dicey: they aren't fully trusting of anyone, and France may turn entirely hostile after I take Bul and Gre. <br/><br/>I'm guessing the best course of Northward attack might be an attempt on Munich (via Burgundy and Tyrolia). But it depends on heavy cooperation from France and Italy, and they just aren't reliable. Italy, particularly, seems to take joy in making surprising and unorthodox moves.

Their very next build was an army in Rome.)<br/><br/>I'm going to be sending out a major "communique" to all the countries detailing the current situation, and hopefully this will have an impact.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316176/#Comment_316176" name="Item_132" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-10T13:10:06+00:00" title="March 10, 2011  1:10PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anything that makes others play in sane ways as opposed to insane ways is usually good for the players who rely on skill instead of luck.<br/><br/>Attacking England and Germany has to work, there are no alternatives: saying that it's not feasible is the same as saying that those two have a free rein expanding their dominions on the expense of the rest of the board, which is the same as victory for one of them whenever they get around to stabbing the other. Thus it's better to assume that a way is there if only you can find it. In this particular position England and Germany have only a 50/50 defense against Austria and Turkey in Sev and Gal, as Ukraine cannot support them both. Admittedly Austria (and by extension the whole eastern front) is fucked if Italy decides to stab him in the back, but that's the vagaries of war; you're probably better off explaining to the other players very carefully what they should do and then assuming that they will do it rather than assuming that you're fucked right off the start.<br/><br/>Worst comes to worst, your fall-back position will probably be the same its been for the whole game: defend, defend and talk everybody else into playing at least well enough to bring the game into a sharp three-way draw with you in it. Even if Italy stabs Austria and France just forgets to breathe and dies, this outcome should be doable against any non-colluding opposition on this board. (The probable three-way from this position would be EIT, incidentally, assuming everybody plays even somewhat sensibly - Germany's automatically out as long as England has the superior tactical position.) The only truly major concern from your viewpoint is an English solo victory, against which you sadly don't have many tools aside from diplomacy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316184/#Comment_316184" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-10T13:50:05+00:00" title="March 10, 2011  1:50PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>Are you overlooking one detail?<br/><br/>Moscow will most likely be supporting Sevastopol.<br/><br/>We've tried to convince Germany NOT to order the support, but so far he hasn't.

However, if Ukraine supports Sevastopol, then Rumania might attack Galicia instead with support from Budapest (or vice versa), expanding the front and pinching the Russian contingent of the Germano-English forces. Sevastopol might also attack Rumania as a defensive measure, but you might also play Arm-Sev or Bla-Sev, who knows.<br/><br/>The point is, they have only four armies in the theatre, while Austria and Turkey together have four as well; this is no static front, either side might well advance with smart tactics. The specific geography favours your side, as you have lots of strength situated against Sevastopol while the enemy is unable to attack both Armenia and Black Sea. The situation is in fact pretty analogous to my Russian war in our forum game just now, where I advanced against Warsaw and capitalized on the fact that the Russian rear position army in Sevastopol couldn't participate in offensive operations very effectively. I'm not saying that you'll advance all the way with just the forces shown, but if either you or Austria can bring even one more unit to this front after f.eg. conquering Sevastopol or bringing a Turkish army north, then there's no reason why you couldn't take everything up to the Baltic coast - not at least if Germany doesn't bring more forces to the eastern front, of course.<br/><br/>Every one of your potential attacks can be countered by the enemy with the proper moves, but this is not the same as a successful defense; for that the enemy would need to be able to block all possible attack vectors simultaneously, and for this the shown forces are not sufficient. As things stand you might misguess as to which attack will go through, but the attacker has the luxury of guessing again on the next turn.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316192/#Comment_316192" name="Item_135" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-10T14:26:47+00:00" title="March 10, 2011  2:26PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2011 2:28PM by Paul_T.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Eero.<br/><br/>That certainly makes sense.

Of course the trick is in when each individual Power will find it advantageous to split from the party line, and you might suffer a diplomatic backlash yourself later, but some grand narrative like that, with joint strategic planning as well, might be pretty powerful in ensuring that France and Italy work with you instead of against you. Usually when you get four players together for strategy talks nobody dares to betray the rest, and thus everybody ends up moving the way you agreed communally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316211/#Comment_316211" name="Item_137" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-10T16:46:39+00:00" title="March 10, 2011  4:46PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good advice, thank you!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316798/#Comment_316798" name="Item_138" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-16T09:14:27+00:00" title="March 16, 2011  9:14AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another year under the bridge!<br/><br/>I sent out heavy propaganda from the "anonymous advisor", suggesting that England is on the verge of victory, and only Germany stands in her way. How will England and Germany deal with this dilemma? They are allies, but each can only ensure his or her chances of winning by turning on the other. Etc.<br/><br/>The propaganda laid out a plan for Southern cooperation, as well.<br/><br/>How did it work? Kind of. Germany and England maintained a solid alliance, working together on every front. But there were a few strange movements: England brought a fleet back to the Irish Sea, moved another fleet to Livonia. Is she preparing to reinforce her holdings against a possible German stab (e.g. St. Petersburg)?<br/><br/>The Southern allies held closely together, for the most part. Austria is completely on board with Turkey, so we could coordinate quite well. First we pushed England out of Galicia and Sevastopol, then forced the English army that had in the meantime made its way into Rumania to disband. However, this may have been a lucky coincidence: Italy moved Trieste -&gt; Serbia at the same time as England did, making retreat for that army impossible.<br/><br/>Was Italy acting in Austria's best interests, or just trying to grab Serbia?

You can afford to make the deal as attractive as possible - for example, agree that you'll only claim Sev and Rum once compensatory SCs are well in hand. Also suggest to him that this is a good opportunity for disbanding that fleet. The goal of your alliance should be to outright control the Austrian and Russian SCs, and the Balkans, or as much of these as possible before the northern alliance puts down a trench. As for Italy and the Balkans, convince the Austrian that a Turkish army in Albania or Serbia is necessary for safeguarding against Italy. The ultimate distribution of SCs you'll want is to basically have you hold the entire Balkans and the Black Sea environs, while Austria trades these possessions for front-line ground in Russia and Germany. Every SC you manage to trade in this way ties the Austrian into a static defense against the Anglo-German alliance, increasing your own security and options. Later in the game you'll want to stab the Austrian and attack west on the Mediterranean, after all, so your mid-term goal should meanwhile be to build up both Austria and Italy by providing them with SCs in the west: anything that will make it impossible for Germany, France and England to make peace with them later is to your advantage. Avoid outright threatening the others, but if you think they can handle the realpolitik, by all means remind them that if Turkey can find no expansion by supporting its neighbours and trading himself growth, he is capable of other means as well.<br/><br/>As for the west, the Franco-Italian situation is desperate, and those two should know it - they need to play so good a defense that either England or Germany comes to perceive that their individual interest lies in attacking the other instead of the well-defended, tenacious south. Diplomacy counts here more than tactics as long as the tactics are at least mediocre: England and Germany, separately from each other, should both be receiving constant messages from all directions, all cajoling, threatening and convincing them to turn on each other. If their alliance stands the inevitable outcome in the long run is an English solo victory (or a three-way draw with Turkey at best, although I find this unlikely), and there's very little that can be done in this regard with mere tactics as long as their alliance remains effective.<br/><br/>Strategically, what you need to do is to improve the southern defense against the north across the board: get Italy and Austria to sit down together with you, for example, and negotiate the Italian out of Trieste: explain to them that the position is simply too volatile, as Italy has shown a willingness to play a "wild" game and the army in Trieste is constantly in danger of utterly ruining the eastern part of the anti-northern front. This is not a funny or clever thing to do, causing the Austro-Turkish part of the line to crumble will only lead to extreme Anglo-German domination followed by a (probably) English stab on Germany for solo victory. Your main offer to Italy in this context should be the understanding that the Austro-Turkish portion of the board is utterly committed to increasing and maintaining pressure against the Germans and English forces in the east, which development will ultimately allow the Franco-Italian forces in the west to triumph as well; reducing pressure on either side will allow the northerners to consolidate forces and overcome the other side as well. For this reason it's to everybody's advantage if the French and Italian forces enact a controlled, well-thought retreat from Austrian positions and towards Germany. Once Austria is in safe control of his own SCs he can be a major aid to the war effort, considering how safe Italy is from Austria and how large a vested interest Austria has in pushing the northerners all the way to StP. The southern Powers still hold a slight majority of the board, so theoretically you four should be able to push back the northerners with time, provided you play a restrained and rational game all around.<br/><br/>(My own experience is that in any group of four players there is always one who thinks that he's being oh so clever by not dancing to the tune of the consensus, so probably one of your southern Powers will also feel here that they'll somehow benefit from betraying everybody to the English. That's life, and at least you'll get to crow about it later when the English solo if you establish early on that your only chance is to work together until the Anglo-German alliance breaks down.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316823/#Comment_316823" name="Item_141" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-16T11:04:10+00:00" title="March 16, 2011 11:04AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quite right, Eero.

I'm unaware of many messages sent by anyone to anyone throughout this whole game (I only know of two: one I sent myself, and another that Russia sent at the beginning to Italy, which didn't work).<br/><br/>That said, what kind of messages might be sent? There's little anyone can do to really threaten England and Germany; neither can anyone make any useful offers to them. I'm working on war propaganda, convincing everyone that the inevitable outcome WILL be one of them to turn on the other, but otherwise I'm not sure what I can do.<br/><br/>Right now the only real area for progress I can see is English progress on Spain and maybe Marseilles.

The game space is two adjoining rooms, so even when people are making plans, it's easy for other people to overhear.

Of course neither of these evaluations may withstand the realities of cat-herding, but if everybody were to play consistently and neither north or south gets decisively better in tactics, I'd expect the ultimate theoretical stalemate (what happens if nobody switches sides, that is) to end up 19-15 in favour of the four southern Powers. Takes perhaps 3-5 years to get there, of course, and a lot can happen in that time.<br/><br/>(If the northerners overpower the south tactically in the west, they could force the matter in Spa-Mar, in which case the theoretical stalemate would be achieved at clean 17-17, as the Mediterranean situation stabilizes in the Tyrhenian area. Not a great difference for the whole board, as the two northerners can't actually declare solo victory merely by reaching 18 SCs. Even losing Tunis wouldn't be crucial for stalemating the situation provided that the right mix of forces is entered into Italy well in advance of the approaching northern troops - as we discussed at the end of the recent forum game here, the Ion-Nap-Rom-Tun-Pie line is very defensible from the east. Mostly this doesn't really matter as long as they are stopped <i>somewhere</i>: the real issue whether the Anglo-German alliance can be breached, and how, not what that alliance might manage to conquer before the breakup.)<br/><br/>The sort of play culture you describe is very unfavourable to the Grand Alliance, which at best of times is sorely pressed by the need to coordinate several players. The opposing side is fortunately also divided here, but the challenge of playing a perfect defense is still severe, especially when you don't really have much of a clue as to when and why England and Germany might finally be enticed to stab each other; with experienced players I'd say that England will take Germany out any moment now, before the Grand Alliance has entirely cohered against him, but your game has been so chaotic that I'd expect anything ranging from an immediate futile German stab to outright collusion for English victory.<br/><br/>Were I playing in this environment I'd probably come to the table with prepared move-sheets for the Grand Alliance, ready to discuss the matter with the others. First convince them of the necessity to coordinate over the entire board, then provide everybody with the rough strategic thinking behind the plan, then give everybody ready-made move recommendations for their own part, and finish by taking questions and emphasizing that any single Power among the four southerners may easily fuck up the entire defense by trying to be clever, and you'd rather just see everybody work together until the Anglo-German alliance breaks up. There's no guarantee that the other players will actually follow your advice, but at least an authoritative line with pre-thought tactics will ensure that nobody will fail to play smartly due to miscommunication. If it works, just rinse and repeat until the northern alliance breaks and/or Turkey gets a shot at soloing.<br/><br/>Regarding the diplomacy towards the northerners, I would personally approach it by feeding messages to the other southern Powers: everybody should offer both England and Germany independently their own best deal, whatever it might be locally. There's no need for this stuff to make tactical sense, even, as long as it's clear that the southerners are afraid and willing to deal with whoever will listen to them; the idea is to transmit the fact that the south is aware of the threat of the northern alliance and is reacting in fear, willing to set aside their own disagreements to stubbornly defend against the north, but they'll also do almost anything to make friends with either England or Germany. (In reality they shouldn't of course compromise their tactical position just because England or Germany promises them something - were I playing the north, I would of course consistently promise whatever the individual southern Powers want, but with no intent to fulfill any promises that would weaken my hand.)<br/><br/>Once you have the above sort of diplomatic activity going, the next step is to transmit some southern alliance propaganda: the northerners each should realize that there is a board-wide southern alliance movement in existence, it's self-aware and committed to stopping the northern duopoly from expanding. This starts putting on pressure on the two to rethink their individual priorities, as they'll realize that they can't expect much to accrue to them out of a war with the entire south. For this reason you want the above step to be kept up and convincing: the northerners need to feel both that the south is in control and able to stop them militarily, but also that each individual southerner is afraid and very willing to deal with them. The logical conclusion for both England and Germany separately is that they need to sucker a southern Power or several into negotiations and even new wars that cause confusion and help break the developing stalemate. From your viewpoint the goal here is to make sure that whether any such developmens are intended seriously or not, the resulting outcome is a breakup between England and Germany.<br/><br/>Once you have the above two steps in play, you start talking specifics with England and Germany: they need to realize that every turn played brings the game closer to a static stalemate, they need to realize that every turn played is more time for the southern alliance to learn from their mistakes, learn to trust each other and learn to keep up the pressure on the north. Above all, they need to realize that every turn as the pressure on the frontlines mounts the expected value of a stab within the northern alliance is increasing: the more forces both northern Powers need to commit to the board-wide frontlines, the less are needed by either to take a totally conclusive victory against the other. This means that the immediate value of taking the initiative in inter-northern aggression is rising constantly - whoever first turns on the other will have a great advantage both diplomatically (as they can set up the betrayal with the appropriate southern allies in advance) and tactically (as they can seize SCs and military zones with minimal investment by relying on surprise instead of force). Also, they need to realize that the closer they get to absolute hegemony of the board, the closer they necessarily get to a situation where one of them has to stab the other to win the game: there is only one victor in Diplomacy, and as long as they don't have a southern ally willing to arrange a three-way draw, their only road forward from a stalemated situation is by stabbing the other. It does not really matter who tells these things to Germany and England as long as they are sharply and convincingly communicated. Truth is here on your side, as it usually is in Diplomacy for anybody willing to play the game's logic to its conclusion.<br/><br/>Regarding the tactical situation, it is true that all meaningful gains at this point in the game are long-term, as they take several years of set-up and development to achieve. This should not be an argument for abandoning the effort, however. In a really concrete way you've already lost the game if Italy, for example, cannot be made to see that taking a SC from Austria and causing a disband of an Austrian army is only going to advance the northern military position, thus allowing the north to send more forces against Italy itself pretty soon. This fact has to penetrate the southern Powers' leadership if any sort of serious endgame coalition is to be formed; the best play in absense of this sort of coordination is really to merely bitch at the cretins when they fail to stop the northern alliance.<br/><br/>Given the above point, and assuming that the southern Powers are at least capable of listening to well-formed arguments, the best tactical play of the moment probably involves Tyr-Pie, Tri-Tyr to preserve Marseilles and reduce the temptations in Austria. Meanwhile, a Turkish fleet needs to move west to prevent an English end-run through NAf, and Turkish armies need to be brought up to support the Austrian forces more actively. Perhaps trade Sevastopol for Bulgaria to get more armies to the frontlines - whatever it takes diplomatically to put more boots on the ground, really. The strategic objectives in the area are increased pressure on Munich (helps the Marseilles situation) and eventual seizing of War-Mos from the northern alliance, but both of those goals are relatively distant and need to be worked on one step at a time. Get France to relinquish the useless position in Vienna to Austria, for example, and use that French army to take ground in the Boh-Sil corridor. That sort of thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316842/#Comment_316842" name="Item_144" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-16T13:28:20+00:00" title="March 16, 2011  1:28PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent writeup, Eero.

The southern alliance can still cause all sorts of difficulty by playing pre-emptive moves to delay the process while reinforcements race to the scene; for example, a simple Wes-NAf could be very effective if England truly is trying to seize position instead of Spain on the next move. This is the heart of tactical play in Diplomacy, and it's very difficult: you need to get inside the head of the other player and accept within your own head that you're at best going to get two thirds of the situations right - and it might be much worse if your evaluation of the opponent's thinking is off the mark. As the game has gone on for so long already you should be in a good position to think of how the Englishman (and the northern alliance in general) thinks: will they realize the importance of position here, or will they attack Spain directly?<br/><br/>Ultimately you might have to abandon the Spa-Mar line (and France as a Power, in all likelyhood) and retreat to hold Tunis in good order, but I wouldn't go for that without at least trying to outguess the opposition first. As I noted above, the strategic impact is not decisive, as the fact remains that the southerners can't break ranks as long as the northern alliance remains solid, and the north cannot win the game without the south breaking ranks, so the onus is on one of the southerners to throw the game by stabbing their ally, or on one of the northerners to realize the situation and stab the other. (I'm being ironic in case it's not clear - only fuckwits throw a game others are playing seriously.) But be that as it may, the fact remains that you should move reinforcements west to either successfully stopgap Gibraltar, or at least to seize Tunis and fortify to defend Italy if that fails.<br/><br/>Considering the Russian situation, my estimate above is mostly a gut feel from the visuals of the board. Taking a closer look, it seems to me that the northerners are pretty unable to bring armies to the eastern front due to their heavy fleet concentration and commitments in France. This in turn means that even if it takes a while, you should be able to advance against mere five armies in the area with a potential seven armies or more of your own, although the issues of inter-Power coordination are surely considerable. Still, once the Rumanian fleet is replaced by an army, the northern positions in Ukr-Gal-Boh become ultimately untenable: you will be able to assault Galicia from three points while cutting flank supports, or attack the flanks in Bohemia and Ukraine in case the enemy opts for an active defense. Once Galicia is taken, Ukraine and Bohemia are both under heavy pressure, and the enemy would need two three-unit army groups to hold both positions. What's worse for the enemy is that at that point you'll surely have extra armies available so you can actually opt to widen the front aggressively: they'll have to be careful of allowing raider units to break into eg. Prussia, while you'll hold the definite offensive edge. Finally, once you have Boh-Gal-Ukr in hand, the enemy will need to have seven <i>armies</i> in specific positions to answer all defensive commitments - an impossible position without bringing in substantial reinforcements they do not currently have on the board.<br/><br/>The above is a given as long as the northern alliance opts for a passive defensive strategy in the area - just a matter of time. Assuming that further offense on their part is not really a realistic proposition as long as you play a careful tactical game, the only real option they have is to reinforce their line; bringing in two armies into Sil and War would allow them a perfect defensive line, and even one army would allow them more leeway in eg. active defense. Do they have builds in reserve? Are they likely to gain more builds in Germany soon? How long, exactly, it takes for you to replace that fleet in Rumania and then to seize Galicia? These sorts of questions will come to matter, but only if the opposition is playing on a level where they even perceive the nature of the battlelines and what they're doing. If the opposition is more or less just playing a tactical game, it's entirely possible that you don't need to worry about reinforcements before it's already too late for the northern alliance in Russia: they might not realize that it's a losing position before you seize Galicia, at which point it's going to be just a couple of turns before you're in Warsaw.<br/><br/>Were I playing a southern Power here, my recommended immediate moves would probably be something like Sev-Rum, Rum-Bul, Arm-Sev, Tyr-Pie, Tri-Tyr, Vie-Boh, Ank-Bla, Bul-Aeg, Con H, with Budapest supporting whatever seems likeliest to suffer interference. The enemy could hassle those moves a bit, but provided that they're playing with a defensive mindset, these moves could swing the tactical initiative clearly onto the southern side in one swoop. The French army would probably have to protect Vienna in the fall anyway, and the Austrian fleet would probably have to hold in Bulgaria as well, but those details could be fixed next year. The important thing would be to get the show in Russia on the road before the northerners figure out that they have a too small army group in the area. Bonus points if Bohemia ends up remaining in southern hands after the year's maneuvers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316957/#Comment_316957" name="Item_147" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-17T13:10:03+00:00" title="March 17, 2011  1:10PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, yes, I see what you mean. I'm a little less optimistic about it, due to two factors: first, I will be *very* surprised not to see Italy go for Serbia again (or to attack France in Vienna, Spain, or Tunis). I can only really influence Serbia at this moment, so right now my plan is to get there first. Second, the Northerners certainly see themselves as the aggressors in the East (they've been making progress in that area for the last ten years of gameplay or so, and it'll take them a while to shift their perspective on things). They'll definitely be, e.g., making a supported attack on Sev next Spring, which the kind of switcheroo you're suggesting difficult to pull off. <br/><br/>I may able to talk them out of attack NAf, however.

It's entirely possible that there are no viable routes to victory/draw available if and when a necessary quorum of players are playing against you. Italy and Turkey are probably the two Powers on this map for whom it makes some degree of sense to debase the southern defense and cause a massive northern victory - either might think with some justification that they can manipulate the board into a three-way draw with the northerners once the other has been destroyed. I personally wouldn't go for it partly because I wouldn't trust England and Germany to play rationally and partly because doing so would lose my own soloing chances for no good reason, but one can of course draw different conclusions from the board. And definitely, if the other is going for it, then you'll need to do it harder and faster and more decisively; Turkey is certainly in a position to do so in the corner.<br/><br/>One thing you might try with Italy is outright threatening him with the consequences of his actions: if he doesn't restrain himself now that the north is already in control of about half of the board, then to hell with him, and Turkey'll play for the second best thing, which would here be crippling Italy while maintaining his own position, thus allowing Turkey to remain on the board to the end, probably gaining you a prestigious three-way draw. After all, if you can't hope to beat back the northerners, then it seems to me that your advantage is in ensuring that England and Germany become equally powerful (to reduce the likelyhood of soloing), both get plenty of troops into Austria (so that the forces against Turkey will be split in the end) and that they'll overrun Italy quickly (to bring to the game to an end-state quickly). It depends on the player how this sort of direct communication works, though - I've played with people who think that I'm lying out of desperation or strutting for no reason when I declare intent of future hostility in this way, so it doesn't work all the time. If the player cares about their own position on the board, though, and they can follow the logic of why you'd play the way you claim, then this sort of thing might have weight in their thinking. It's certainly true that if Italy and Turkey both go into wrecking mode, Italy with its central position is much more likely to become surrounded and die long before the northerners manage to breach Turkey.<br/><br/>Basically, what I'm saying is that I don't really see this position as so beneficent that the south can afford internal strife. Either Italy plays on the team or you'll be better off selling everybody (Italy included) down the river to set up your own position in the draw. I'd think that it's a priority for Italy in its exposed central position to keep Turkey happy, but what do I know.<br/><br/>As for the psychological aspects of the eastern front, you'll need to make the Anglo-Germans change their thinking: if you know that they're thinking aggressively, you need to foil their likely attacks and counter-attack in ways that'll give them a bloody nose. You're in no immediate danger here, so just support the line in place until you get a fleet to Bla, then use this increased strength to do the Rum swap, then start slowly grinding for position. In the final calculation what the Anglo-Germans think about the eastern front will not change the fact that you're the party with the material advantage, it just means that you need to make the approach a bit more carefully while waiting for them to realize the truth as well. If all goes well, you might even be able to cause a tactical upset when they overreach later by attacking when defense would have been warranted. As an arbitrary example, you might consider outright attacking Galicia from Vienna this turn if you think that they might assault Sevastopol. Depends on how good a feel you think you have on their tactics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316971/#Comment_316971" name="Item_149" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-17T14:32:34+00:00" title="March 17, 2011  2:32PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Total agreement here!

I also sent Germany a very specific plan of attack (Germany had the possibility of capturing four English SCs in one move). Anything I could do to get everyone into action against England and Germany, and those two to break alliance and move against each other.<br/><br/>1917<br/><br/>My impression had been that people were beginning to suspect me as the "anonymous advisor", and listening less and less to his advice. However, in this case the letters worked even better than I had expected... <br/><br/>I showed up at the game with several players (especially Germany) making a point of saying that they had not had a chance to read the e-mails. I was a little dejected: I spent quite a bit of time putting those together, after all.<br/><br/>In the Spring, Italy failed to support France (as I had suggested) and England and Germany advanced South, taking Spain. As Turkey, I helped France and Austria hold their position while slowly advancing mine own (as you will see from the map).<br/><br/>In the Fall, however, all shit went loose. Germany put into action almost exactly the plan I had sent him, striking against England everywhere! However, he was smarter than I expected: he had also made plans with Italy to move on everyone and destroy France. So, Germany supported Italy into Spain (where England had just invaded), and Italy supported Germany into Vienna. Italy simultaneously invaded Tunis, nearly killing France. (France only survived because an Austrian attack succeeded unexpectedly, giving the army in Vienna a place to retreat: that's how France ends up in Budapest.)<br/><br/>Meanwhile, however, England was also affected by my letters and simultaneously went into action against Germany! Both allies since 16 years of gameplay, and here they turn on each other simultaneously!<br/><br/>There were many angry looks around the table, but not much progress by anyone, since they both stabbed at the same time. Italy and Germany both built, however, and France was almost dead.<br/><br/>1918<br/><br/>The following year, England continues to attack Germany, while Italy and Germany keep working together but are outmaneuvered and lose ground (Spain, Kiel, Holland). <br/><br/>(It was a very odd game: England and Austria-Hungary could not make it, so the English player allowed the old Russian player to make her moves, and Austria handed control of his units to France. The Russian player played true to form, being extremely aggressive, if a little sloppy, and the French player did her usual strategic nonsense: first she supported me into Serbia (I promised to protect her from Germany and Italy, who were obviously keen to finish the job they'd started), and then in the Fall Italy somehow convinced her that she should *attack* Serbia, with Italian support. I wasn't prepared for that attack mentally (why piss off your only ally?), but I did choose a moveset which held off the attack. If that's not enough to convince you France isn't easy to read, at the same time that she used Italy and Germany to attack me, she moves the other Austrian unit North to grab Berlin, which goes through unopposed.)<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Italy attempts to attack me. I let the Ionian hold in preparation, and when attacked, retreated into the Tyrrhenian. Italy seemed to see sense in what I was saying and disbanded Ionian at the end of that year: not sure what this means for our future relations.<br/><br/>Here's Fall 1918:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://ihousenews.pbworks.com/f/Fall1918.gif"/><br/> <br/>My current tack is to convince everyone to work against England, who is close to victory, and to do everything I can to get Italy to move towards the Atlantic before England comes into the Mediterranean. We'll see what happens this time... will people lie about "not having read" my letters again? Do they still suspect me? Not sure.<br/><br/>Notes: Holland is English, Moscow is German, Sweden is German.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13406/help-with-diplomacy-needed-strategy/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13406/help-with-diplomacy-needed-strategy">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13406/help-with-diplomacy-needed-strategy/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13406/help-with-diplomacy-needed-strategy/p3">3</a><a class=" p-4 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13406/help-with-diplomacy-needed-strategy/p4" rel="next">4</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13406/help-with-diplomacy-needed-strategy/p4" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F13406%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F13406%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Help with Diplomacy Needed.

Putting a few fleets of your own into rear positions in the anti-English line in the Med is a good start in this regard. The same principle goes for Germany on the continent. Both should be made aware of the English threat, especially Germany - his lines are currently awfully weak.<br/><br/>France and Austria are irrelevant at this point and actively harmful if they can't be trusted to cooperate, so you're probably best off by talking them into attacking out of their positions while you move yourself into those same positions. Specifically, first dislodge France with Austrian help, then do the same to the Austrian, leaving you, Italy, Germany and England to resolve the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318054/#Comment_318054" name="Item_152" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-29T09:30:40+00:00" title="March 29, 2011  9:30AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Eero.

My main objective now will be to build another army by claiming Rumania so I can secure the Balkans, and making sure as much as I can that the Alliance is taking shape against England.<br/><br/>I hope to push into the Mid-Atlantic (Western Med supports Portugal into MAO, Gulf of Lyons cuts support from Spain), and organize a disband of Moscow in the Spring.<br/><br/>I feel pretty confident that Turkey is now a certain member of any possible draw: the challenge appears to be preventing an English victory. I'll try to convince England to keep that fleet in the North Sea to leave the MAO open for one or two fleets to slip through.<br/><br/>My questions:<br/><br/>As England, what are your most likely routes to a solo victory?

What are the most realistic avenues of gain?<br/><br/>Right now, I'm moving slowly, just trying to encourage everyone to move away from my borders while advancing my units into inconspicuous gains (like Rumania this turn: no one will object, neither will it cause anyone to disband, so I hope it goes almost unnoticed).<br/><br/>I'm mainly trying to keep everyone focused on the English threat, of course.<br/><br/>I'd love to hear your thoughts on those two questions. <br/><br/>(Also: If Italy asks me to send me fleets into the Atlantic instead of theirs, should I go for it?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Piers" title="Piers"><img alt="Piers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Piers">Piers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318454/#Comment_318454" name="Item_156" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-02T09:28:50+00:00" title="April  2, 2011  9:28AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a good position for you. England is over-stretched and unbalanced\u2014too much in the east, not enough in the west.  But it is a crucial year, because if England can just stabilize the situation in the Atlantic, moving the fleet from the North Sea into the Channel to support and then building fleets with gains in Sweden and Holland, it\u2019ll be pretty close to a stalemate position, and a dangerous one that can make gains when everyone else turns on each other.<br/><br/>The real crux here is MAO and Portugal: if either side has fleets in both of these and one more in support (plus no fleets behind the lines), then MAO is proof against any attack. You need to be very careful that this doesn\u2019t happen no matter what.<br/><br/>So, think about attacking Portugal to MAO with support, but notice that if England moves Spain-&gt;Portugal you are danger of getting locked out, and keep in mind that you will need to attack back into Portugal from MAO on the next turn, to prevent England capturing MAO and Portugal. Ideally you\u2019ll bounce, be forced to retreat to, say, Irish Sea or Brest, at the same time as West Med and GoL combine to take Spain. This should lead to a back and forth over the two which you will eventually win. <br/><br/>Alternatively, you could go for a combined assault on Marseille (Munich cuts Burgunday, F GoL S A Piedmont; Portugal or West Med attack Spain with support from the other--but this risks losing both MAO and Portugal if England makes the wrong moves. You will need to think through your options here.<br/><br/>Either way, you need a fleet in NAf by the end of the year. You\u2019ll have to send Ion through Tunis to do this. Tell Italy what you are doing, point out you could just take it from him anyway, and use Tyr to support, just in case. (At which point you will be surrounding Tunis and can take it any time you want.)<br/><br/>As for whether you should go into the Atlantic if Italy asks, that is a definite yes! You will gain at least one center and will be building a fleet, so home security shouldn\u2019t be a worry.  More importantly, if you are to stand any chance of getting a solo victory, troops on the other side of the stalemate line will be absolutely vital.  This is potentially a huge advantage for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318567/#Comment_318567" name="Item_157" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-03T12:52:02+00:00" title="April  3, 2011 12:52PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Piers.

The position is not viable for soloing, but if a considerable compromise with somebody or other could break the Alliance, then I could double back into position and finish the soloing in the confusion. This is especially true with volatile beginner players.<br/><br/>My first move would be to offer Italy some substantial incentives: Spain and then support for Italian advance into Munich. I'd try to get into NAf in the deal, either by misdirection or straight out as a security claim in trade for giving up Spain. I'd also instruct Italy to keep his cards close until the attack into Germany, so as to keep it a surprise. If and when this ploy succeeded I could retake Spain at leisure while Turkey would hopefully turn on Italy for messing with Germany at a critical juncture.<br/><br/>For Turkey the key to soloing would be in using a "soft center" formation: shift your balance towards the Atlantic (and the Nordic area if possible) without taking excessive control over the central continental area. This will help you keep from seeming like a threat while you improve your position: later when you spring to action you'll take the central positions without difficulty from the fractured and fractitious Powers fighting over the area, and your strong grip on the Atlantic area enables you to pressure Italy from both sides. Make full use of your sacrifice in not taking control of the central areas (Austrian SCs are mostly what I'm talking about) by encouraging Italy and Germany to fight over the area; don't overdo it and allow England to prosper, but try to keep those two suspicious of each other and focused on the idea of fighting the other for the Austrian SCs. (In practice you might start by allotting one SC from the area to Germany as a fief.) Also encourage Italian fleets to move to the Atlantic. Once you control Iberia, Balkans and Russia (barring StP) you'll be at 12 SCs, at which point you'll be in position to start your final thrust at soloing by attacking Italy from both east and west while also flanking Austria from both Russia and the Balkans. England can't interfere because your flanks in Russia and Iberia are very defensible against the west, and Germany and Italy will find it difficult to join forces to stop you in Austria (they can't stop you in Italy) because you've been fostering resentment between the two. The others likely won't react to your threat too early in this arrangement because the areas I designate as your targets are not particularly ear-marked to anybody else now that France and Russia are both goners.<br/><br/>Regarding fleets in the Atlantic area, you will benefit from having either your fleets or Italian fleets there, but I would consider the Italian a better option in the long term due to how it inflames the Anglo-Italian relationship. Just make it clear to Italy that whoever puts their fleets there has the right of conquest as well. If you end up moving more than one fleet to the Atlantic zone, you should take both Iberian SCs and not move any further (think up excuses if you must); if Italy accedes to advancing, encourage him to move to NAO and in general to mess up the English home defense zones. Your goal here is to take firm control of Iberia yourself in preparation for attacking Italy while making disengagement as impossible as possible for England and Italy.

However, if Turkey makes a decisive move, England might get reneved when the others turn against Turkey. I would prefer having more of a margin of error before making my decisive move, were I the Turk; that's what it comes down to here, how long you can string everybody along before it becomes obvious to the clever ones that you're on the brink of a solo attempt.<br/><br/>I note that Germany is not doing well at all here, he only has four SCs. You need to either relegate him to the dustbin of strategy with the Austrian and French remains (although there are so many of these minuscule hangers-on left that together they almost matter), or you need to work proactively to restore him. Depends on the diplomacy, but the ideal play would be to somehow prop up Germany, get him into full control of his homeland and perhaps even get him a few fleets. The wet dream scenario would be Germany pushing towards Paris while two German fleets and the StP army contest the Nordic area. This would make an ideal background for an Italian stab on Germany, immediately followed by a Turkish stab of Italy and a wild rush at a solo.<br/><br/>The above sort of groundwork takes time that you might not have, but you also can't pull the trigger immediately: England is still too strong, and you don't have a good enough handle on Iberia; you need to get into a situation where England is too entangled with Germany and Italy to threaten a solo when you try for it yourself, which basically means that you can't start it with Italy in position to throw the game to England. Then again, waiting too long is not good either, as psychologically these situations almost always work out to a stab of some sort from your allies if you don't move first; you need to act before Italy realizes that you have a shot at a solo, basically.<br/><br/>In practical terms, it would be ideal if you could get Warsaw for either yourself or Germany. Get Germany to Berlin and Kiel if you can, he's being weak for no good reason here. Get more feet on the ground in Russia, you want to have three armies there when you pull the trigger, and they'll help you in taking Warsaw, too. That fleet in Sev can go back to Bla to move troops, and later it needs to go south to join the anti-Italian moves when the time comes. Keeping armies in Serbia and Rumania is good, but as discussed earlier, I wouldn't myself move to Austria unless it starts lacking in attraction for the other Powers - you want them to fight over a piece of ground that you can take trivially with your Russian forces when the time comes, as that keeps them from uniting against you. Encourage Germany and Italy both to maintain their claims to Austria, and use Budapest as a negotiation token to mislead folks: offer to support either Germany or Italy or perhaps both there, whatever it takes to make them think that you're on their side. (Giving Budapest to Italy has other problems, so I don't really recommend it for realz - if only Germany had an army in the area, it'd be so much easier.)<br/><br/>Encourage Italy to overreach on the Atlantic any way you can. For instance, MAO-NAO would be a brilliant offensive move here. Your own fleets are in nice positions, don't move to the Atlantic yourself before you get new fleet on the scene; remember that your Atlantic goal is taking Iberia and nothing else (except perhaps Marseilles if the opportunity comes). Try to get the Italian into Marseilles, get him into thinking in terms of conquering France by building armies. If you can start your last war with Italy in a situation where every Italian fleet is on the Atlantic and he only has armies while you can attack him from both east and west, that'll be so perfect it's insane.<br/><br/>If Germany proves non-viable, you need to move for your own solo very fast, but you probably can't attack Italy to do it then. The problem is that with Germany gone or reduced into scraps the game has basically moved into a three-way end-game, and those are very stable when played correctly: you are hardly in position to fight both England and Italy simultaneously, and you're obligated to defend Italy against England to prevent him from soloing. For this reason you need to get lots of armies into Russia, and when you decide that Germany can't be fed into a fourth Power, you go into a solo rush where you claim Austria, Russia and Germany with Italian alliance, and then hopefully crawl over the finish line by stabbing the naive Italian for the last few SCs. This is far inferior as a plan compared to the "take Iberia, stab Italy while Germany fights England" thing, but it's the best you can get in a couple of turns, and the only one you can try if Germany folds. The plan rests on the premise that you can avoid having Italy turn on you by continuing to play like nothing has happened even as you make your solo push against England and Germany; if that goes on long enough without Italy realizing (due to inexperience) how close you are to your goal, you have a chance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319200/#Comment_319200" name="Item_163" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-06T15:59:53+00:00" title="April  6, 2011  3:59PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How can Germany survive?

As things stand, England is paying nothing for defending against you, so he just has to wait for any one of you other Powers to have a brainfart so he can go back into the offensive. The way to make England actually feel the pressure and take losses is to get a raider fleet into NAO, from whence it can tie down forces in defending English home SCs, as well as help Germany crack the Nordic position. MAO-NAO-Nwg is just two moves, after which an attack on Norway becomes viable, assuming Germany still has that fleet at that point.<br/><br/>You should make Italy feel like propping up Germany is your best chance for reining in England. And propping up Germany is best and most naturally done by causing the Nordic area to slide under German control; it's a solid set of SCs and relatively easy to hold once conquered, and perhaps most importantly, England cannot be considered an end-game Power without control of the area - if you could achieve this somewhat outlandish objective, you'd have gone a long ways towards paralyzing the west.<br/><br/>As for Germany, the position has been made tactically very difficult by positioning forces stupidly. Whoever had the brilliant idea of vacating Berlin so England could take and hold Kiel was not doing you any favours. As I see it, tactically the best hope for Germany is to try Mun-Ber, Ruh-Mun and hope that England plays Kie H; after that he can try to take back Kiel, maybe. (If you know that England's playing Kie-Ber, then Ruh-Kie is of course the answer.) Nothing more can be done without getting that fleet to NAO; the best use for the German fleet and army in StP is probably in fighting against the substantial English forces in the Nordic area. StP-Fin with the fleet in support would be my own move for Germany here, even as it's likely that England'll foil it by defending in place.<br/><br/>The fundamental difficulty in helping Germany is that eastern allies cannot support Germany in fighting against a western opponent. For this reason the best way to help Germany is to fuck up the English position to such a degree that he cannot help but lessen his pressure on Germany. For this reason, take Marseilles with an army, move to NAO and thus make enough breathing room for Germany to at least gain local parity instead of being on the brink of destruction like he is now. Were I playing England here myself, I'd be thinking in terms of getting armies to Kie-Ruh-Bur and overrunning Germany completely. That's what you need to stop.<br/><br/>As for Warsaw, it's a bit annoying that there's no German army nearby to help out. Probably your best bet is to support France in there and move your own army into Ukraine to replace the Frenchman. Then in the fall claim Warsaw yourself; maybe nobody else will find this too aggravating, as the only suffering party will be France, who has not been relevant for a long time. My main concern here is getting more of your forces into Russia, really. Once you have something in Warsaw you can start thinking of moving to support Germany into Berlin or something like that, too. The main goal is to get the other players used to thinking that Russia south of StP is exclusively Turkish territory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319296/#Comment_319296" name="Item_165" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-07T03:56:23+00:00" title="April  7, 2011  3:56AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, what big thread.<br/><br/>In diplomacy based games, my usual tactic is 'help me to help you'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319340/#Comment_319340" name="Item_166" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-07T09:00:02+00:00" title="April  7, 2011  9:00AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Eero.<br/><br/>Yes, this year would have gone exceptionally well, until Austria screwed it all up by moving out of Warsaw, which gave it to England (instead of disbanding the English army), AND then disbanding his unit in Berlin.<br/><br/>I'm also considering forcing MAO myself in the Fall, hopefully giving the fleet in the MAO a "free move" via retreat.

I'd be concerned that the Italian would retreat to Portugal or some such out of spite, though.<br/><br/>Perhaps what you should do is to talk about going to NAO with the Italians, and if they don't, then talk to them about you forcing the issue in the fall. Explain that it's a good idea for you to attack and them to retreat because it'll make it impossible for the Englishman to prevent the assault from getting through; no matter if England covers Brest or NAO or whatnot, there'll be a place to slip in on retreat. In this way a retreat-attack would be even more effective than a normal attack. The real benefit from your viewpoint, however, would be the gain of another talking point with Italy: by approaching the same idea (an Italian raider) from multiple directions over a longer time-frame you communicate serious commitment to the notion, which should at some point convince the Italian, too.<br/><br/>Of course it would be ideal if you didn't have to go to MAO yourself, but if you do have to do it to convince the Italian to detach a raider, then it's surely worthwhile. You can use your MAO fleet as a stationary support for Italian efforts, perhaps take Brest for a year at some point, come back and be in position to attack Iberia effectively when the moment comes to stab Italy.<br/><br/>The optimum situation would, however, be if you could get the Italian to commit more armies to the area: an army into Marseilles, then another into Spain as the fleet goes to Portugal or MAO. Your absolute dream scenario would be if you could get both Italian fleets to commit against England on the Atlantic while he defends his positions in the Western Mediterranean area with two armies in Spain and Marseilles. That'd leave him relatively weak against your eventual stab.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319361/#Comment_319361" name="Item_168" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-07T09:52:20+00:00" title="April  7, 2011  9:52AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 7, 2011 9:53AM by Paul_T.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds good, Eero.<br/><br/>Marseilles is already on the "to do list", and has been for a while.

Could building, say, a couple of fleets back home totally screw up my future prospects?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319369/#Comment_319369" name="Item_169" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-07T10:15:42+00:00" title="April  7, 2011 10:15AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, one Italian fleet probably wouldn't be that bad for you, but two could be a problem of sorts. The main issue with fleets is that if Italy has them in proper positions (at sea, in position to take Tunis, in position to threaten Greece), he has much more flexibility in defense than he would have with armies only. If the timing works out so that the Italian fleets are in harbour when you occupy TyS and Ion, then it doesn't really matter - could even be slightly better than an equal number of armies.<br/><br/>The main concept that you need to keep an eye on when you consider Italy as a victim is overreaching, a very common problem with less skilled players: you want to attract Italy into a position where his commitments (the positions he needs to occupy to maintain his borders and policies) form a great majority of his available forces. This happy situation (happy for you, that is) reduces the flexibility of the Italian forces and forces Italy to make compromises on where and what to defend when you suddenly double his commitments by turning so far peaceful flanks into warzones.<br/><br/>What commitments look like in practice varies, but as I've mentioned, my favourites for Italy here are some Austrian possessions, a stab at Germany and possessions on the wrong side of Gibraltar, in English territory. All of these are matters that require him to commit forces outside his homeland and to build units that are not ideal for waging war with you. One of the big secrets of Diplomacy is that any units that are fortified in enemy territory, busy holding onto SCs, are illusionary force: they cannot be moved without losing the SCs that are supporting them. You want as much as possible of the Italian force to consist of these types of possessions and commitments. The ideal moment to stab is when Italy has moved too many units out of immediate defensive range for some ambitious foreign adventure, as recalling those forces is both slow and hazardous, as the trouble might follow them home.<br/><br/>Getting Italy to Marseilles and even further north into Burgundy and Gascony is so very useful for you because every army so occupied represents a committed unit that is not available for using against you. Your own forces, in comparison, should all be in striking distance of Italy. Meanwhile England should ideally be so weakened when your strike comes that while he can put pressure on the Italian position, he cannot truly endanger your plan. You might not get everything to settle down just perfectly in this regard, but that's the ideal goal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319370/#Comment_319370" name="Item_170" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-07T10:19:22+00:00" title="April  7, 2011 10:19AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fantastic, thanks, Eero.<br/><br/>This is one element of Diplomacy play I'd picked up from some of your other comments, and a valuable one.<br/><br/>In this game in particular, it led to Turkish expansion when France was stabbed by England: even though the stab only took two Centres, the only way France could defend was to flee all her other far-flung conquests, which quickly fell to Italy and myself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320282/#Comment_320282" name="Item_171" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-13T08:15:55+00:00" title="April 13, 2011  8:15AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 13, 2011 8:17AM by Paul_T.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ooh, boy! Well, things get interesting in 1921.<br/><br/>Would love to hear your thoughts: this is where advising is most likely going to be most interesting, as well, since many different plans of action are possible, and the future is fairly uncertain.<br/><br/>As you can see from Fall 1920, Turkey is moving ahead, and I continued that in 1921, taking Eero's advice to move some strength into position in Russia.<br/><br/>However, Germany is under heavy attack from England. I sent out some "propaganda" e-mails to all the other nations, telling them that Germany's survival depends on their support, and that if they fail to hold up Germany, most likely the game will be lost to the English.<br/><br/>This time, it didn't work at all. None of the "allies" followed those directions. The only part of the map where some semblance of the "Germany defensive plan" took hold was around the Mid-Atlantic, which is now semi-solidly in "allied" hands. However, England has now moved in and no further progress is likely: it'll take everything just to hold in place, and most likely the Mid-Atlantic will be soon lost.<br/><br/>Worse yet, Austria did a dirty deed: he not only let England into Warsaw and then into Silesia, but he snuck into Vienna.

A few players (like Austria) may be acting against the suggestions of the "anonymous advisor" purely out of spite (his admission when I asked why he would let England into Warsaw and then Silesia).<br/><br/>Italy seems to be gearing up into anti-Turkey mode (e.g. fleet build in Naples).<br/><br/>Austria is trying to survive: this Fall, it seems he told Italy he would move to Budapest, giving them Vienna, but then held in place, causing all that movement to bounce. Once again, he claims this was "an error". I'm not convinced, as you can probably tell. Still, Italy ordered support for Vienna to Budapest, and Tyrolia to Vienna. So Italy is definitely eyeing the Balkans now.<br/><br/>Questions:<br/><br/>Is it time for Turkey to try for the solo?<br/><br/>I feel the situation is not quite ripe (one more army build, and getting that fleet out into the Mediterranean would be ideal), but waiting even longer may be dangerous: there is a possibility of Austria and Italy working against Turkey, and that might lead very quickly to an English victory.<br/><br/>In addition, it will be difficult for me to take Warsaw without giving England St. Petersburg, which would most likely retreat back into Moscow and would be another loss for me and another gain for England.<br/><br/><br/>How is England's position? They will likely be gaining territory this turn, esp. with Belgium and Munich, as well as the Mid-Atlantic. Is there a threat of an English solo taking place faster than Turkey's if war breaks out now?<br/><br/><br/>The best offensive options I'm seeing for Turkey would involve bargaining with England. I could offer them St. Petersburg in exchange for helping me in Iberia, say: get them to attack Marseilles to cut support, use Mid-Atlantic and Gulf of Lyons to take Portugal and Spain, and hopefully Naples or Venice if Italy tries to slip out with that fleet (I could move to Naples or Apulia from the Ionian, for example).<br/><br/>It's not exactly a terribly effective stab, however.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, I'm thinking something like Gal -&gt; Boh, Ukr -&gt; Gal, Sev -&gt; Rum, to get me quickly into position for Budapest and Warsaw.<br/><br/>It's a tough pickle; I'd really like to wait a little longer, but I'm unsure how much risk is involved.<br/><br/>Interesting dilemmas to ponder, however!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320321/#Comment_320321" name="Item_173" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-13T11:03:02+00:00" title="April 13, 2011 11:03AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is pretty interesting, although also frustrating - I hate it when underdog players break discipline. (Not that they should play to my advantage, you understand, but it's annoying when they don't respect the game and the other players by giving it their best. A gratification-driven generation we have here, no sense of duty at all.)<br/><br/>England is at effective 11 SCs (assuming Belgium lost), while Turkey is at 10 and Italy at six. The situation is very close to an effective three-way dynamic where the only thing keeping Italy from attacking you is the fact that you're cooperating against England; turn against Italy and it'll be very easy for Italy to combine forces with England. Meanwhile the minority players are pretty inexperienced and unreliable, so you don't have much room for fancy plans that use all resources; somebody will probably fuck up just like they've been doing, which is why any plan needs to build in plenty of extra room for error. A quite difficult position for doing anything.<br/><br/>The alliance really failed to make any progress anywhere since the last map; not only has England completed a defensive line on the Atlantic, but the German situation in StP is also in control from the English viewpoint. England can't win unless Turkey and Italy have a falling-out. Tactically you have solid claim to 13 SCs in the center, while Italy will cause trouble over Trieste and his home SCs; another 1-2 SC are there for the taking in Iberia, but you couldn't hold them indefinitely without crushing Italy, so you might have to ensure that Italy holds them for you against England instead.<br/><br/>It occurs to me that the best way to make breathing room for yourself might be a two-way alliance with England. This is pure bullshit as regards the game's strategic logic, but the player might go for it anyway if you tell them that now it's time to set aside past disputes and seek serious alliance for the end-game. If England is feeling besieged simply being nice and plotting with him against everybody else might sway him into irrational trust. You could set this up by offering and executing some minor, ultimately meaningless cooperative moves that bring you <i>both</i> closer to soloing. Then you'll just need to ensure that the brunt of the remaining resistance on the board is directed against England while your own forces finish mopping up the easy areas and then stab England for the solo at the last moment.<br/><br/>Barring that, you might have to play some long-term tactical plays to improve your position and push back England. I'll list some things you might try to achieve over the next three years that might, if tactically successful, allow you to drag the game forwards at a trench warfare pace.<ul><li>Kill off the Austrian by supporting Italy into Vienna on the spring move while going to Budapest yourself to keep Austria at bay. Arrange with France to leave Budapest on the fall move while you move into Warsaw yourself; France doesn't need two SCs in the east, but they do need help getting west - promise to help them back into their homeland through Munich with Italian aid as long as they play as you tell them to. Get Italy to claim Trieste and Vienna and then to demilitarize Vienna in exchange for you to keep out of Budapest. The point is to set up a divided Austria that'll be easy for you to take when the time comes, while you take full responsibility for Russia and get that French army to do something useful. Getting rid of the Austrian player is also important, you can't afford a crazy dictator who can build next to your lands.</li><li>Get massive forces to Germany by talking Italy into making some serious moves. If necessary, tell Italy that your only option is to march through Austria and northern Italy if they can't get up off their ass and start fighting England for real. You need a second army in Piedmont to threaten progress into France and at least the one French army, one of yours and two Italian armies in the Tyr-Pru corridor immediately if you're to break England; the only position where that can be done anymore is in the middle, the Atlantic front is done thanks to Italy's mismanagement of the earlier position. Once you get those armies, use them to support the German remnants, march the French army west (no hurry, that army can be supported off Budapest indefinitely) and to commit Italian forces against England; don't take frontal positions in Germany yourself unless there are no choices or England is genuinely driven off; as long as England is committed to Germany, you want Italy to be the one who contests the area, not yourself.</li><li>I was going to say that an Italian army needs to be convoyed asapt to Marseilles, but those positions are truly fuxxored - Italy can't threaten to seriously take Gascony without a second army for Marseilles. And fleet builds of all things, yet... Well, the best thing to do in the west is still Mar-Gas, Gas-MAO and MAO-NAf, I think. As you can't really break to the Atlantic anymore, your priority should be to leave the front positions and Iberia for Italy to defend while your own fleets remain in support positions where they ensure that England can't progress, either, and are able to turn against Italian home SCs quicky. Make sure Italy understands that you have too many fleets due to Italy failing to break through earlier, but that you can't do anything about that and the best thing to do is to pile the fleets in there and wait for armies to make room for a new break-through. If you by some miracle get an Italian army into Gascony (an eggrecious error on the part of England to allow that) the situation will have much more potential due to England's relative lack of armies to block with. Still, this front probably won't do anything significant before you get an army into Munich and can start hoping for an attack on Burgundy to go through.</li></ul>\nRegarding the situation in Gascony, technically England's best play is to bounce Bur and Bre in Gascony while cutting the Atlantic to ensure that you conquer neither Gascony, Burgundy nor Brest. The real player might instead play eg. Bur-Gas with no bounce, which would theoretically allow you to play Mar-Bur while allowing the army into Gascony, thus enabling Italy to slip behind the enemy lines. I'm not optimistic - even if England should make this particular mistake, Italy probably wouldn't follow through. Still, that's something to ponder - whether to try for Gascony or Burgundy with the army. Nothing much else to do in that area, except ensuring the maximal entanglement of Italy and England.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320349/#Comment_320349" name="Item_174" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-13T13:09:55+00:00" title="April 13, 2011  1:09PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting, Eero. I'm with you on all those points: problem is, I've been harping on getting a second Italian army to support Marseilles (and move into France) and on getting Italy into Bohemia and Tyrolia for support of Munich for the last three years. They've never so much as considered it: I'm fairly sure they consider it a "Turkish ploy". While it <i>is</i>, in a sense, it's also legitimately the only way (at least in my mind) to keep England from marching all over Germany.<br/><br/>I'm curious about your thoughts on alliance with England. The same thought has crossed my mind, since any Italian stab, as you point out, does not seem all that useful *without* English aid.<br/><br/>How would you go about such an alliance?<br/><br/>It still seems to me that England currently has more room for growth than Turkey does: St.P, as you point out, Marseilles and Iberia if Italy and I get into a fight, and also all of Germany.<br/><br/>How might such an alliance keep an even keel? I think England may be receptive: the English player is a relatively peaceful one, and does indeed feel "beset on all sides".<br/><br/>Is there some way to combine these two goals, to hold England back but simultaneously work with her together?<br/><br/>I suspect that Italy may be talked into continuing the alliance if they feel extremely safe about the Balkan area: for some reason my fleet presence around Italy doesn't seem to worry them much, but moving out of Trieste scares them to death.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320367/#Comment_320367" name="Item_175" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-13T14:02:59+00:00" title="April 13, 2011  2:02PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, objectively Italy's best play of the moment would be to demonstrate a fuller consciousness and declare the game a three-way draw, with intent to enforce against either England or Turkey as necessary. That'd save Italy and stop either of you from seizing a solo, so the only option would be to eliminate the minor Powers (trivial at this point, except maybe for some negotiation regarding who takes what from Germany) and take the draw. This would require Italy to actually understand the game's goals, though, which doesn't seem to be the case. Still, difficult to blame them for not playing to your advantage, even if that means that you'll need to play desperation moves.<br/><br/>Regarding England, the thing to do is to frame an alternate reality in your head and start arguing, discussing and existing in that context. A false consciousness of the board, one where it makes perfect sense for you to get closer to England and win their trust. Not too easy, as that is obvious (although never as obvious to them as to you), but naturally, like you don't see anything strange with swapping allies at this point. Congratulate them for managing to stop Italy, tell of how you recommended to the idiot that they'd have to break through to NAO, but now that that's impossible you'll want to make the best of it and join up with the winning faction. Point out that the alternative is basically that you and Italy go into an extremely slow trench war to overpower England with your greater strength. Say whatever seems to make sense in the victim's framework.<br/><br/>If England seems receptive, provide tokens of your trust in as many steps as possible, to cram as much positive interaction as possible into the smallest possible time-frame, so that England feels after two turns that you've always been allied. Don't speak of your worries about England soloing anymore, forget the entire angle in your discussion; rather concentrate on the idea that you've helped England, England should help you - display suspicion that England might be plotting with Italy against you to encourage them to prove their loyalty. Give them gifts with no ultimate meaning or poisonous meaning while taking real advantages yourself.<br/><br/>StP you won't give to England - don't talk of it to begin with, and once you've established the alliance ask England to give the place to you on the basis that better you have than Germany. What would England do with the place anyway, we're all busy squishing up Italy here. Even better, convince England to shift excess forces away from StP, as you can handle the German forces there and England can use their own units better down south. Frame your spectacular and savage attack on Italy in alliance terms: you're doing service to England against your joint enemy; require payment in "kind", by having England help you progress even further. Prove your loyalty and gain credit by making conquests for yourself, and instead of helping England in reality, "help" by fighting your supposedly joint enemies. Meanwhile be careful to attack Italy in ways that leave Italian units capable of holding the line against England while being incapable of defending against you; a rational opponent will probably opt to hold the ground they can instead of relinquishing everything to England.<br/><br/>Regarding strategic goals in an English alliance, you'll want to withdraw your own fleets from the west before acting openly against Italy, so as to force Italy to hold Iberia with as many Italian forces as possible. Concentrate your fleets on the Italian peninsula and your armies on Austria, claim both savagely; you need to have your forces in the Tyr-Pru corridor as quickly as possible, ready to support Germany or even claim parts for yourself. Your English "alliance" should basically be you attacking as quickly as possible while England thinks that you're on their side, with each of your diplomatic moves intended to slow England down. Ideally you could help Italy fortify Iberia + Marseille against England simultaneously with conquering everything east of Switzerland for yourself; you have 17 SCs in that area, so if you can talk England into making an early gift of StP, get a German SC (possible, as England has only three armies; attract one to an off-position by offering him Vienna or something, then cleave in between with your own forces) or take Spain in a surprise move when both Italy and England expect you to support the place later on.<br/><br/>Roadmap: first year of allying you just talk about it and make plans with England - the more complex the better. You also move your forces to surround Italy, but without giving significant position to England. Second year, you attack everything; you've leaked the English offensive plan to Germany and Italy (without implicating a betrayal in English eyes), so they'll be ready to defend against a similar thrust by England. In second year you also start prepping England for a slow, ponderous assault on your mutual enemies, one that will leave him under-prepared in Germany; I suggest a strategic framework where "Germany does not matter" because "Germany is weak" and thus English armies should be concentrated on Bur and Gas to take Marseilles, after which you can convoy English forces quickly to northern Italy to "help crack the perfect Italian peninsular defense". Second year is also when England might donate StP to you "because you need it" against your many common enemies. Third year you'll encourage England to make these ultimately useless moves (threatening to cry if he gets "aggressive" by actually operating in Germany) while you consolidate your positions in the east. Fourth year is when you attack Germany and overcome Italy to such a degree that it becomes obvious to even England that you're soloing. After that everything depends on where everybody has their units, how bitter Italy is against England and how the tactics go down.<br/><br/>My play as Turkey here would probably be to push Italy to make a decision: either start playing like they're actually allied and this is the end-game, or fucking stab Turkey already! Nobody is served by dithering. Should Italy choose to really attack Turkey, that'd be an excellent opening for revealing a pre-negotiated alliance with a naive England. And if Italy does nothing (as is likelier), pretend that they stared you down and then stab them yourself anyway with English help. You will not be advantaged by a single turn of play here that does not move Italian forces decisively and effectively to fight against England. You need to have England feeling like the game is just beginning while Italy feels that this is the end-game (as it is), the moment of decisions and decisive actions, not a time for the usual chaotic selfishness that has dominated the game.<br/><br/>(That English plan is not a very good one, I should note - I'm just painting it because it might be your best shot at a solo at the moment. England could potentially play you instead to go for a solo, so if you want to play it safe you might declare that three-way draw yourself and end the game.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320412/#Comment_320412" name="Item_176" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-13T18:43:04+00:00" title="April 13, 2011  6:43PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, great stuff!<br/><br/>And fun to read, as well.<br/><br/>My situation with England is quite positive: I think England understands that I'm supporting against her basically because she is so dominant, and for most of the game we were working out moves together, when she was fighting against Russia and Austria. So, that's quite possibly a good way to go.<br/><br/>Italy's situation is different: there are two players, and both have a great deal of distrust for me in particular and everyone in general. They tend to play chaotic and selfish, as you say, and like to go against other people's advice even if it's a stupid idea. So threatening them is generally not a good idea, unless I want to provoke an irrational outburst.<br/><br/>I'm looking at the map and trying to see what working together with England might look like. Would I encourage her to move towards Marseilles and Iberia while I send my fleets to attack Italy itself? <br/><br/>Would I arrange "swap" tactics that look like cooperation but in the end benefit me more than England? Like, say, offering to "make room" for an army to move down into Europe from Scandinavia by saying: "Wouldn't it be nice if you could another army into the action? You could move Norway to Sweden and Sweden to Denmark, protecting yourself against that fleet in the Baltic, while we attack St. Petersburg together, putting him out of action (probably in Norway)." I would then take St. Petersburg with English support and finally offer support to help her crush the German army if it retreated to Norway. <br/><br/>Is that the sort of thing you're talking about?<br/><br/>Having the anonymous advisor is a nice benefit, since I can potentially provide two contrasting views of the game if necessary. Most of the players suspect it's me at this point, I think, but I think there are still enough doubts that the "general analyses" of the board are effective, even though individual advice tends to be ignored.<br/><br/>How can I retreat my fleets into an attack position on Italy without giving it away immediately? I can't imagine that Italy would fight all that hard for Spain and Portugal if he thought the peninsula itself was under attack... and I don't really see any plausible rationale for withdrawing those fleets while maintaining alliance with Italy (they're extremely resistant to the suggestion that they should send their fleets ahead against England, naturally).<br/><br/>And what kind of tactics can realistically hold back England's advance? It seems to me that if I retreated into an attack on Italy, her advance would be at least as quick as my own, or faster. I suppose I would need to encourage Italian advance into France and Germany as quickly as possible, as you said. Boy, that'll be like pulling teeth (remember, I've been trying to do just that for three years, with very little success, as you can see).<br/><br/>I wonder how England might be misdirected? Because right now all those English forces are perfectly poised to attack: there's really nothing to defend anywhere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320428/#Comment_320428" name="Item_177" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-13T20:17:07+00:00" title="April 13, 2011  8:17PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the situation is far from perfect, and if there always was a perfect solution to these conundrums then I'd lose much fewer games of Diplomacy than I do <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> You'll just have to take the best of the risky options and see it through, preferably without letting anybody else win so you can still get the three-way draw if your solo bid fails. (The guy who lets somebody else get a solo is just about the worst loser in Diplomacy - don't be that guy, take the draw instead if you have to.) It's always possible that your opponents play worse than they should - indeed, I'm pretty sure that Diplomacy couldn't be soloed at all if everybody achieved a pretty modest level of basic competence.<br/><br/>Regarding Iberia, the ideal way of encouraging Italy to defend there would be if you could get Italy to commit more armies in the area. This is also good in general against England in this situation. So if Italy refuses to put armies into the Tyr-Pru corridor, perhaps that might be offered as an alternative. An army in Spain, for example, doesn't really have any options except to hold the position when you attack Italy. Another thing to do is to present Italy with a fait accompli regarding their home SCs and explain them very carefully that their best play is to hang on in Iberia because Spain and Portugal are good for defense, and you'll support them in place against England - you'll do this because you want to prevent England from breaking into the Mediterranean. Italy would correctly understand that you're going for a solo, but this doesn't matter; they'll lose anyway once they've lost their home SCs (or so you can claim), so their best bid for getting into a draw is to influence England and you into splitting the board with Italy as the third player.<br/><br/>Your own fleets will basically get into position against Italy by staying where they are, roughly. As discussed before, perhaps get your MAO fleet back to NAf and try to get an Italian fleet to replace it. Your first surprise move will occupy Ion and TyS at least, and if you'll bring your last fleet from Bla to Aeg, you can put a fleet into Adr on the same move. Then on the fall move of the betrayal year you make a supported convoy on Naples (while interfering with Ven or Tri from Adr). After first year you'll have a beachhead in Naples, which usually means quick capitulation for Rome as well - and an army in peninsula supported by Adr fleet and an occupation of Austria will take Venice easily from two sides. You'll maybe be able to use one of your fleets exclusively in police duty in the Western Mediterranean; for example, you might tell Italy after the spring move that you're claiming the Italian peninsula and your fleet in... say NAf, will move NAf-Wes this turn with intent to support Italian holdings in Iberia against England. This will prevent an Italian fleet in eg. Spain or MAO from moving to Wes, thus slowing down Italian mobilization for home protection, and therefore perhaps convincing Italy that the war for the peninsula is futile.<br/><br/>As for England, attracting forces out of position is definitely the sort of  tactical shenanigan you'll want to do, but I'm uncertain whether taking units out of the Nordic front is good for you. If you could catch an English army in Prussia while Germany interferes from behind a year after your Italian attack begins or so (about when you're going to start fucking with the Englishman openly), then that'd be very good for you if you had your forces in Livonia and Warsaw at the time; you could essentially prevent the English three-army continental force from uniting effectively on the Ber-Mun axis (that's the only position England can hold, and the one they should fortify as quickly as they can; anything you can do to cause military adventurism that brings English forces too east or too west or too north or whatever is good) if one of his armies was in an over-extended frontal position in Prussia, another was in Burgundy and so on. I'd be inclined to say that if you could arrange for Swe to convoy to Prussia while you take StP with English aid, that'd be a trade favourable to you, at least to a degree.<br/><br/>Remember that when you start your final push for a solo, England won't be your first concern anymore: you are no longer trying to stop England from soloing, you're just trying to solo yourself. Your only concern regarding England will be whether you can take any SCs from them for yourself. England will find it impossible to solo without access to StP <i>and</i> Tunis; as long as your geopolitics keep England away from either (or ideally, both) of those your only concern about England will basically be whether you can race them to Munich or trick it away from them. The very best England can accomplish in the meanwhile will be to occupy the Mun-Ber position (basically guarantees that you won't solo, unless mistakes are made elsewhere) and to conquer Iberia and Marseille. Given time England could also put a substantial force into the western Med, but taking Tunis should be a pipe-dream with the number of fleets you're wielding there, especially as England would take several years to position those fleets. If you find yourself in a position where England has conquered the Iberian wing of Italy and seriously threatens your position on the Med, you should sue for peace and a three-way draw; I find it likely that something else will resolve first, though.<br/><br/>Incidentally: build armies if you can, you should have a bit more of them for the operations you'll have to pull. Five is almost enough for a decent front from Liv through to Albania, but you'll need something to occupy StP with if you can take it, and something to support your force and move into positions when you advance. And something to convoy to Italy, too, ideally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320771/#Comment_320771" name="Item_178" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-15T10:25:32+00:00" title="April 15, 2011 10:25AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lots of interesting advice, Eero, though much of contradictory (as you're thinking through many different ideas at once).<br/><br/>The next session may very well play at as a live "marathon" session of three or four years. This will interesting, but also very tricky: there will be minimal time for diplomacy and who knows what will break loose.

The best course to follow is the one that is indicated as likely to succeed by what you believe the other players will do, not the one with the highest absolute returns.<br/><br/>I imagine that the Italians would find it difficult to not be excited when they're in the race for winning the whole thing despite their weakness in earlier phases of the game. I've seen people recommend that veterans should let beginning players win their first game just to hook them into Diplomacy, as being a large Power and succeeding a lot is much closer to the typical rewards people associate with fun games than getting kicked in the head and lied to repeatedly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320901/#Comment_320901" name="Item_180" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-16T08:55:06+00:00" title="April 16, 2011  8:55AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not bad advice, that.<br/><br/>We will see how things go, and I will work on England and the "Southern Coalition" or Grand Alliance, as I have been calling them, separately.<br/><br/>This is an interesting game in that EVERY nation has been a major power at some point and has been reduced to one unit at another, with the exception of England, who has always been strong.<br/><br/>The plot is also getting more interesting: another player has learned how to "fake" message from the "anonymous advisor" and is now looking to turn the game into a win for England.

I could see a road to victory come from convincing Italy into an effective war against England, one where France and Germany are both re-established as small Powers only moments before you stab Italy and seize victory. Likewise, I could see success in turning from this road at a suitable moment to ally with England and then play on their naivete to scramble for the necessary quota of SCs.

There are both positives and negatives here.<br/><br/>Positives:<br/><br/>* I managed to get Italy into a defensive position against England in France (with two armies in place). Likewise, I convinced England to move into France with great force.<br/><br/>* Turkey is still growing, whereas England shrank a bit. Turkey is now the big boy in the game, at least in numbers. In fact, we miscounted SCs and I only built one unit instead of two. (You'll be able to see it from the map for yourselves.)<br/><br/>* Finally, England disbanded a fleet in the Atlantic realm, which means we could push through in the near future, if it's something worth doing.<br/><br/><br/>Negatives: the things that did not go so well.<br/><br/>* Italy took some more territory, and built several units. They're watching their back intently. But I think I may have won a little more of their trust as we worked together quite effectively. Italy is up to nine SCs now: nothing to scoff at, not too easily taken down.<br/><br/>* England somehow talked Germany into surrendering all his SCs to her, and he went for it. He thought he was being given something in return, apparently - although it was never clear what. I think England was promising to "let" Germany back into his territory (Germany) if he just gave her Munich and St. Petersburg right now. After the Spring, it was clear that Germany was dead: he had no SCs at all. I helped Germany win some territory back, but St. Petersburg is now permanently English.<br/><br/>* Austria and France both refused to cooperate but kept trying weird and unpredictable tactics instead. I had Italy take out Austria (with my help) and then I took out France. This is good in some ways: it simplifies the situation. Unfortunately, it has seriously delayed any sort of advance into Germany. I originally wanted at least France in there, and had my own army in Bohemia, but had to fall back in order to take France out of the picture. We had three allied armies in Berlin - Boh - Mun, but instead both Italy and I had to retreat to deal with France and Austria. I still don't understand what they were thinking... but they don't seem keen to explain themselves, either. Well, they're both dead now.<br/><br/>Why would someone with only one unit try to piss off their allies?

However, I need another army into the action, and quick. Should I build immediately? I'm thinking another army, so I can move the first one to Greece for convoy to Italy, and the other one towards Germany.<br/><br/>* What can be done to destabilize the situation? The best I can come up with right now is to convince Italy to slip through the Mid-Atlantic once again, maybe hint at how easy it would be for them to get into the Norwegian or North Sea, with access to Denmark, Norway, Sweden, etc., and then strike.<br/><br/>I will, of course, encourage Germany to create as much havoc as possible. Should I encourage Germany and England to work together against Italy? Probably not, although it could be useful in certain situations (e.g. if Italy is too successful against England).<br/><br/>* I've hinted to England that I might be willing to help them into Iberia (hopefully by inaction, as opposed to actual support). England lied to me last year but may be convinced to cooperate in some way.<br/><br/>Germany is also a bit of a wild card. He wants to survive, but I have a feeling he might still be swayed by England at any time.<br/><br/>Hmmm!<br/><br/>* Is it worth the time and effort to move another army in Sevastopol (Ank -&gt; Arm -&gt; Sev), instead of moving it into position to attack Italy? If I had that in place, I could move War -&gt; Prussia and Ukraine to War, so as to force Livonia to disband and then take St. Petersburg. I don't think England's too likely to bring another unit into play up there, but this attack takes up four of my units and requires two years to carry out.<br/><br/>The alternative is either waiting for England to suffer another disband, or moving Mos -&gt; Liv, with support from Warsaw, and Ukr -&gt; Moscow. This allows me to take StP if it goes through, but I don't particularly like having another English loose in the Silesian area.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321395/#Comment_321395" name="Item_186" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-20T21:14:54+00:00" title="April 20, 2011  9:14PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My current plan for Italy:<br/><br/>* To keep supporting them against England.

Your only chance at this point depends on the other players being unknowledgeable of Diplomacy end-games and the actual goals of the game; you're betting on their ignorance if you continue the game instead of simply eliminating Germany and declaring a draw. To make this work you need to discuss the game with them in a sort of foggy manner, eliding over the details of why given moves are made and what the end-goal of movements is and so on; this is difficult, as the dimmest player will over time come to wonder why, exactly, the game is being played. If England and Italy realize that you're playing them, they'll find it trivial to stop you.<br/><br/>Apparently the minority Powers simply cracked under the pressure; those moves by Germany, France and Austria seem difficult to understand otherwise. This is not unprecedented, players can get to be like caged wild animals, biting anything in biting distance, when the desperation gets to them. I don't wonder if they don't feel like explaining themselves after the fact.<br/><br/>The tactical position has interestingly shifted against England here in many ways. His northern position is now vulnerable, as is his position in Germany. Italy even got to Gascony. You can fuck England up pretty easily by moving some forces and helping Germany get back to Berlin and then up to the Nordic countries. I wonder how England could have made such a blunder - Denmark is completely open now, for example. Italy actually has a forced attack on Ruhr with Germany's help by cutting Burgundy from the south; you should definitely make that happen, an Italian wondering around in Ruhr would be a wonderful troops mix-up. Meanwhile your own position could be strengthened immeasurably by seizing StP and threatening an army assault on the Nordic SCs - unconventional surely and not something that could be done against a fleet defense, but apparently England doesn't feel the need to defend the Nordic area more than nominally.<br/><br/>Italy, meanwhile, has a more solid position. You can take  the Austrian SCs without too much trouble, one would expect, and Naples can be seized by surprise at the moment, but for the rest you'd depend on Italy's mistakes or English pressure to even things up. You have quite a few fleets and relatively few armies; your position against Italy would be much stronger if you could bring a couple new armies from Anatolia to convoy-distance of the Italian peninsula. For example, if you could seize Naples by an army convoy from Greece or such, then a follow-up attack on Rome would be much faster.<br/><br/>The question is still the same it has been for a while: what do you need to conquer to gain a solo victory? You're at 12 SCs, and will need to take Austria, StP and the Italian peninsula to win. (Theoretically a German SC would suffice here as well, or something from Iberia, but the Italian peninsula is clearly the easiest.) The current position is so favourable tactically that I'd be tempted to move now, before the other players realize the danger. If you could convince the Italian to dance to your tune on the spring move (eg. Mun-Ruh, Adr-Tyr), then you could have a pretty successful surprise right away. Sadly your position against StP wouldn't be quite ready yet.<br/><br/>If you think that you can delay one more year, then keep the Mediterranean position close to what it is now (except bring new armies closer), and try to improve your position against StP. Were I you, I'd definitely try for Livonia right away; the Livonian army in Prussia would not be an issue for you, while gaining StP early could be absolutely brilliant. Regardless, send that fourth army up: if you can't take the position with three armies, then you need it, and if you can take it, you'll need sufficient forces in the area to have something to send into Finland, Sweden, etc. Your Austrian position can be served sufficiently by three armies, especially as you can link up with your Warsaw position once your final push begins.<br/><br/>Your success in the end will probably come down to whether England and Italy can amass sufficient forces in the Tyr-Pru corridor to push through your defensive central line before you finish your conquests. Italy has four-ish armies in pertinent distance (although partially tied down by England), while England has three; the existence of Germany in German SCs might be crucial here, as Germany would be sure to interfere in attempts to use their homeland as a staging area. Your defensive line one year after the push begins would be roughly four armies in Liv-War, Vie and either Serbia or Trieste. (I'm assuming you'll send one more army up north and convoy one to the Italian peninsula.) If you can tie down the Italian fleet in Trieste, that'll help a lot - it'll be in the way of reinforcements from Venice, and it can't make the deadly attacks on Serbia or Budapest, which'll allow you to get by at least temporarily with a bit less than perfect line. Your ultimately ideal defensive positions in this situation would of course involve conquering Trieste and setting up your line in Tri-Tyr-Boh-Sil-Pru; that's a five-army job, but maybe you can detach one more from somewhere as the situation develops. Anyway, it's more likely that the Italian will hold tight on the Tyrolian position at least until you're in Venice - and when you're in Venice, the war is basically over, as you'll be at 18 SCs then (assuming you can take StP, that is).<br/><br/>Pretty interesting to see how this goes. Depending on how you and the others play, this might get concluded any moment now. If either England or Italy stumbles on the idea of a three-player draw, you might as well be gentlemanly and confess to them that this is the right solution, no need to waste time on struggling against it - just finish Germany off the board and end the game. (Of course you do this, and then launch your surprise attack and see whether they can back the draw with tactics.) Even if nobody suspects anything I don't really see much benefit for you in waiting more than one more year at most. That one year might be very useful in establishing the remainder of Germany, approaching StP and getting your armies closer to Italy, but any more than that and you'll run a severe risk of having Italy freak out on you due to your prominent position. If you think that Italy might get out of the currently rather beneficial Iberian position, for example, then it might be worthwhile to attack immediately.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321420/#Comment_321420" name="Item_188" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-21T08:14:56+00:00" title="April 21, 2011  8:14AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 21, 2011 8:26AM by Paul_T.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, yep! Very interesting. I have a feeling that the other players' grasp of tactics and overall strategy (I don't think anyone's aware a draw is an option in Diplomacy) may be very much in my favour here.<br/><br/>My tack will probably be to point out how weak England is to Italy. I've mentioned before that a single fleet slipping through could easily claim Norway, Sweden, Denmark, maybe Edinburgh, etc. If I can talk them into attacking through the Atlantic, it would be a strong thing in my favour.<br/><br/>Meanwhile:<br/><br/>What do you think about the fight over StP? I see two options: either I attack Livonia, with a 50/50 chance either way of success. But if nothing is gained, it's a waste of a turn.<br/><br/>However, I could also try to build a second army in Ankara and move it to Arm. Then I can try this: War -&gt; Pru, Mos -&gt; Liv (or hold, doesn't matter), Ukr -&gt; War. I probably lose Moscow that Spring, but am guaranteed to win it back once I get Sev into position.<br/><br/>What do you think?<br/><br/>Maybe the best option would be to try the 50/50 attacks on Livonia during the first year, and then once Sev is in place I can make the other move. Is it worth it, however? It ties up four armies for over a year. However, if England suffers other losses at the same time (like Denmark, for example) and disbands or retreats, I may even gain access to Sweden and Norway.<br/><br/>One benefit is that I should be able to convince Italy I'm fighting England full-on by doing this: I can approach them with a plan where I move North against England while supporting them into the Atlantic.<br/><br/>The key challenge is coordinating the timing of the attack on StP and the attack on Italy. Any further advice there?<br/><br/>My basic plan at this point is exactly what you outline: if I can keep Italy on board for just a year (long enough to get Army Con into Greece), I'll be in position to move on StP and Italy simultaneously.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321432/#Comment_321432" name="Item_189" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-21T10:58:16+00:00" title="April 21, 2011 10:58AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd go for the attack on StP immediately, but also send the Budapest army to Galicia as a backup. Whether the immediate attack succeeds or not you'll have use for a fourth army in that scene, and if you're not going to attack Italy this year, then you'll have time to bring the new forces to operative distance of Austria even as you fight for StP. Taking StP even before you attack Italy would only be a benefit as long as your success in StP doesn't trigger Italy to guard against your stab. The absolutely ideal case would have you actually sitting in StP next spring, in which case you might even have a reasonable shot at raiding Scandinavia as part of your final push, depending on how the German situation develops and where England opts to allocate their forces.<br/><br/>The idea of moving an army Ank-Arm-Sev is a bit weak in that it leaves an operation that does not need to and should not wait waiting, while forces that do not have a clear purpose until you attack Italy (your two armies in Ser-Bud) twiddle their thumbs. Better for you to send your new armies to the Balkans (it's your most vulnerable area in case of Italian counter-attack) and re-allocate one of those armies to the StP maneuvers. If the peace with Italy lasts, you can wait with your Italian stab until you have three armies in the Balkans; if it doesn't, then you can easily enough move on Vienna from Galicia while waiting for the reinforcements. Italy shouldn't even see this move as particularly dangerous, as you're just marching your forces north and west, just like you're supposed to in a war against England. Of course those forces have to pass through Budapest, that being the quickest way to Germany.<br/><br/>If you can convince the Italian to wage active war against England on any front, that's all basically positive for you. The best attack is always an attack on an unprotected flank of a strong Power, so anything that makes England weaker while tying up an ever-increasing percentage of Italian forces in occupying English SCs is to your benefit as the would-be attacker on Italy's eastern flank. When you make your bid for a solo victory, the real strategic issue will always be about unit parity: given that the rest of the board has more units than you do, the only way for you to triumph regardless is if the forces are either in the wrong positions to interefere, the wrong type to interfere or controlled by players who don't want or can't play the optimal defense. From this viewpoint every space you can move the Italo-English trench away from your own operational area in Italy is one more turn of freedom of operation for you: the units that are currently committed on the Atlantic front cannot stop you from winning before they travel to Italy, and the same goes for the continental armies that should push to Warsaw and Vienna to stop you. So push that Italian war on England, and try to ensure that even if they want to, the Italians can't detach from that war at a moment's notice. If England and Italy will basically waste their first turn after your stab on stabbing each other or moving forces in a carousel to get back into positions where they can retreat from each other's positions, then you'll probably win this thing just on the strength of the tactical confusion.<br/><br/>Also note for when you make your move: every Italian SC that falls to England after your stab is actually to your advantage, as England builds so far away from the decisive battle that any Italian units that are disbanded in that situation are basically lost for good. Your optimal stab will therefore definitely involve getting England into it: get England to attack Italy effectively on the same move you attack, and try to get England to think that you're attacking Italy together. In fact, give England some movement data or whatever else you can to make sure Italy takes losses both to you and England in that first chaos. This will also make it more difficult for them to band together against you even as you continue your own war against England unabated (or perhaps you don't if the board seems stupid enough to just allow you to win while remaining allied to England). Of course don't overdo this by letting England win, but I don't think this will be a serious problem with Germany still on the board.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321437/#Comment_321437" name="Item_190" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-21T11:36:48+00:00" title="April 21, 2011 11:36AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see what you mean.

Besides, you might want to attack on the fall move in three turns from now instead of in spring in two turns, depending on all sorts of detail. It's probably better to focus on moving your forces towards the west as a whole, and that is best achieved by moving eastern forces west and forces that are already pretty westerly, to the north. Total utility increases quickest this way, as you can recommit a maximum number of units to seizing Austria quickly if necessary this way, by turning back south with a portion of your northern force; after all, the StP thing is not absolutely, completely crucial if you have to choose between that and setting up your line against the west. (You want as many of your armies to be in position to form a vertical front against the west as possible, as the single quickest way for your soloing attempt to die is if Italy gets a random army through your line into Galicia or some such place where it can become a raider.)<br/><br/>Anyway, you have a fair chance at seizing StP with just the three armies by playing War-Pru, Ukr-War, Bud-Gal, should England opt to defend in place instead of playing Lvn-Pru. (If England plays StP-Mos you'll counter by Gal-Ukr and retake Mos in the fall, then take StP next year.) You'll know whether that's going to happen after the spring move, at which point you'll still have the option of simply keeping the Galician army in striking distance of Vienna by holding or moving to Bohemia or whatever. If you can get Italy to fortify Trieste with the fleet that'll make your position very defensible - the Italian unit itself prevents a dangerous army attack to Serbia or Albania, leaving only Budapest as a real vulnerable point. In this situation one of your armies can go speculate in Galicia quite nicely, as the other one present can cover Budapest. It'll seem rather natural from Italy, too.<br/><br/>It's notable that tactically speaking you don't really need to conquer Trieste and Venice quickly when you get to work; the real issue is that Italy and England shouldn't be allowed to mobilize effectively in the Tyr-Pru corridor and the Ven-Tri area, as armies there directly threaten the integrity of your own line. (As discussed, that's what's going to kill you: a breakthrough in the center.) It seems to me that this might well go down in a manner where you play a relatively slow game in Austria during the first 1-2 turns of your solo drive, simply because four of your armies are committed to a quick breakthrough in StP, one will be convoying to Italy and one of the rest will still be on the move, leaving only two to care for the Austrian situation. This won't really be a problem for you as long as you don't tarry so much that Italy gets to fortify Trieste entirely and use it as an anchor for an army line that takes and keeps Vienna. Doing this would take time for Italy, however, and they might be unable to achieve it entirely if eg. they're overextended in Ruhr or you manage to block the Piedmont access quickly. They only have two armies in eastern Europe at the moment, after all, and that might even go down if you convince them to play Tyr-Mun. What I mean is, tactically it might be that conquering Vienna and Trieste is merely your third objective after getting boots on the ground on the peninsula and resolving the StP question (which will free two armies to fortify the Pru-Sil area even if you opt to send an army to Finland). Of course a perfect surprise would involve simply walking into Vienna on the first turn of your attack, but that might be everything you do in that area until a few turns later when you free up forces from elsewhere. I already predicted earlier that Venice will likely be the last SC you take; could be that Trieste is that, instead, if you advance quickly on the peninsula and Italy moves to support Trieste from both Venice and Tyrolia.<br/><br/>All in all the tactical situation is not looking too bad; you should be able to take all of your objectives if England fails to bring forces to the Tyr-Pru corridor from the west and you can keep Italy from moving their western forces through Piedmont to succor Venice. I'd consider the former the more serious threat, but the latter is probably something you can do less about if Italy realizes the importance of that move and doesn't simply hold against England in Marseille or allow you to bounce them in Piedmont. Of course if Germany decides to join in stopping you and they all play optimal tactics, it'll be tight, and you'll probably fail because your central line leaks and an enemy raider gets through.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321770/#Comment_321770" name="Item_192" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-25T19:10:02+00:00" title="April 25, 2011  7:10PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh... interesting!<br/><br/>Another development: since we're all running out of time to finish the game, the Games Master has proposed that we change the endgame rules. He suggest we either play for a set number of turns, and then give victory to the one with the most SCs, or we reduce the number of SCs necessary for a victory.<br/><br/>In some ways this is tremendously in my favour: I am currently the front-runner, overall, and I don't have too many weak spots in my position.<br/><br/>In other ways, it sucks, since all the strategy I've been building on is dependent on overall endgame strategy. If we're playing to a set number of turns, for example, it's likely to devolve into either a free-for-all where everyone grabs what they can or all of the others turning on me fairly quickly, which could throw victory to someone else (it could happen quickly if the limit is quite low: say England and Italy ally against me, and then one stabs the other at an opportune moment, and the game's over).<br/><br/>I can see now how messing around with the end conditions really dramatically impacts play, but I'm not entirely sure I can talk the group out of doing things this way.<br/><br/>(As a side-note, however, it still seems to me - coming from a perspective of little experience with Diplomacy, of course - that changing the number of SCs necessary for a solo win conserves more of the strategy than another option like playing to a set number of turns, which is more about tactical play and grabbing what you can once you're close to the limit. Do you disagree? If so, why?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321783/#Comment_321783" name="Item_193" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-26T00:49:41+00:00" title="April 26, 2011 12:49AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Couldn't you just leave the game unresolved? Seems to me that changing the victory conditions at this late date lacks legitimacy anyway, and if the group is lacking motivation to play the game through, then surely it's no big deal to not resolve it fully. Instead of saying "I won" you can just say that the game was played close to the finish, you were in the lead, but it was left unfinished due to scheduling trouble. Nobody actually <i>needs</i> a full resolution of the game, after all. The play is the point after all, full resolution is just a cherry on top of the process.<br/><br/>Another similar option would be to declare a three-way tie: it's a likely outcome anyway, and if the group doesn't have motivation to play, any two of the remaining three great Powers can actually force the draw factually on the board, so just agreeing to it in the abstract is a very minor change to the game's procedures. I'd probably opt for this over either changing the rules or leaving the game unresolved, assuming that both Italy and England want to end the game. It does involve helping them along a bit, as you need to explain to them why and how they can force the game to end in a favourable manner, but at least it's a real draw they'll have achieved then, instead of a artificial sham victory or defeat.<br/><br/>A variant of the above option would be to play a set number of turns and then declare draw between the remaining Powers regardless of SC count. This would be essentially the same as above, except that Germany would have an opportunity to remain in the draw by tactical play. It'd be relatively pointless from my viewpoint, though, as whoever decided the draw deadline would effectively also determine whether Germany would live or die - his survival would not depend on making himself indispensable to the draw, but merely on hanging on until the end. Still, better than declaring a winner on SC count.<br/><br/>If you yourself feel very motivated to play to the end, I'd suggest contacting the GM privately and asking him to not rock your boat this close to the end; he's essentially fucking up your endgame by bringing the victory conditions themselves to the table as a negotiation item, which might in the worst case turn the rest of the board against you if everybody else ends up wanting to quit while you insist on continuing the game. The only honorable action for the GM here is to back the agreed-upon rules and leave the game unresolved if the players lack the time to finish it. I might also instruct the players as to legitimate ways of finishing if the game were educational in nature to begin with - this table could be finished within a year as a three-way draw, which should be preferable at least for Italy and, considering the diplomatic situation, also for England. While having the GM remind the other players about the drawing rules would be interference in the diplomatic process, I might prefer having informed players who make objectively good choices, especially if this meant that the game could be concluded fully within the available time-frame.<br/><br/>(Of course, I've no idea what philosophy your GM has on the victory rules of Diplomacy; for all I know he might think that draws aren't real endings and every game needs to have a victor. Might explain why he suggests ways to artificially introduce a sole victor instead of the much more natural draw solution. Perhaps you might convince him otherwise; at least four in five Diplomacy games ends in a draw anyway, so it seems foolish to try to force a solo victory when you want to end a game prematurely. I'd definitely prefer a solid draw out of this board position rather than an artificially induced victory.)<br/><br/>As for the optimal solution to playing less than full-length games, I do agree with you that playing a set number of turns is very disruptive to the game. Lowering the SC threshold of solo victory is probably the lesser of the two evils, although it has massive impact on the end-game too, as it directly changes the necessary defensive and offensive lines players need to reach to gain or deny solo quorums to the other players. I probably wouldn't mind this too much if the decision to lower the limit were made at the game start or at least before the end-game; in this case you've been counting SCs for a while, though, so changing the requirement would influence things quite a bit.<br/><br/>An interesting variant occurs to me: what if the soloing limit started from 34 SCs (full board, that is) at the game start and then dropped by one per year? Perhaps drop by two per year to make for a quicker game. This might be interesting in how it forces the game towards resolution over time. Probably not as interesting as the draw-focused play of standard Diplomacy, but if you needed to have a solo victory, that might be one of the more elegant ways of ensuring one in a reasonable time-frame.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321810/#Comment_321810" name="Item_194" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-26T08:55:05+00:00" title="April 26, 2011  8:55AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, that is a very interesting variation!<br/><br/>I've heard a similar one proposed, where you lose a unit every year: so only the nations who are growing maintain their strength, and stagnant nations slowly die off unless they can pull out of their eventual demise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322980/#Comment_322980" name="Item_195" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-03T20:39:00+00:00" title="May  3, 2011  8:39PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And... it is done.<br/><br/>The players were tired, some had passed on their orders to other people standing in for them. We negotiated for a long time, wondering how we could finish the game. Should we change the game end conditions? How could we ensure an ending?<br/><br/>Finally, I convinced them to just play out two years and *then* talk it over, knowing that I actually had a shot at the victory, but no one seemed to see it just yet.<br/><br/>In the first year (1924), I convinced them all to fight with each other, and offered England Marseilles, Spain, and Portugal in exchange for St. Petersburg. England went for it. I ended the year in possession of St. Petersburg while holding everywhere else.<br/><br/>In 1925, I attacked full-out against Italy, taking Vienna, Trieste, Rome, and Naples in one shot. Better yet, I managed to surround two of the three Italian armies defending the area, so they were forced to disband.<br/><br/>In Spring 1926 I was at 17 SCs, with only one Italian army within range to contest my attack on Venice: and I had an army in Trieste, an army in Apulia, and a fleet in the Adriatic.<br/><br/>All the other nations just had their units hold as I ordered Apulia to Venice, ending the game.<br/><br/>I'll post a map, if anyone's interested: Germany was the surprising recovery here, growing to four SCs and landing a fleet in Edinburgh.<br/><br/>Thanks, everyone for the advice. If you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them, or go over the history of the game. I've learned a lot: and it's pretty cool that my very first ever game ended as a solo victory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322982/#Comment_322982" name="Item_196" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-03T20:42:02+00:00" title="May  3, 2011  8:42PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, yes, a question:<br/><br/>Having played this game for near six months (we started in November), playing through a year a week (but missing many weeks), it's hard for me to imagine what a "normal" face-to-face is like.

Typically we'd start with 20 minutes on the first round and go to 10 minutes for the rest of the game, except for later in the game we might go down to five minutes if everybody feels that there's not anything to negotiate. (Can't go below five minutes and still have time to write the order sheet.) In practice this schedule allows you to play something like eight years per evening without stretching, so usually not a full game; my experience is that we do not usually play the game to the finish, but will rather agree to a negotiated winner or a coalition on the basis of SC count or position - a "moral winner", so to  speak. No big deal when you're playing with friends and purely for fun, anyway.<br/><br/>If I had to set up a full game face to face, I probably wouldn't go for a long schedule like you have here, but would rather play the game over a weekend: start on Friday night by playing the first two years, then continue until 1912 or so on Saturday and then finish the game over Sunday. This way there's not too much play on any single day, and the odds are that you'll be able to end the game; most full games tend to be over by 1915 or 1920 at the latest.<br/><br/>The ending you got here is not too atypical, a Diplomacy game often deteriorates in the real world near the end due to a lack of table discipline among the players, and due to a lack of game-closing skills, so the quality of play falls sharply towards the end. This is sort of a fault in the game as a social enterprise even if I can't acknowledge it as a fault in game design; it's not so much that the game fails to close gracefully, but that it is too beautiful for our imperfect world <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> Probably this could be helped a lot by educating the players on the goals and strategy of the game; Diplomacy is much quicker and above all more sensible in its endgame if all the players are familiar with the preferential endings, the draw theory and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323440/#Comment_323440" name="Item_198" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-07T21:08:27+00:00" title="May  7, 2011  9:08PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, thanks, very interesting!<br/><br/>This thread (and this game) has been really fascinating for me: there's a lot to learn from Diplomacy, both in terms of human dynamics and in terms of game design principles. The only danger being, of course, that one starts seeing all of life as one giant game of Diplomacy...<br/><br/>And I'm sure going from one unit on the map to a solo victory in a very first Diplomacy game has got to be at least somewhat unusual. A fun achievement, even if people's disengagement towards the end spoils the feeling somewhat.<br/><br/>Anyway, I really appreciate you taking the time to chat with me over this publicly. Lots of interesting thoughts, and I learned a lot.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, I was at an orchestra concert tonight featuring artists from Finland: Karita Mattila and Anssi Karttunen, conducted by Hannu Lintu, playing music (in premiere) by Kaija Saariaho (who was also present).

I'll have to travel to your part of the world sometime: the closest I've been is Karelia (which used to be part of Finland, as I understand).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13406/help-with-diplomacy-needed-strategy/p3" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13406/help-with-diplomacy-needed-strategy">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13406/help-with-diplomacy-needed-strategy/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13406/help-with-diplomacy-needed-strategy/p3" rel="prev">3</a><a class="Highlight p-4 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13406/help-with-diplomacy-needed-strategy/p4">4</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F13406%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F13406%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
