I've put this under Directed Promotion because it doesn't seem to fit anywhere else. I've found it useful and informative when other people have posted similar reports in the past. Hopefully someone will get something out of this report as well.<br/><br/>Matt and I released Panty Explosion at Gencon  2006. It's been one year and a few week since the book has been available. Our goal and expectation was to sell 250 copies of the book.<br/><br/><b>1294 copies sold since August 2006.</b><br/><br/><br/>Here's a list of the places we've sold Panty explosion over the last year<br/><br/>Gencon, August 2006<br/>Atarashi Games onlne store, August 2006<br/>DrivethruRPG, September 2006<br/>ENWorld, September 2006<br/>Lulu, September 2006<br/>e23, October 2006<br/>Key 20, October 2006<br/>Arima, November 2006<br/>RPGNOW, November 2006<br/>IPR, November 2006<br/><br/>We sell Panty Explosion in both book and PDF form through  large number of outlets. Our primary sales source is our own site, where we sell to both gamers and retailers. Here's an estimated sales breakdown.<br/><br/>Sales through Atarashi Games store: 479 (272 books, 207 PDFs)<br/><br/>Sales through distribution: 396<br/><br/>Sales through 3rd party (IPR , Lulu and Key20): 208<br/><br/>Sales through PDF 3rd party: 211<br/><br/>Notes:<br/><br/>- More then half our sales from the Atarashi Games store are shipped to overseas customers. Our top 5 foreign buyers are England, Japan, Norway, South Korea and Spain.<br/><br/>-IPR didn't receive copies of Panty Explosion until after the book had already been available for several months. When IPR sold out in late 2006 we were only able to send them 8 books to refill their stock. Those sold fast as well. As a result, IPR has been effectively sold out of the book all year. Sloppy planing on my part has resulted in poor sales for IPR. I feel the book could have done better there otherwise.<br/><br/><br/>Jake Richmond<br/>atarashigames.com                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92545/#Comment_92545" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-02T04:41:49+00:00" title="September  2, 2007  4:41AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Holy crap, that's amazing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92557/#Comment_92557" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-02T07:20:29+00:00" title="September  2, 2007  7:20AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you managed to tap into a sizable market that's not the usual indie RPG crowd, and obviously that's paying off.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92562/#Comment_92562" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-02T08:44:13+00:00" title="September  2, 2007  8:44AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good job, you guys.

I intend to publish The Year We All Died at that size. We've received a lot of feedback on both the format and art.

I have a good relationship with Jason, but I'd like to eventually deal with the distributors on my own. At the moment PE is distributed by Alliance, Blackhawk, Esdivium, ACD and one or two other distributor who I can't remember. I'm currently looking for more foriegn distributors to get the book into countries that are buying it off our site anyway. \n<blockquote>I take it Powell's is an independent bookstore, but not usually much of an RPG seller?</blockquote>\nPowell's is, as far as I know, the biggest bookstore in North America (and considered one of the best). We get tourists from all over the place who come just for Powell's. Powell's actually does have a pretty good selection of RPGs. Probably the best in town. \n<blockquote>it may be lacking significant info the the Robot Vagina Heart Flower doesn't convey.</blockquote>\nMy copy arrives via Matt from Gencon tonight (finally)!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord" title="SquidLord"><img alt="SquidLord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/690/n6I44LRPBAB7W.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord">SquidLord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93533/#Comment_93533" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-06T13:24:54+00:00" title="September  6, 2007  1:24PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>That's pretty great. can you tell me the name of the store?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>That'd be <a href="http://www.tychesgames.com/" rel="nofollow"><em>Tyche's Games</em></a> in Athens.

That being said, so is 6x9. Which is why I like buying games with a 6x9 or lower format and getting the PDFs, taking them to Kinko's, and having them printed 8.5x11 with a coil binding. The scaled-up content means everybody around the table can see the book, regardless, and the coil binding keeps it laying flat. Total win across the board -- except when I don't have a PDF.</p>\n<p>Which reminds me, I need to ping Ben about that. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93540/#Comment_93540" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-06T14:06:55+00:00" title="September  6, 2007  2:06PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 6, 2007 4:36PM by misuba.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: iago</cite><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite>Don't forget the Powell's copies; those didn't get there through IPR.

I don't know what their distribution situation is; I know they have a small-books shelf that looks terribly out of place in their games section, with copies of BW and BE, several copies of Elfs, and (as of yesterday) a half-price copy of PTA for some reason. <br/><br/>I gather their game selection is pretty uncharacteristic of independent bookstores, even large ones.
