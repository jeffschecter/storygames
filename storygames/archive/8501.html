So forgive me if I am wrong in my interpretations or usage of terms (please correct me) or if I am using old theories. Also, I am posting here and not on the Forge because I \u201cam\u201d here and not on the Forge.)<br/></span><br/>I was watching my 2 years old son playing, and especially \u201cplaying pretend\u201d, that proto-rpg form (I supposed this is contested), and started analyzing it in G/N/S terms. Of course it\u2019s outside the big model scope (not a rpg, not a group, \u2026), but I wanted to share that.<br/><br/>What he\u2019s doing now is Simulationism. He imitates, impersonates. For example, he pretends he\u2019s cooking by mixing the cat\u2019s food with the cat\u2019s water, stirring the mixture with a spoon or a pen. He wants to put the resulting mess in the oven. We indulge him, he done gloves to put and remove things from the (cold) oven. He takes a cloth (any cloth, or a paper handkerchief) and rubs different surfaces to clean them. This sort of things. He seems interested in authenticity and fidelity in his imitations. Sim.<br/><br/>Gamism and narrativism are not yet apparent, but seems to be fare on the horizon.<br/><br/>Competition isn\u2019t friendly at that age: it\u2019s pure competition, not a game. But there is already provocation: faking a conflict / aggression to get a reaction (usually to get attention). Maybe it\u2019s the start of gamism?<br/><br/>For narrativism, he of course doesn\u2019t \u201caddress premise in a lit 101 sense\u201d <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> But there is sometime a story-structure to his games. Second, I may sometime detect a tension-release rhythm. Is this proto-nar?<br/><br/>To me it seems at least to validate Sim as an actual, independent mode.<br/><br/>What do you think? One can find many analogies and analysis based on child development (analogies with evolution, analysis of difficulties of certain concept, \u2026). Is this useful for furthering our understanding of our enjoyment and its different modes / priorities? Or am I only narcissist?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188450/#Comment_188450" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-15T07:12:08+00:00" title="January 15, 2009  7:12AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 15, 2009 7:18AM by lumpley.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Every creative agenda's fulfillment depends on, at base, believable action*.

As he imitates, he tries to act in ways that fit his perception/model of reality. I know I was stretching GNS very far off, but I wonder if it can be interesting. I suppose it is interesting for people who study psychological or behavioral development, and they surely study this much more seriously, but could it be interesting for rpg-theory to study what could be rpg evolutionary ancestor?\n<blockquote>Here's my disclaimer to match yours: I don't question your observations<i>a bit</i>!

He's \u201cjust acting\u201d. Instinct programing? He does what kids do. Fundemental behaviour. Something like that. He obviously has fun doing that (evolutionary tool for learning?), it's a pleasurable activity for him. It's kind of solitary rpg. With mime instead of description. Kind of non-shared imaginary space superposed on reality (well, you can share this unSIS if you want, and sometimes he want you too, like when he asks you to switch on the lights in or ring the doorbell off his cardboard house, which has neither). \n<blockquote>Kids can express their own internal ideas, and reflect ideas they perceive from the world around them, but synthesis is pretty rudimentary.</blockquote> Yes.\n<blockquote>Watch how groups of kids do imaginative play<span style="text-decoration: underline;">together</span>.
