I had promised to run a Firefly game and have several different fronts going in my head that should keep the players interested no matter which way they go. Originally, it was slated to be a Savage Worlds game, but the more I think on it, the more I'm leaning towards Apocalypse World. Regardless,the part of this that's been troubling me has been the PCs, the crew of the Firefly class vessel, the Seraphim, and how to assemble an interesting group of PCs that aren't carbon copies of Joss Whedon's characters.<br/><br/>I have matched each of the characters from Firefly to playbooks from Apocalypse World and then from there I will generate the PCs. But I finally hit upon an angle that will keep my players trying to stay one step ahead of the law. The war vets of the group will be ex-Alliance soldiers, men and women who took the propaganda that the Alliance fed 'em as the gospel truth, honorable warriors fighting for what they were told was right. Then they went on a mission and were framed for a crime; they were used to cover up an awful massacre of innocents by Alliance forces. When they realized they had been betrayed they made a break for it and have been on the run ever since, trying to prove their innocence and helping those who can't help themselves.<br/><br/>What do y'all think? Throw the feedback and suggestions my way!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chugosh" title="Chugosh"><img alt="Chugosh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/289/nOED25F16XENN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chugosh">Chugosh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410441/#Comment_410441" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-25T21:47:55+00:00" title="March 25, 2013  9:47PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that is a fantastic idea!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410442/#Comment_410442" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-26T00:38:05+00:00" title="March 26, 2013 12:38AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.

Make sure you get them access to some dynamite and a vehicle they can weld some armor onto.<br/><br/>Just doing whatever playbook conversion is needed is probably all the PC creation you need to do. Instead of "generating the PCs", I think you should work on generating a list of provocative questions (which can attach certain elements as the question is asked) and let the player collaborate in the character creation process through answering the questions.<br/><br/>For a convention game, it's important to get quickly to a pressing situation. Give them a goal (or multiple, somewhat conflicting goals) and constraints about how to meet that goal (time and/or fuel is short so they only have time/fuel for 1 space trip during the game, or the ship is messed up so they must work planetside for most of the game, or something like that). For a campaign, you could be more loose and spend more time following the characters around, but for a con game, setting some goals and constraints in advance are a great way to keep the game focused on something you can resolve in a few hours without getting into the bad sides of railroading.<br/><br/>If you want to push yourself as a GM, you could have the players help you create the goals and constraints at the table - again through provocative questions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/connallmac" title="connallmac"><img alt="connallmac" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/connallmac">connallmac</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410507/#Comment_410507" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-26T18:05:34+00:00" title="March 26, 2013  6:05PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I plan to start the game, In Media Res, perhaps the crew trying to duck an Alliance warship.<br/><br/>I ran Dungeon World at a convention the weekend before last, and left the character creation to the players at the event, figuring it was also a chance to show off the simplicity of the system. But for this event I want it a little more structured, as I plan to have a lot going on in the adventure and don't want to take the time to make characters. I plan to keep the players pretty much on board a space station for the majority of the game, but I plan to keep Reivers in my back pocket if I need to shake things up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
