So here's a little experiment/intellectual exercise i thought might be fun for us to do. Here's the skinny:<br/><br/>1. Pick a movie or TV show you enjoy. <br/>2. Assume the main character(s) is/are the PC(s) in an RPG. Assume the content of the show/movie is the fiction created in play by the game. <br/>3. From what you've seen in the movie/show answer the Big Three questions about the "game's" design.<br/>4. Write up your answers and post them in this thread.<br/>5. Go have a cookie for doing such a good job.<br/><br/>The big three, for those that are unfamiliar, is a set of three simple probing questions to be asked about a game's design/place in the world that, despite their simplicity, tell you a great deal about the play experience. For this experiment here are The Big Three:<br/><br/>What is the game about?<br/>How is the game about that?<br/>How does the game reward the players for acting on/participating what the game is about?<br/><br/>That last question needs some clarification. Often this is a question about reward cycles and experience and so on; For this experiment I would like us to consider how the fiction rewards it's characters for participation. Do the characters grow? find absolution? get rich? get powerful? <br/><br/>I would like to examine as many different movies/shows as we can but if someone else has already written up answers for the IP you were interested in, and you feel like your answers would be pretty different, go ahead and post up a new response.<br/><br/>I'm going to list here some things i would like to see examined, feel free to ignore this list completely and just pick your favorite show, or work from the list if you are interested but can't make up your mind about what to examine.<br/><br/>\u2022 The wire<br/>\u2022 Star Trek (in case you want to nitpick, lets just say original series or next gen)<br/>\u2022 Iron Man<br/>\u2022 Children of Men<br/>\u2022 Sex in the City<br/>\u2022 M.A.S.H.<br/>\u2022 The Sopranos<br/>\u2022 Spongebob Squarepants<br/>\u2022 Alien (and of the 4 films)<br/>\u2022 The Shield <br/>\u2022 Sports Night<br/>\u2022 Seinfeld                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180034/#Comment_180034" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-24T10:57:08+00:00" title="November 24, 2008 10:57AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 24, 2008 10:59AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The Wild Bunch</b><br/><b>What is the game about?</b>  Loyalty and the masculine ideal of true brotherhood, and changing times<br/><b>How is the game about that? </b> Even the <i>enemies </i>are loyal to the protagonists, across great swathes of personal history.  Bishop is loyal to his gang, and Dutch is loyal to him unto death.  The gang learns what it means to stick together and take care of their own, even when the cost is too terrible to contemplate.  At one point Bishop says:  "We're not gonna get rid of <i>anybody</i>! We're gonna stick together, just like it <i>used </i>to be! When you side with a man, you stay <i>with </i>him! And if you can't do that, you're like some <i>animal</i>, you're <i>finished</i>! <i>We're</i> finished! <i>All </i>of us! " which is a neat summary of the entire movie.  Those themes are relentlessly reinforced, to the point where men gladly die for them rather than face a cruel and stupid new era.  It's 1913, for Pete's sake!  You can't keep being a bandit in the twentieth century!  <br/><b>How does the game reward the players for acting on/participating what the game is about?</b>  The protagonists demonstrate their fidelity to one another in a final, joyous, suicidal act of bravery and folly.  Many Mexicans are machine-gunned in the process.  They die in the old way, upright and meeting the standards of true men in the eyes of their peers (and Bishop's frenemy Pike, of course, who picked the other side and regrets it).  They die by the code they lived by rather than crawl into a diminished future.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180136/#Comment_180136" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-24T16:50:23+00:00" title="November 24, 2008  4:50PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What a wonderful idea.<br/><br/><b>Spooks</b><br/><br/><b>What is the game about?</b> What do you believe in?

It deliberately toys with issues that are close to the bone: terrorism, Al Qaeda, financial crises. Its main characters need to work together to get things done but are constantly encouraged to suspect each other. Nobody really knows what anyone's thinking.<br/><br/>(I realise that only the last two are actually important, but the others seemed tangentially relevant).<br/><br/><b>How does the game reward the players for acting on/participating what the game is about?</b>The player characters all have secret goals, which aren't revealed to the other players. The GM's job is to tempt them to achieve these goals by unconventional means: so you want to protect your country? Maybe you need to leak its secrets to someone who can protect it?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180164/#Comment_180164" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-24T21:33:38+00:00" title="November 24, 2008  9:33PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sex in the City<br/>\nWhat is the game about?<br/>\nSelf discovery<br/>\n<br/>\nHow is the game about that?<br/>\nThe character has friends, readers and romantic experiences that prove/disprove various theories about life, love and friendship<br/>\n<br/>\nHow does the game reward the players for acting on/participating what the game is about?<br/>\nThe character does not advannce through the story until she can understand something she needs or why she wants something<br/>\n<br/>\n  There is many different ways to slice that show, so I dunno if this is solid, but it feels close to me...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180169/#Comment_180169" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-24T22:23:39+00:00" title="November 24, 2008 10:23PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Star Wars: A new hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<b>What is the game about?</b>  Being part of something bigger than just yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>How is the game about that?</b> The game starts with characters who all come at the question from a different angle.  Luke desperately wants to be part of something bigger than himself but does the poor farm boy have what it takes to become a Jedi?  Han has no desire for anything beyond his own self intereste but when love and friendship are built through play what will his answer be, does he truly only value himself?  Obi Wan is a Jedi Knight and already part of something fairly big but when the time comes to sacrifice himself is he willing to do it?  Vader is the flip side of that coin, he is part of something big (and nasty) but when it comes down to it is pursuing that power worth it or is family actually bigger than that Power?  The force is really a mystical symbol of that greater Power than just yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>How does the game reward the players for acting on/participating with what the game is about?</b>  By participating and resolving the smaller internal issues the characters face the player pushes the game forward to dealing with the the big galactic scale issues going on in the background, the battle of good versus evil.

It centers on themes of mortality, memory, emotion, and the desperate need for things (even created things) to live.  It is wrapped in a police procedural plot structure.<br/>\n<br/>\n+It optionally has an undercurrent of self-discovery and self-incrimination built in for advanced players.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow is the game about that?<br/>\n<br/>\n+ Players investigate leads to discover the locations and disguises of Replicants.  Once the target is confirmed through investigation and/or testing, the player group "retires" the Replicant (the term "kill" is not used for this process, to drive home the artificial nature of these beings).  <br/>\n<br/>\n+ Retirement scenes and clues in the investigation phase are meant to provide various weighted realization to the PCs that these creatures are very close to humanity in outlook and general condition.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow does the game reward the players for acting on/participating what the game is about?<br/>\n<br/>\n+ As clues are found, or missions finished, the impact of the Replicants perceived humanity slowly chips away at the starting buffer of acceptance that the PC has for what they do.  Once this score drops to zero, the PC begins to see a startling truth, based on what options the GM has selected.  Either they come to regard Replicants as equals and finally begin to see the utility of mercy to them, or (in the darker option), they begin to understand that they are a Replicant given the memories of a recently injured or killed Blade Runner (who they are assigned to take revenge for as their first mission).<br/>\n<br/>\n+ The player's choice of how they handle this revelation determines how the first duel they lose is resolved.  If the Replicant who obtains victory over them sees empathy in them (or kinship), he or she may spare them (endings are based on a measure of empathy vs cruelty in a system similar to endgames in MLwM).<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, this is more a story than a game...the three questions apply more to a system for creating numerous stories of the same type...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
