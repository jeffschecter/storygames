It predates the founding of Dog-eared Designs is how old it is. That's a thousand mayfly lifetimes.<br/><br/>Fellow indie publishers, you know well that designing and writing your game, getting it printed, working with artists and marketing it was hard work and one hell of a learning experience.<br/><br/>So if you have a moment, maybe you can help me brainstorm some bullets for a resume. Off the top of my head I'm imagining things like founding a company, coordinating with people, doing a fuckload of writing, etc.<br/><br/>Jason? Tony? I know you guys are often around.

Totally write more than you will need for any one job, and then pare down what's irrelevant to the specific job when making the job-specific resume.  Other things:<br/>* You should only be sending out job-specific resumes.  Don't use generic resumes; their effectiveness is abyssmal.<br/>* You should have your name and the job you want right next to each other on the top of the page.  Each resume should forge a strong association between YOU and JOB; use all of your graphic designer mojo to make that happen.<br/>* Unless you work in IT, your resume should never be longer than one side of one sheet of paper.  Concentrate all your awesome into one place; most employers will not read more than that, anyway (they are sifting through tons of resumes).<br/>* Your resume should always be photocopiable.  Nine times out of ten, your resume is going to get received and filed by an HR flunky and photocopies sent to the people who do the actual hiring decision making.  How do I know this?  I was that HR flunky.<br/>* Don't worry about complete sentences (this coming from me!); employers should be able to scan, not read, your qualifications.<br/><br/>More indie-press related, if you've ever been on any of the game design panels at conventions, totally list that as being a panelist on a publishing seminar.<br/><br/>I forget how long Dog-Eared Designs has been around, but if it's more than a year and a half, say how long you've been running AT A PROFIT.  Those three words are important, and become more importatnt the smaller the company you're interviewing at (big companies will involve people further from the bottom line and with less appreciation).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61289/#Comment_61289" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-16T07:40:57+00:00" title="March 16, 2007  7:40AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Funny this thread should be floating about, as I too have need of it!

It should be accurate / truthful, and absolutely customized to the position you are seeking.<br/><br/>The one-page can be a non-starter; I get plenty of resumes which are two pages and it doesn't disqualify folks out of the gate.  <br/><br/>When I'm reviewing resumes, I'm interested in accomplishments, not tasks.  Especially as positions move up the food chain, I'm looking for the impact a person has, and not a grocery list of their assignments. I also look for increasing levels of responsibility (again, for positions which aren't entry-level).<br/><br/>Whenever humanly possible, get the resume to the hiring manager directly - they're the ones with the open position. <br/><br/>And spell-check, spell-check, spell-check, spell-check, edit, spell-check.  All of which should be old hand to any publisher, but you'd be amazed at the sloppy resumes I've seen. If I can't count on a candidate to put their own resume in the best light, I really don't expect them to do any better with the work I'd assign them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
