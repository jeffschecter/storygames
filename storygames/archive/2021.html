                    As I posted in Matt's big thread:
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Larry</cite><cite>Posted By: crowyhead</cite>But for me, access to the stuff was the most difficult thing -- I found the comic stores intimidating, and it wasn't until my local library started getting graphic novels and I started to become familiar with what I liked, that I felt comfortable venturing into the store to find more.  I honestly think one of the reasons comics are taking off is that it's easier to find them in mainstream bookstores and libraries -- there isn't the same barrier to the casual dabbler.</blockquote>
Interesting. Has anybody donated<i>games</i>to libraries, or know of any companies that have done such a thing?<br/><br/><br/>My thought here was, if we're seriously interested in getting games (or your game, specifically) in front of a general, cultural audience, (as opposed to consumer geeks) the public library seems like culturally mainstream way that curious folks can see what all the fuss is about with little investment up-front.<br/><br/>Presumably, this might (or might not) be justfiable as a "marketing expense" too, so I'm also interested if anyone's got any thoughts on the business angle of this.<br/><br/>I have a relevant anecdote about this subject. After I found out about "Dungeons &amp; Dragons" in an old issue of <i>Dynamite!</i>, the first place I went to look for information was my public library. There was exactly <a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-Dungeons-Dragons-John-Butterfield/dp/0140064605/ref=ed_oe_p/104-5514262-0849504" rel="nofollow">one relevant title</a> in the place. That book turned out to not actually contain the rules for how to play the game! I finally pieced together that I'd have to <i>buy</i> something -- a Big Deal for a kid -- and settled on the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic set (3rd edition red box), almost certainly due to TSR's careful marketing.                </div>

                            I just changed emails with a local librarian about this. It seems that many libraries see RPGs as being a big theft problem (what the fuck that says about our fellow gamers leave to you) and so money doesn't often get spent on them. Furthermore, even donated RPGs are often sold off at library sales in order to raise money, rather than being left on the shelf. <br/><br/>This annoys me, and I'm passing it up the ladder, but I don't expect it much to change. <br/><br/>However, there is an SF reference only library in Toronto, and they apparently have a few games and may be interested in more. So there is hope.                        </div>

                            Here's my take on this, as a librarian:<br/><br/>Brand's right in that depending on the library's collection development policy, donated game books might just be sold of by the friend's of the library group.  A lot of libraries have a policy of not putting donations on the shelves, mainly because the stuff people donate tends not to be stuff that actually circulates, and circulation statistics (that is, check-outs) are what tend to determine funding.<br/><br/>The other problem is, even if the library accepts donations, there's a chance that the book will sit on the shelf and eventually be discarded, unless the librarians know to direct people to it, or unless there's already a community need.<br/><br/>So what's the best way to get games in libraries?  First thing, make friends with a librarian.  Extra bonus points if you can find a librarian who's already into gaming.  Teen/young adult services librarians would probably be a good place to start.  Tell them that you think story games are great, and have a place in the library.  And then, here's the biggie: tell them you'll help them get teens interested in the things.  Because even a pro-gaming librarian is going to be skeptical if they don't already have a population using their library who's into gaming.  Offer to run an afterschool game.  If you have a lot of energy, offer to do it on a regular basis.  This'll get kids interested, and in the process, it'll make it evident to the library that having storygames on the shelves is a good thing.                        </div>

                            Our local library has a couple of enthusiastic aides-- in fact, not only do they stock RPGs, they coordinate game days and put on a local convention last year.  A few years earlier, alongside several traditional boardgames, the teen outreach program included a couple of D&amp;D events.  (Run by an entirely different branch and person.)<br/><br/>It can be done... but how you get gaming agents into the library still isn't as clear.  (Other than volunteering yourself, of course.)                        </div>

                            My wife is a young adult librarian for a large system (Durham, NC, USA) and there's an AP thread on The Forge about an insano "Teen Tuesday" D&amp;D game I ran for her a while back.  Her library outsources cataloguing, and donating books for the collection is a huge amount of trouble and expense for them (just donating them for the book sale is just gravy).  She's purchased three copies of the D&amp;D player's handbook and they circulate "not so well", but they haven't lost any to theft or procedural error.                        </div>

                            Some years ago I operated a game store, and local libraries were some of our most loyal repeat customers. Mostly they would buy the latest board games, the ones on the <i>Spiel des Jahres</i> shortlist, and classics like chess sets and <i>Trivial Pursuit</i>. Into some of them we managed to sneak the occasional <i>D&amp;D</i> Starter Set or <i>Das Schwarze Auge</i> Basic Set.<br/><br/>In the wake of the fourth book of <i>Harry Potter</i> being published we offered to two or three libraries the organisation of a <b>Harry Potter Game Day</b> at their venue, at a date to be set by them. They would have to do a little marketing (a poster in their rooms) while we would bring the games and people to demonstrate them. Among the games we had selected was a <i>Clue/Cluedo<i></i></i>-like boardgame named <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/2546" rel="nofollow"><i>Elixir</i></a> (close enough to <i>Harry Potter</i>) - and a role playing game set in Hogwarts. One of our employees had created a minimalistic rule set, just a character sheet that was in fact the report card of a pupil, and a very simple die roll mechanism in which the player had to roll against his character's grades - very intuitive.<br/><br/>Two libraries took the offer, and the game days were a big success - for the libraries. Not that much for our store, because there wasn't a commercial <i>Harry Potter RPG</i> that we could sell to all those enthused proto customers!<br/>But by the time the <i>Lord of the Rings </i>movies came around we totally had forgotten about that kind of marketing.<br/><br/>From my experience libraries love that kind of event. They also have to compete against modern, electronic media. They need events that help them drawing attention to them, their services, their books, and reading in general.<br/>(They actually booked us during christmas season to give talks about board games and gaming trends.)<br/><br/>And...<br/><br/>IF I ever finish the RPG design I am working on (and off and on and off) I absolutely want to do playtest sessions at a local library. (It is a beginner level game aimed at children.) You will get AP reports, either here or over at the Forge, if it happens.<br/><br/>Dirk                        </div>

Hi Harald,<br/><br/>of course you are right. <br/><br/>What I am working on is not the rules design but the physical stuff that is needed to play the game, mainly handouts and a few playing cards.<br/>As a game aimed at children (early to mid teens) it is made up by more than just the rules text (which is not even written as I know that I can only start <i>after </i>several playtests).<br/>But the physical stuff is what the players use and see during the game, and I know that plain index cards with handwritten notes would not have caught my fancy when I was in that (target) age. So I need to embellish them with illustrations (stolen from comic books) and minimum aesthetics.<br/>I have to have something to show to the library people as well.<br/><br/>My plan is to have something presentable by the end of January. 
<blockquote>PS: I played an incarnation of that game a few years back (two? three?) and it certainly is a good entry level game except maybe for the funky d12.</blockquote>
No, that was a different one. My take at a fantasy heartbreaker was not meant for a public release (other than maybe an insert or special edition of the game store newsletter I did back then, Mondbuchstaben). And of course it had to use the d12 - being a D&amp;D-hack in which everything was smaller (fewer classes, fewer skills, fewer everything) I could not leave that monstrous die, the d20, in. <br/><br/>Dirk                        </div>

                            I recently checked out he Player's Guide to Ebberon from my local library.  What surprised me was the organization-- after a very short intro chapter, it's set up like an encyclopedia. Alphabetical, and 2 or so page articles on each topic, to be read in any order, kind of as reference.  I was surprised to find something that sounds so similar to Mu's organization released by WotC...                        </div>
