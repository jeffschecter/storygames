Here's another one, a bit different. I hope you find this a good idea. Trying to be very constructive here.<br/><br/>The idea is to use this thread in a very practical way. To post very simple and nonthreatening tools to be used in RPGs, involving touch in some way.<br/><br/>I will start:<br/><br/><i><b>The handshake</b><br/>Opening a roleplaying game, I recommend GMs to take each player in the hand, as old custom dictates, and give a greeting (say your name if you are strangers) while meeting their eyes. The handshake makes a "one-on-one bubble" around the two of you. The contact achieved in this "bubble" is a very effective foundation for the intercourse you and your players are engaging in, in a roleplaying game. It will make the players trust your ability to see them. As a leader you may build on this trust to further your game.<br/><br/>Do the handshake with each and every player at the start of each gamesession.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_165862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165862/#Comment_165862" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T23:40:30+00:00" title="August 27, 2008 11:40PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 27, 2008 11:48PM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Filip: to give thanks for the game is very nice, at the end of the game session. To do so by a handshake is good.<br/><br/>As for "boring anti touching people": I believe it is far more unsettling to talk about touch than to actually do it. A hug or a handshake is an ordinary thing. To talk about hugs and so on is a bit more ... touchy.<br/><br/><i><b>The friendship double handshake</b><br/><br/>If in the course of a game two characters become friends it is manifested by a double handshake. You take the hands of each others, hold them between you and say: "I am your friend!" Both say this, one at a time. You may choose to use the character name while saying it, like this: "Zopher is your friend!" It's a simple ritual to celebrate the friendship, and to strengthen the emotional content of it. This may be done between players, and between GM and players.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165863/#Comment_165863" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T23:47:39+00:00" title="August 27, 2008 11:47PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This one might not be so nonthreatening - let me know if I'm going in the wrong direction:<br/><br/><i><b>The touch of authority</b><br/><br/>As a GM playing a NPC figure of authority, get up and stand behind one of the players.

This will create a strong link between the two of you. You'll have his undivided attention for a moment, and will convey a message of unflinching trust.

We have to face it: most PCs are heroes, people who have an almost magical drive to be laid with whatever is out there. This is a simple tool, not to simulate sex, but to symbolize that the PC have had it.<br/><br/><i><b>The sex-handhold</b><br/><br/>A player may decide that his character have had sex. To symbolize this he may take the hand of either one of his co-players, or his GM. Holding hands with a co-player means that your characters have had good sex (so good it will show on the characters, maybe even as a small mechanical bonus: "In the flow +1"). Holding hands with the GM means that your character have had good sex with an NPC.<br/><br/>It's not necessary to do this every time you've had sex. Use it when appropriate, when it will help give the game some detail and depth. Do it in a silent way, or in a jubilant way, according to the personality of your character and his/her partner in love. Silent: take the hand and make nothing more out of it. Jubilant: take the hand and lift it as a winner of a boxing match, or smile broadly, or make jests about last night.<br/><br/>Either way: make it a small nugget in gameplay, to deepen your immersion in the character and/or to strengthen interaction within the group.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_166623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166623/#Comment_166623" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-02T11:07:59+00:00" title="September  2, 2008 11:07AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 2, 2008 11:10AM by TomasHVM.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i><b>Circle of trust</b><br/><br/>A simple way of opening the game-session.

And he will have the benefit of reacting to your gentle steering of his head, feeling a bit overruled both physically and mentally by this grip. Let go when the possession is discovered, or whenever it is appropriate in the scene, but make sure to keep the grip long enough to make the player a "puppet" in your hand (wait for him to relax, and if he don't: tell him he must relax to make you let go).</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_168943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168943/#Comment_168943" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-14T06:22:31+00:00" title="September 14, 2008  6:22AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 14, 2008 6:23AM by TomasHVM.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These last three tools are made for the GM to intimidate and dominate players, as an effect and/or support of what is going on in the fiction, to help them understand how the character may struggle to break free from domination, suppression or possession. <br/><br/>To dominate characters is very hard in classical RPGs, at least in a way that makes the players really identify with it. The player tend to defend himself, and his character, by using his own freedom of action. So he will shake of dominance as if it's a fly on his shoulder. As you grip the player in a dominating way, his freedom is restricted, and an easy break of dominance becomes less of an option for him. By using tools like this you give the player a taste of the quite interesting frame of mind usually existing in a servant or slave.<br/><br/>These tools may lift a scene to new heights, especially if the player connects to the feeling created by them, and play on it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168955/#Comment_168955" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-14T08:50:43+00:00" title="September 14, 2008  8:50AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Gamers' Wives, the way for people to have sex was to leave the room together for two minutes                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_168963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168963/#Comment_168963" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-14T09:46:11+00:00" title="September 14, 2008  9:46AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 14, 2008 9:46AM by TomasHVM.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sex, yes, I do not play much on sex in my games.
