This is an innovative, cutting-edge game and I had almost no feedback to give (in the good way).<br/><br/>First, a precis of the game. 1KK (Maybe I have coined the SotCization of this game right here and now) is a game where you play yourself. Not a version of yourself, not a fictionalized self. It's you. The guy or girl who's sitting at the table. Fiction starts where the virtual-you gets up from the table and walks through a door visible to the real you, and walks through it into a fantasy world. One of the players stays behind, holding the door open, and tells the others what happens.<br/><br/>Your stats are based on your own recollections of yourself, and that of others. For example, Ben said, "Rob, I remember when we played Misspent Youth at Dreamation and there were really serious problems and you didn't get defensive, and you were smiling at the end of some pretty heavy criticism. That's how I know you're Strong." Bang, I get a dot of Strong. The stats are Strong, Brave, Kind, Sharp, and Beautiful. Each person may only ever give you two rememberences, and you may never start the game over with a new character. You can't be a new you, you are always you. You may also give yourself a single rememberence, once ever.<br/><br/>This memory thing carries into the game too. Let's say I need some extra dice for fighting the carnivorous vegetable. You can say, "I remember the first time when I saw this really ugly vegetable and I was grossed out and didn't want to eat it, but I did, and it was delicious." I can then help you by saying, "I remember one time I was walking down the street and this dog jumped at me, and I freaked out until I realized, hey, I have hands, and I shut the gate and watched the dog bark fruitlessly." You now have two more dice. <br/><br/>This sharing stuff is the core of the game and since you can only ever get 2 permanent points from somebody, to advance your character you have to keep playing with new people.<br/><br/>The resolution works this way: 2d6, plus an appropriate stat # of dice, plus 1 or 2 dice for equipment, plus helping dice from yourself and other people. You roll your pool and so does the opposition. Set aside any 1s or 2s, and compare the highest die to the opposition. If you have higher dice, you win. If you are tied, you take the number of dice at that level (usually the number of sixes) and reroll. So does the opposition. Repeat until there are no longer any ties.<br/><br/>Whoever wins says what happens first, and takes all the 1s and 2s rolled on both sides to narrate what happens. That's a little too complicated to get into here.<br/><br/>Ok, next post is on to the fiction for this particular playtest.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73818/#Comment_73818" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-05T11:54:40+00:00" title="June  5, 2007 11:54AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played with Emily Care Boss, Alexis (don't know her last name; Ben's girlfriend), Eppy, and Ben Lehman held the door open for us. We wound up fighting against the ravages of the Empty-Heart Vegetable army--carnivorous man-sized zucchini-like plants that, if you ate them, would leave you unable to ever love again--against the Garden Kingdom. We got them steamed, then sprinkled spices on them to make them tasty to one another, then made them cannibalize one another. We also had Emily talking her way into the palace of the Sage King and coming out with a brain busting full of knowledge, and me trying to broker a peace between the Ravens and Eagles on behalf of the Gull King, and getting the Sea King stuck in the middle of it.<br/><br/>Highlights: When you get into the game you can pick either an Artifact, which gives you +4 dice whenever it's relevant, or an Excellency, which is a super-power that gives you a permanent +3 to one trait. I chose to be able to create out of my imagination anything that was impossible in the real world.<br/><br/>So we're getting all angsty about what to do about the EHV gang. I suggest we lure them with meat, but we're playing with a vegan who doesn't want to do that (but is okay with the EHVs killing each other--in fact suggests the cannibalization later <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>). So I make a chicken-leg tree. Everyone freaks the fuck out, which I always love.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73819/#Comment_73819" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-05T11:56:50+00:00" title="June  5, 2007 11:56AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as feedback:<br/><br/>Players in cooperation dominate.

I'm not convinced that they're as powerful as all that, because the odds of the die mechanic mean that the threats will always win sometimes but maybe they won't win enough... I have to think on that.<br/><br/>I'm really glad our play went so well!

When I sat down to play, Rob was the only person there I had met before that day, and I only barely knew him. In no time, I felt a kinship to everyone at the table. It wasn't just because we had to share random tales from our lives, but because the memories we were sharing were all tied together through common themes reflected in the conflicts we were having in the Land of a Thousand Kings.<br/><br/>And of course the fact that character creation is based on complements didn't hurt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73836/#Comment_73836" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-05T12:30:10+00:00" title="June  5, 2007 12:30PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your vegan conscious is sad because you destroyed vegetables?
