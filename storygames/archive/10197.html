This of course assumes that type of game, but given that type it's a pretty good explanation. Saving throws were thrown in as a second chance to survive when you were already supposed to be dead, but it rather sucks having them tied to character level.<br/><br/>So instead, have a single universal stat that has a saving throw attached to it: Karma (or whatever, but it's a suitable choice). Depending on how you roleplay your character, it goes up and down. Increases would come from stuff like giving enemies a proper burial, or at least not looting them (unless they've got something that's clearly not theirs, such as a legendary sword), being generally selfless, rushing in to save innocent people (making you more at risk of dying), giving up treasure that's acquired instead of hoarding it, etc. Doing the opposite would cause it to drop. Having an interesting character makes it go up too, and having a boring or dull character would have it go down. Any time your character would die (either by being hacked to death, falling down a chasm, or being poisened, or anything else) you can roll against your Karma (roll under percentile would work nicely), and if you make it you get plot immunity from dying. Your liver fights off the poison, the felling blow just knocked you out rather than hitting a vital and killing you, and you managed to grab on to something while falling. <br/><br/>I figure it could be attached to most systems, like for instance ORE could have it where you get dice in Karma, and if you get a set, you survive.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226503/#Comment_226503" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-21T09:24:34+00:00" title="August 21, 2009  9:24AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hindu Karma is different than Buddhist Karma.

Perhaps if you do enough bad things, then your karma grows (negatively) as well? The world keeps you alive to perpetuate more evil?

What I was thinking of was if you have a well developed character that you've invested time into, it's much harder to die. However, if your character is a jackass, then you get less plot immunity from death, since it's somewhat more appropriate to die. I'd be reluctant to have bad karma grow, since that gives players an opportunity to be jackasses and then not die as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226531/#Comment_226531" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-21T11:08:32+00:00" title="August 21, 2009 11:08AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could also make it a Key-related, character determined thing.

It could be sorta like how some games use refresh scenes to do character development and provide a mechanical bonus.
