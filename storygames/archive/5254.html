It's total war, and things got off on the wrong foot for the Polish resistance.  But if you can't free Warsaw, you sure as hell can free Krolewska street - at least long enough to find out if Hanina Z\u0142ota totally has a crush on you or not.  And why wouldn't she?  You're 15, you've got a wispy moustache, and you're the only kid on the block with a rifle.  Time to make it happen, tiger - before the Germans return in force and, well, do their best to murder you.  Challenging, GM-less roleplaying for mature people like you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118476/#Comment_118476" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-08T09:16:46+00:00" title="January  8, 2008  9:16AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Jason!<br/><br/>I'm running three games, all of which are incredible.<br/><br/>The first! Questers of the Middle Realms, in an adventure called "Ko-Sha on Ice!" Why should you play it? It's fun, light-hearted urban fantasy in a city besieged by an ice storm, full of double-crossing. It's an IPR game that doesn't get enough love. It's not going to have anything in it that will scar you. It will have redeeming endings and laughter and good times, and also swords and magic and thieves and snow. It's on Friday at 9am.<br/><br/>The second! Swansong, "Winter of 1424." I've combined another not-loved-enough game and bad, bad pseudo-history. Play the Muslim Chinese eunuch Admiral Zheng He and his crew on their treasure ships, discovering the New World! See frozen Alaska! Live in "the shadow of the Prince of Darkness!" This will be much more of a bloody sea-faring opera. It will soar with deceit and stabbing. It's on Saturday at 9am.<br/><br/>Lastly! "Heroes of the Land" is the adventure name - the system is kind of secret. It's not my system. It's Vincent Baker's, and you have never played it, but it's not new. All the clues are there for you to follow. You want to play it because you're intrigued, and you also love fantasy role-playing with swords and hitting things and elves and whatnot. You do not want to play it if you're some sort of pervy gamer snob. You will have stats and hit bonuses. It's on Saturday at 8pm.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118481/#Comment_118481" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-08T09:25:32+00:00" title="January  8, 2008  9:25AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm running my game-in-development, <a href="http://mastermines.wordpress.com/projects/misspent-youth/" rel="nofollow">Misspent Youth</a>. That link directs you to many posts and some early game outline documents. I'll paste the main paragraph from that site to give you an idea what it's about. If anyone has any questions, please do ask.<br/><br/>Misspent Youth is about friendship, the fight for freedom, and being awesome. My Fred-Hicks-style Hollywood Pitch is: In Snow Crash\u2019s future, Danny Ocean\u2019s crew\u2013Goonies-sized\u2013play craps to take down Big Brother. It\u2019s a sci-fi game about 12 to 17 year olds in a future about ten years from now. The players create a villain together, then create their Youthful Offenders to tap into that. All conflicts are group conflicts and it is not possible to mechanically act against members of your crew. You can fight with them, you can even have an in-group argument touch dice, but if you do the Authority player plays the part of the strife in your relationship.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118482/#Comment_118482" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-08T09:31:33+00:00" title="January  8, 2008  9:31AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clinton R.

This game is a showcase for jeepform techniques, using flashbacks and flashforwards, bird in the ear and other tricks to get the players to tell the story of these characters' struggles with love and betrayal.

From the writeup: Create a world and its futuristic challenges in the tradition of Ursula LeGuin, Philip K. Dick, and Bruce Sterling.

Guys, that was really fun. Jason, I wish you'd been there, but logistically speaking, I'm glad you weren't. The game really works best with only four players, and as a result, I'm restricting the number of people who can sign up to three. Get it while it's hot! Or sign up to run another session of it!</p>\n<p>I'm also playtesting Beowulf, which uses the system from In a Wicked Age to tell stories of blood and steel in the snow. Hew limbs! Brag yourself silly! Flex your muscles and bare your fangs! Find out if maybe heroes aren't very good people to have around! In a Wicked Age is a really neat system for this because it gives you real monster-playing capabilities. Your monster might be a perennial character, or maybe you're just there to eat Danes for a session.

For even more information go to the relevant post at <a href="http://stone-baby.com/?p=32" rel="nofollow">Stone Baby Games</a>:<br/><b><br/>Thursday, 8 PM: \u201cIn Memory of Octavia Butler\u201d</b><br/><br/><i>This session of Steal Away Jordan is inspired by Octavia\u2019s Bulter\u2019s Kindred. At least one PC will be a modern day person who wakes up on a Tennessee cotton plantation in 1820, where she is assumed to be a new slave. How will you integrate yourself? How do the other slaves react to your mysterious arrival and odd manners? If you never escape this time period, how will you make your way in your new environment?<br/></i><br/>This game will be serious, but fun, and I\u2019m rating it R for sex and violence. Before we play, we\u2019ll establish our boundaries on race issues, language, where the veils are, etc. We\u2019ll explore some really dark themes, but each participant will be responsible for maintaining a safe environment for all to explore.<br/><b><br/>Friday 9 AM: An Antebellum Ghost Story</b><br/><br/><i>1850, Olive Branch Mississippi, the Tubbs Plantation. Master Beauregard Tubbs has died under mysterious circumstances, and his three sons have come to divide the assets of the plantation, including the slaves. But there\u2019s strangeness afoot: apparitions, big black dogs with blazing eyes, black cats, and a pretty young slave who collects graveyard dirt. The players, all slaves, are in the middle of it. Who is your enemy? Who is your ally? Who is the smooth talking man standing in the crossroads?<br/></i><br/>I love playing the folk tale! This one\u2019s for those who want fantasy in their slave narratives. This will be super fun, and probably pretty silly, all ages welcome. Start your Friday with some down home creepiness.<br/><br/><b>Friday, 2 PM: Congo Square, New Orleans, 1800</b><br/><i><br/>On Sundays in New Orleans, slaves and free people of color congregated, largely unsupervised, on Congo Square. They met friends, family, and lovers. Slaves often performed alleged Vodou and African rituals for the curious spectators. They danced, drummed, bartered, and occasionally planned to escape. Life for city slaves was difficult, but not as rough as their plantation counterparts. Freedom of movement allowed permitted slaves the oppurtunity to escape, but is it worth it if you have to travel through bayous and swamps to get anywhere safe?</i><br/><br/>This game will explore the lives of slaves when their masters are not around. Most interactions will be between other slaves and free people of color, but don\u2019t worry, as a slave your life is intricately entwined with your subjugators. They won\u2019t just be in the shadows. I\u2019m hoping for rebellions, escapes, and love against all odds.<br/><br/>Another serious, but fun game. This one is rated PG.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118828/#Comment_118828" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-09T12:01:24+00:00" title="January  9, 2008 12:01PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All midnight slots feature me running <i>Escape or Die!</i><br/><br/>It gives you the real adrenal response of watching a tense "escape" movie (ala Aliens, etc)!<br/><br/>It lets you get to bed well before 4am!<br/><br/>You can go anywhere from crazy gonzo to tensely thought-provoking!

My uncle, he was out exploring the ruins of Oil Bluff; that town was lost to the machines a few generations back, you can see it if you stand on the bakehouse roof. Well, he was out exploring the ruins of Oil bluff when they came a hunting. They knew he was up there. 'Hadn't been a man walking around those parts for more than a decade, I'm sure, but as soon as one showed up the machines knew. You could see the lightning from here, lit up the whole night sky.

You'll find two sessions of the heist and caper movie role-playing game Criminal Element (created by yours truly), as well as a session of Seth Ben-Ezra's brilliant Dirty Secrets.  Write-ups for both games are as follows:<br/><br/><b>Friday @ 8.00 PM and Saturday @ 8.00 PM<br/>Criminal Element</b><br/>"The score on this heist...  The score is worth the heat it could bring.  It's worth breaking through security systems, racing down city streets, or shooting down anyone that gets in our way.  It's worth the time we could do, or the bullets we could take.  <br/><br/>It's worth all of that because we're criminals and this is what we do.  We take scores."<br/><br/>Play Criminal Element, the Caper and Heist move role-playing game.  Inspired by films such as Heat, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, and Reservoir Dogs.  Together at the table we'll create the perfect heist, from the crooks running the job to the plan itself, and then put into bloody action. <br/><br/><b>Why You Need To Play This Game</b><br/>Have you ever liked a heist movie?  Heat, Reservoir Dogs, the Sting, Ocean's 11, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Killing Zoe, Sexy Beast... God, I can go on and on.  Well, if you did then you need to play this game.  Create your own heist.  Lay out the plans with the other players, from what your stealing to the opposition that gets in your way.  Bet on your actions and get rewarded.  Betray your fellow PCs and watch as the system turns the heat up.  <br/><br/>By the way, a very big "thank you" to Judd for helping me write that copy about a year ago when I was going to run the game at the last Dreamation.  <br/><br/><b>Saturday @ Midnight<br/>Dirty Secrets "To Live and Die In..."</b><br/>You thought you were done.  You thought you just had to get through this last night and then you were going to leave and head back to the normal, workaday world.  You were wrong.  A crime has been committed, one so terrible that you have to investigate, that you have to know why.  And it doesn't matter how many other horrible secrets you uncover along the way. <br/><br/>Dirty Secrets, the game of deception, betrayal, corruption, and murder, all set in the Here and Now.  As a group, we will guide a single investigator through a complex web of lies toward that most elusive prey: the Truth.<br/><br/><b>Why You Need To Play This Game</b><br/>This game is beautiful.  It's a mystery game inspired by the likes of Hamnett and Chandler.  One player takes on the role of Investigator while the rest of us work together on creating an intriguing web of lies and criminality, all leading up to the revelation of "who done it".  And this is the really cool part: we as players don't actually know who the culprit is.  Only through game play will the game itself reveal the perpetrator of the crime.  Help create an engrossing mystery that will leave both the Investigator and us as players guessing until the very end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119190/#Comment_119190" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-11T23:00:02+00:00" title="January 11, 2008 11:00PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Friday at 8 pm...<br/><br/><b>Ganakagok: The Edge of the Ice</b><br/><br/>An invocation:<br/><br/><i>Forever have the People lived in starlight cold;<br/>But now we gather, and soon ascend<br/>And go together to world's end.</i><br/><br/><i>Ganakagok</i> is a game where you play a hunter, warrior, or shaman of the People, who live on a vast, frozen icescape in a world of eternal night.<br/><br/>But the dawn is coming -- coming soon.<br/><br/>What will the rising of the Sun mean to a people who have always revered the Stars?<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>The rules of <i>Ganakagok</i> rely on an oracular tarot to guide the development of the in-game situation and the consequences of character action.

It was one of the games up at the Ashcan Front, and I've revised it a lot from the feedback I received.  It's a gritty urban fantasy about people living on the streets who've lost everything they owned, including their memories and identity.  Each character has to work their way out of their own psychological labyrinth while fighting their personal demons manifested as monsters.  Think Dark City meets the Fisher King in the setting of Neverwhere. <br/>\n<br/>\nCharacter histories are created in a round robin collaboration by the other players at the table, and are revealed through play.  The more the character (and player) learn about who they were in their past life, the more strength they have to struggle their way out of the cracks and out of the fantasy world they're trapped in.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm running the game on Thursday @ Midnight, Friday 2pm, and Saturday 9am                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thelostgm" title="thelostgm"><img alt="thelostgm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thelostgm">thelostgm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119317/#Comment_119317" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-13T13:04:14+00:00" title="January 13, 2008  1:04PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><a href="http://www.sonsofkryos.com/giantsrpg.html" rel="nofollow">Giants</a>, Saturday at 2:00 PM</b><br/><br/>From the Biblical Goliath to John Henry and his hammer, to Norse Giants in their cold home of Jotunheim -- stories of their great strength, ravenous hungers, and magical gifts--are found in all cultures and throughout history.<br/><br/>Create your own Giant and the Community it protects and is supported by. Fill the world map with marvels that will draw your Giants on quests of adventure and hunger. <br/><br/>Will your Giants build a new age of glory or stomp civilization into rubble to feed the hunger which drives and empowers them?<br/><br/>In this session players will pick from several pre-made characters.<br/>-The Maw, a Giant made entirely of mouths.<br/>-Remnant, a Giant of the forest made of moss.<br/>-Father Bite, a gigantic one-eyed dinosaur who has endured since the world's earliest days.<br/>-Delphina, a sea Giant.<br/>-Fe Fi Fo Fum III, a mechanical Giant.  <br/>-The Wolf Lord, a Giant dire wolf.<br/><br/>Players will also create the world map, and come up with the group threat that drives the game.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I only got my act together enough to run one game of Giants on the books.  But hey, I'd be more than happy to run some off the record.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120432/#Comment_120432" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-18T12:46:06+00:00" title="January 18, 2008 12:46PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to run at least one session of Misspent Youth where the Youthful Offenders are a petty criminal gang focused mostly on property crime, and the Authority is a masked vigilante who's secretly an old-money multibillioniare white guy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
