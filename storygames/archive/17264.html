The gamer girl population increases every year. In many avenues, females can actually outnumber males. While this is good news, the bad news is how little this is actually changing the games themselves. At a BlizzCon panel discussion an female querist was booed for suggesting that maybe the female characters should be able to wear clothes. <br/><br/>But the problem goes way deeper than that. Even within RPGs where female gamers are not only accepted but delightfully encouraged, the roles they prefer are often within healer, support, or diplomatic archetypes (again, major generalization, but largely true nonetheless). Wish fulfillment seems to be the more desired form of escapism as opposed to power fantasy or strategic simulation.<br/><br/>Tabletop gaming's roots are wargames, and this continues to form the foundations of almost all mainstream RPGs. The point is ultimately combat, no matter how many peripheral rules and options exist within the particular game system. And at the end of the day, many women just aren't interesting in killing things and taking their stuff.<br/><br/>Assuming you accept my premise (and I know that's a big if), this should be informing game design, but it isn't. With the notable exception of Nobilis, even games with female contributors ultimately seem to be about fighting. Beyond the wargame roots, the other obvious explanation is that combat is the most easy and obvious form of conflict, and it's hard to build any kind of play that doesn't revolve around conflict. <br/><br/>The video game world started to figure this out, and we got the Sims, a fantastic series of games (It is; deal with it) that is also more popular than the Bible. A Second Life is still in existence, largely due to its popularity among female gamers. <br/><br/>I also believe the popularity of Game of Thrones lies in its evolution from the Tokienesque war of good vs. evil toward a focus on individual characters striving toward deeply personal goals.<br/><br/>The question is this: If the bedrock of tabletop RPGs were not male-centric wargames, but rather a different female-centric or androgynous premise, how would it look different? How should this change in thinking change the way we're designing games?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391411/#Comment_391411" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-26T08:30:18+00:00" title="September 26, 2012  8:30AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Check out Emily Care Boss's three short games about the human heart: Breaking the Ice, Shooting the Moon, and Under My Skin.

In my current <i>Dungeon World</i> campaign, the only female player plays a Druid. She typically morphs into various animals -- whichever will be the most useful in the given situation (squirrel or sparrow for scouting, bear for combat, etc.). The bear was by far the most memorable. Heads were ripped off.<br/><br/>In the last game of <i>Dread</i> I played, my wife portrayed a lecherous corporate schmuck who was handy with firearms. While the rest of the guys around the table were trying to evade the menace or back-stab each other, her character was chasing tail and shooting anyone who got in his way.<br/><br/>That last example may be a tad gonzo, but the point is, she had a grand time inciting violence and delving into the more reprehensible stereotypes of rich men (to paraphrase her post-session assessment).<br/><br/>Perhaps I don't play enough 'mainstream' RPGs to see where you're coming from.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jacob" title="Jacob"><img alt="Jacob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jacob">Jacob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391415/#Comment_391415" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-26T08:50:04+00:00" title="September 26, 2012  8:50AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Monsterhearts is another good example or a game that has evolved far outside the war-game vein; there is /violence/, but not /combat/. It also handles emotion and melodrama VERY well. And it appeals to a bunch of fringe-gamer and even non-gamer women I know.<br/><br/>Typically it's methodical step-by-step combat that turns off the women gamers I know, not the violence itself. When it comes time to get dirty/bloody the female gamers I know are willing to go to levels the guys are sometimes surprised at. Honestly the step-by-step combat thing turns off a lot of new-to-the-hobby guys too; it's really the people who grew up with it that seem to like it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391418/#Comment_391418" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-26T09:01:00+00:00" title="September 26, 2012  9:01AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anecdote time!<br/><br/>My girlfriend hates "story games bullshit" where we "talk about feelings" and would rather move her dragonborn barbarian 5 squares at a time towards the bloodiest, most granular rules-heavy combat she can find.<br/><br/>Non-ladies should not assume what all ladies like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391421/#Comment_391421" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-26T09:17:42+00:00" title="September 26, 2012  9:17AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps it's actually the fact that it's easier to assume a bunch of generic stuff about men and still being right (like we all want a good combat, complex rules, strategy, etc) than to assume a few things about women and start designing from there.

More games that are available that satisfy more diverse interests results in more diverse demographics becoming involved which results in more market available for more diverse games.<br/><br/>Yes, the biggest hitters with the highest production values (and therefore the highest production costs and the need for the broadest market appeal) will target the primary demographics more.<br/><br/>But the long-tail market will continue to grow as long as niche demographics continue to be able to find suitable niche products.

As a designer you don`t use stereotypes, but you need to make a few assumptions to focus your design. Of course, this has nothing to do with prejudice.<br/>The assumptions I make when designing go more about the kind of things the players will do with the material I'm designing, and what I should and shouldn't include to make their experience more enjoyable.<br/><br/>Perhaps mease19 approach would work better in this case. Let's listen other players and form an opinion of what they want, regardless of what we think players from different sex may want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin" title="Chris_Goodwin"><img alt="Chris_Goodwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/104/nWRZN6AU4P4W8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin">Chris_Goodwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391431/#Comment_391431" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-26T09:58:11+00:00" title="September 26, 2012  9:58AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2012 9:59AM by Chris_Goodwin.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a member of one gender, I know the things I personally prefer in gaming (which may in fact change from day to day, and have done so).

Diversity of subject matter is pretty important.<br/><br/>Also, I'd suggest considering the issues people will have when trying to tell stories in your setting. For me, if I sit down to a combat-heavy, D&amp;D-style game, it's easier to come up with male characters by using the stories I have read that fit well with the expected behavior of our characters (re: LotR, most European myths, etc). Sure, I can just switch the gender, but often people start saying that she doesn't really feel "female" to them. I also run into people trying to enforce their limited view of world history. It's frustrating. Not every group has this problem, and not every person playing female characters gets as frustrated as I do, but it's one thing to keep in mind.<br/><br/>Now if we switch the focus to something that tends to be more female-dominated, such as the homefront during a foreign war (see US during WWI and WWII) or a domestic war but not on the frontline (see US Revolutionary War or Vietnam), we have many more story options to pull from.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391434/#Comment_391434" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-26T10:14:04+00:00" title="September 26, 2012 10:14AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya, there's some interesting ideas in this thread. <br/><br/>The original question though was this:<br/>==========<br/>The question is this: If the bedrock of tabletop RPGs were not male-centric wargames, but rather a different female-centric or androgynous premise, how would it look different?

(Yes, that's an oversimplification - I'm not writing a 7 page Ron Edwards style essay on the subject.)<br/><br/>That movement lead to more games that do different things in play.<br/><br/>That lead to more people being able to find games that are a good fit for their interests. Including a closer to even percentage of women than was previously represented in the hobby.<br/><br/>But also, gaming by women became more popularized in the video game market as well, which enhanced the number of women willing to look at RPGs as a potential activity and reducing the social barriers.<br/><br/>And, as I said before, more diversity in audience leads to more diverse product production in a reduced production cost environment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391436/#Comment_391436" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-26T10:24:12+00:00" title="September 26, 2012 10:24AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, let me wreck this whole thread. (rubs fingernails on lapels, cracks knuckles)<br/><br/>The main issue with these kinds of discussions is that in RPGs there is no central organization which can make systemic changes (other than D&amp;D Organized Play, more on which in a minute.) So let me quickly talk about chess.<br/><br/>I was involved in competitive chess in the late 1980s and early 1990s. I was a bad chessplayer but I loved it, and I ended up the most organized guy in my college chess club, so I was President. This meant I organized some tournaments, and got to interact with all kinds of other tournament organizers, pro chessplayers and officials. In the US, the US Chess Federation was and is the premiere organization for competitive chess.<br/><br/>Everyone recognized that in the 60s and 70s the game had a huge problem with horrible, misogynist environments at chess tournaments, and outright hostility towards female chessplayers from the bottom of the hobby world to the top of the competitive world.  There were trailblazing, brilliant women who pushed their way in, but overall it was just a very ugly situation. In the late 70s, the outcry became too much and chess organizations started to open their doors and shut down sexist actions at tournaments. Codes of conduct, etc.  Yet when I came around, competitive chess at your typical local tournament was still around 80-90 percent men.<br/><br/>A lot of hand wringing ensued. "Why is it like this? We've opened our doors, it's not gross and unfair like in the old days!"  When I learned to post on Usenet in college, this was what was heard. (Maybe something really IS wrong with their ladybrains, concluded many morons.)  So the USCF decided to go further and entered partnerships with the Girl Scouts and other women youth organizations to teach chess, to organize chess tournaments specifically for them, and to actively seek out and promote women in chess.  You would have thought they proposed abolishing the rook.  The screams and howls of people saying that this was discriminatory, that this was unfair to men, etc. were amazing.  This is the first time I knew that "reverse discrimination" was bullshit - and ever since that time I have always remembered that. ("Did he just say 'reverse discrimination'? Okay. I remember that.  That's bullshit.")<br/><br/>By the time I left competitive chess (after college, like a lot of people), I was still a shit chessplayer, but the stats were coming in and the USCF had doubled, in a very short amount of time, the number of women players in competitive tournaments, even in regular old local tournaments.  Doubled.<br/><br/>So start from this position: you're in a hobby dominated by white dudes.  How does this change? It changes with <i>actively seeking out</i> women to join the hobby, not just making sure that the hobby isn't gross and horrible to them.  Women are capable of pursuing their interests just fine, but nobody, women or men, will slog through a horrorshow of harassment, rape threats, and garbage just for some leisure pretendy funtime.<br/><br/>Now let's look at the RPG hobby itself. In America, the majority of roleplayers start by playing The Current Edition Of D&amp;D and never play any other game unless it's The Next Edition Of D&amp;D.  If they end up not liking D&amp;D (anymore) then they don't find another game, they leave the hobby.  This means that the key element, the gatekeeper of the hobby is organized play of D&amp;D.  This puts the RPGA in the position of the USCF in my earlier story.  <br/><br/>Thus I reach the conclusion: if you want more RPGs that "appeal to women", then you need more women RPG designers and players, and if you want more women to design RPGs, you need more women to play RPGs, and overwhelmingly, in America, that means you need them to play D&amp;D.  (There was a time when you could substitute a White Wolf LARP for the RPGA, but that time's past.)<br/><br/>This is all as prologue to my suggestion: organize an RPGA chapter and do active outreach with your community's women's organizations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TaoJeannes" title="TaoJeannes"><img alt="TaoJeannes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TaoJeannes">TaoJeannes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391437/#Comment_391437" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-26T10:24:54+00:00" title="September 26, 2012 10:24AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2012 10:34AM by TaoJeannes.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Non-ladies should not assume what all ladies like.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><br/><i>(Usual disclaimer about these only being generalizations and there are many exceptions, blah blah blah)</i></blockquote>\nKeep in mind I'm not asking how to make a "girl game".

Lets look at the roleplaying game "markets" or game cultures that got a 50/50 gender mix. Like Larping in the Nordic countries. Hence, my example of Nordic larp.

There are men who are willing to attend a knitting circle, but they are also the exception.)<br/><br/>And at the design level, having more women involved in the design process is more likely to produce more content that will appeal to more women. Likewise, having more women who write and edit books increases the number of books that more women are interested in reading. (Again, this is not to say that there's never been a woman who was interested in reading books mostly by male authors/editors, just that having a heavily male-dominated production process reduces the aggregate appeal of the output.)\n<blockquote>and if you want more women to design RPGs, you need more women to play RPGs,</blockquote>\nSure. The overwhelming majority of designers are regular players, so this follows.\n<blockquote>and overwhelmingly, in America, that means you need them to play D&amp;D.  (There was a time when you could substitute a White Wolf LARP for the RPGA, but that time's past.)<br/><br/>This is all as prologue to my suggestion: organize an RPGA chapter and do active outreach with your community's women's organizations.</blockquote>\nThis is the part of the logic chain that I don't think follows.<br/><br/>To look at a parallel market for comparison - computer games.<br/><br/>In the 1980s and early 1990s, the primary market for computer games was the same as the primary market for RPGs - teen to young adult males, mostly non-minority ones.<br/><br/>In early stages, production costs were prohibitively high. Building and delivering a game presented a huge cost risk.<br/><br/>By the mid-to-late 1990s, core production costs lowered. Electronic distribution began to become viable. Free or cheap core gaming engines were produced that people could build on top of.<br/><br/>Also, the types of games being produced became wider and wider. Sure, you had male-oriented games like Street Fighter and gun games. But you also had more abstract games like Tetris that were pretty androgynous. Games like that tended to attract a less male-heavy fanbase.<br/><br/>The combination of reduced production costs and a widening audience lead to an increased diversity in offerings. Which was self-reinforcing - more games appealing to women created more women games and more women game producers and more games appealing to women.<br/><br/>Sure, in the current marketplace, you still see examples of male-centric development and marketing. And you see examples of misogynist gamer community, as the OP mentioned.<br/><br/>But you also see lots and lots of counterexamples.<br/><br/>In order to introduce women into computer games, you don't have to introduce them to Battlefield 3 or make them play a scantily clad elf in WoW. Just because those games are the biggest and most popular doesn't mean you have to play them in order to say you enjoy playing video games.<br/><br/>Maybe they'll get interested in Harvest Moon or Bejeweled or Mass Effect. Or maybe some weird little indie game like Limbo will capture their imagination. I know a lot of young women who cut their teeth on rhythm games - Dance Dance Revolution and Guitar Hero and such. <br/><br/>For my wife, the only computer games she likes are Bejeweled-style puzzlers and the occasional pixel hunt adventure game like Monkey Island. Nothing else holds appeal. But that's fine, cause there's bunches of puzzlers and pixel hunt games available for those rare times that she wants to play a computer game.<br/><br/>I agree that outreach is helpful if you want to even the ratios more (and in my experience, ratios are already coming much much closer to even, which is awesome).<br/><br/>But I don't agree that that outreach needs to be D&amp;D-flavored in order to work.<br/><br/>If you want to get more women playing RPGs, I think filling your gaming bag with Monsterhearts, Fiasco, Sorcerer, Trollbabe, Laser Ponies and Dungeon World is going to be way more effective. <br/><br/>Plus, you can carry all 6 of those games around with less strain on your shoulders than just the core D&amp;D books would cause, so there's a bonus.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391459/#Comment_391459" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-26T12:02:54+00:00" title="September 26, 2012 12:02PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2012 12:06PM by Felan.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Those andogynic gender premises exists.

To use a video game example, consider the split between "hardcore" and "casual" games. These distinctions are ridiculously simplistic (lots of women like FPS games, lots of men like Bejewelled) and serve only to perpetuate inequalities. In my opinion, changing design practices and better representation, while important, are only meaningful in conjunction with people involved in gaming need to step up and actively re-making gaming culture as a social context that isn't utterly toxic for people who aren't white men.<br/><br/>EDIT: Also, "getting more women into gaming" really means getting more <i>novices</i> into gaming.

Or just not enough?<br/><br/>Personally, I think that as the audiences diversify on multiple vectors, which I seem to see them doing in my limited experience, that some of this happens on it's own. Sure, there are disgraceful counterexamples of reactivity, but that happens in nearly all cultural shifts.<br/><br/>There's a lot of people at my local convention that aren't white males. And the proportion seems to be growing. Sure, it's not representative of the nation/state/county/city/whatever as a whole. But it seems to be diverse enough that I don't think it counts as toxic.<br/><br/>When I first started larping, the male/female ratios were pretty far off. So if you had a cute young unattached female attend a game, she'd get waaaaaay too much attention from the seething geeky males. Eventually the ratios improved enough that things got more comfortable. Seems pretty reasonable these days. For a couple of reasons. One - there's more than one unattached attractive female present at a time, so the attention gets spread around. Two - the overall player base has a higher percentage of older players around who set a good example of good conduct and help discourage poor behavior. Like if a group of young guys is having a locker room style conversation that is getting rude and disrespectful, there are more people around likely to call them on it.<br/><br/>Not that attractive females never get excessive attention, but it no longer stands out as being worse how it would be in any other mixed social situation.\n<blockquote>EDIT: Also, "getting more women into gaming" really means getting more <i>novices</i> into gaming. When we talk about "women" not being into certain kinds of games, or having trouble with certain systems, we're actually talking about people who don't have a lot of experience with games - not some sort of inherent female characteristic. So, again, making gaming culture open and safe for people who aren't "in on it" is the most productive thing we can do.</blockquote>\nThis is true only insomuch as you accept the notion that widespread cultural adoption and acceptance is inherently good.<br/><br/>I'm not sure that's always the case. The acceptance of TV and movies as a form of entertainment is nearly universal. And the result is a hell of a lot of bad TV and movies being produced. <br/><br/>Musicals are the most popular and, in general, the least fascinating and provocative form of live spoken word theatre (and if you count live stand-up comedy shows in the same category as the second most popular form, which I think is pretty accurate, that just reinforces what I'm saying).<br/><br/>Personally I'm more interested in improving the quality of games and gaming experiences, rather than purely increasing the quantity. I'm not selling games, so having more people who play them with each other doesn't benefit me.<br/><br/>Having a more diverse crowd of people interested in playing - more women, more gays, more non-whites, more old people, more kids - those things benefit me. When I play an RPG at a convention and the other people at the table are not all white dudes in the same age range as me, that changes my play experience.<br/><br/>The fact that more people are at the convention as a whole only affects my experience a little. Maybe it means there will be a few more games on the menu that aren't D&amp;D or GURPS, so that helps a little. <br/><br/>The fact that overall in the hobby there are more people makes it a little more likely that an event like Nerdly Beach Party exists. But it doesn't do it by itself. It takes the development of effective sub-communities to make that happen. And just growing the overall hobby play base does little to develop those sub-communities unless that is where the growth is happening.<br/><br/>In other words, improving quality and sharing those improvements will do plenty to make quantity happen. Improving quantity by itself just means you end up with more crap.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391475/#Comment_391475" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-26T13:33:49+00:00" title="September 26, 2012  1:33PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I wonder what an RPG event would look like for eight or ten girls that age.</blockquote>\nI've done a bit of that.  In 2007 I ran <a href="http://jhkimrpg.livejournal.com/59156.html" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D</a> for an 11-year-old girl's birthday party; and then in 2009 I ran a <a href="http://jhkimrpg.livejournal.com/75807.html" rel="nofollow">outdoor fantasy larp</a> for her 13th birthday.  They all got into it, though I don't know if most of them continued to be interested in RPGs (the birthday girl did).  <br/><br/>As for the alternate history, I think the example of Harry Potter is a good one.  There would have to be a hook for RPGs more specific than general gender.  (By parallel, boys are often into sports, but popular boys sports never appear in mainstream RPGs.)  In the 1970s, Star Trek fans (although not sci-fi fans in general) were often female - perhaps predominantly so.  That might be a possible basis - though I'm not sure what it would look like other than featuring Kirk/Spock romantic tension.  \n<blockquote>The indie RPG movement was started primarily by a group of guys (yes, guys) who wanted to look at how RPGs could be redesigned in ways that would focus more on how to construct stories and less on how to simulate tactical combat. <br/>....<br/>That lead to more people being able to find games that are a good fit for their interests. Including a closer to even percentage of women than was previously represented in the hobby.</blockquote>\nInteresting.  In my experience, the percentage of women in American indie RPG gatherings is roughly the same as for other tabletop RPGs - roughly 10-15%.  (This from gatherings like Nerdly Beach Party, Go Play NorthWest, or games-on-demand at GenCon Indy.)  Someone mentioned Nordic larp earlier - Knutepunkt does have a higher percentage of women but still a minority, around 30-35% by my estimation.

I havn't been to knutepunkt yet (planning to go next year) but in the latter example I was talking about larping in the Nordic countries in general. Not just the style called nordic larp. The Finnish larp scene has a female majority (I heared that it 70-60% females), Sweden has about 50% (60% female up north where I come from), Noway has 50/50 I think, and Denmark has a bit of a male majority.<br/><br/>So of we look at Nordic mainstream Larps we would also see a gaming culture form around a androgynous player base.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391482/#Comment_391482" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-26T14:01:24+00:00" title="September 26, 2012  2:01PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I enter this with great trepidation. but maybe i can contribute?<br/><br/>Everyone has their own sensibilities and sensitivities about stuff, in general it's important to respect how others feel. If you can be specific about what it is you do not like then there is probably a course of action that can be taken.<br/><br/>So for example, if a store has a bunch of posters promoting a game that use imagery you find offensive, talk to them about it. Maybe you can come to an agreement, maybe you will need to find a new place to play. you may also contact the publisher or have the store contact the publisher.<br/><br/>If players are being creepy then maybe post some rules for using the play space. respect and good sportsmanship are key and while moderating real people in a real physical space can be uncomfortable, that's life.<br/><br/>I realize this may involve some confrontation and takes tact to get results and that maybe unfair but it is necessary.<br/><br/>if your goal is to solve the problem a bit of tact will go a long long way, if your goal is to fight enemies the world contains an endless supply.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391494/#Comment_391494" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-26T15:40:28+00:00" title="September 26, 2012  3:40PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2012 3:41PM by Felan.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Do you think this is not happening at all? Or just not enough?</blockquote>\nI think it's not happening enough, particularly in the mainstream D&amp;D-dominated parts of the gaming world. But of course, we can and should highlight the many positive developments - not as evidence that the problem has been solved, but as exemplary cases to inspire further change.\n<blockquote>This is true only insomuch as you accept the notion that widespread cultural adoption and acceptance is inherently good.</blockquote>\nYou lost me from this point on - I'm not suggesting that gaming should be some kind of mass entertainment on the scale of popular film and TV, and I don't really see how it could be? That's neither here nor there. The point isn't to increase the number of people in the community, or to hit some sort of head-counting goal (50% women achieved! Success!) - the point is to make gaming a social space that isn't alienating and hurtful to women (and other marginalized people).<br/><br/>I was trying to point out that there is a common mistake made in popular discourse about women and gaming that conflates women with novices and genders novicehood as feminine. When we say "oh, this is a girl-friendly RPG/board game/video game" what we're actually saying is that it's a novice-friendly game. When we say women (or other marginalized people) are bad at games, what we're actually saying is that novices are bad at games (which is of course a tautology).<br/><br/><i>Part</i> of the way to make gaming culture more open and less hostile towards women (and other marginalized people) is to break down this conflation, instead of making condescending efforts to appeal to the specific stereotyped interests or tastes of those people. If we refuse to perpetuate the internal hierarchies of legitimate and illegitimate games, we can lower the barriers to entry into gaming for novices of all kinds, without alienating or marginalizing women who are already in the community, or who don't match up to the woman-as-novice stereotype.<br/><br/>And again, this happens largely outside of game design and the internal form and content of games. I'm not saying that stuff doesn't also matter, but it's meaningless without social change.<br/><br/>Does that make more sense?

The OP is using straightforward language - "The gamer girl population increases every year" - but we shouldn't jump on him for that. (I bet that, if the original post had been carefully phrased in terms of "gender balance", it wouldn't have attracted half the criticisms it did. We shouldn't jump on someone for not speaking the language.)<br/><br/>Secondly, there are real dangers in saying: this isn't really about women, it's about including people generally. You know this, right? It takes a problem about gender and removes the gender from it.<br/><br/>Thirdly, and to answer the original post, I think we should encourage and promote games by female designers. This probably means embracing games that fall outside our usual genre tropes. It means we might need to play <i>Steal Away Jordan</i>, <i>Breaking The Ice</i> and <i>Kagematsu</i> at conventions, rather than <i>Fiasco</i>, <i>Dungeon World</i> and <i>Marvel</i>.<br/><br/>There's a danger in trying to design "games that women like". So we mustn't go down that route. But we could try challenging some ideas that have been identified as patriarchal. We could explore changing identities. We could base characters around work that has historically been done by women. We could question the heroic narrative. And so on.<br/><br/>(This is what Joanna and I are trying to do in <i>The Tavern</i>. We're exploring ways of storytelling that incorporate fluid identities, work done by women, no heroes and so on.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391504/#Comment_391504" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-26T18:07:52+00:00" title="September 26, 2012  6:07PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I was trying to point out that there is a common mistake made in popular discourse about women and gaming that conflates women with novices and genders novicehood as feminine.</blockquote>\nAh. Thank you for restating what you meant. I understand more clearly now. Sorry for the long misguided tangent response.<br/><br/>I think what you are saying is only partially true, though.<br/><br/>A lot of structural stuff that is viewed as female-friendly is often novice-friendly, yes. Like simple unified mechanics, clean evocative character sheets, minimizing the amount of knowledge a player needs about the game in order to create an effective character, etc. And yeah, seeing making-it-easy-to-learn and calling it making-it-for-girls is pretty uncool. Though I think that when there are other barriers to entry for females, making a game easier to learn helps counteract some of those other barriers, maybe.<br/><br/>Some other stuff is viewed as female-friendly that has less to do with novices and more to do with perceived differences in interest. Having games that are less about making strategic battlemat moves in order to chop someone's head off thereby demonstrating a combination of character build optimization and sound tactical decision-making, compared to games about reading the relationship situation successfully in order to manipulate a character into doing what you want.<br/><br/>And I'm not saying that there aren't any guys interested in that manipulation stuff. And I'm not saying that there aren't any girls interested in the tactical combat stuff. But I think it's not purely coincidental that many players tell of anecdotal evidence of females being a little more interested in participating when there is a little less focus on strategy and competition and killing and a little more on story and relationships and such.<br/><br/>I know in the (mostly boffer) larps I participate in that there's been a marked increase in female participation at all levels (PCs, NPCs, coordinators, designers), though I don't have hard statistics. There were some women participating and organizing when I started larping 20 years ago, and there are a lot more now. Out of about 8 active and 2 recently concluded larp campaigns in the LA area, 5 of those 10 games are run by between 50% to 100% females. Interestingly, 2 of the 5 I currently count as being run by at least 50% females were games that were originally developed by a more male-heavy group but are now being maintained by a more female-heavy group as time has gone on.<br/><br/>Along with the increased participation by females has come an increased inclusion of more relationship/building/manipulating/crafting content. And also a decrease in complicated game mechanics and power build discussions (though they don't ever go away). Which caused which is chickens and eggs. But I think there is some level of correlation for both shifts. I think the games are better for all three reasons - more females present, more focus on story over combat, and more clean streamlined mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Fleming" title="James_Fleming"><img alt="James_Fleming" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Fleming">James_Fleming</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391532/#Comment_391532" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-27T04:04:50+00:00" title="September 27, 2012  4:04AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://wizards.com/dnd/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4dreye/20120502" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://wizards.com/dnd/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4dreye/20120502</a><br/>Is a decent article about Sexism within D&amp;D Art that I thought was kind of relevant, explores a lot of similar concepts to those in this thread.<br/><br/>I think the proportion of female gamers varies wildly depending on where they are drawing from.

Likewise, when I run games at gaming cons, I find that the player group is predominantly male, but at anime conventions, its not uncommon to run for all female groups. I think that is where the real key lies. Rather than looking at the question as 'How do we stop players of  feeling excluded?', ask 'Where are we getting these players of  currently?' and focusing avenues of publicity to widen those entry gates.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391538/#Comment_391538" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-27T05:41:06+00:00" title="September 27, 2012  5:41AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For myself and my interests, I would love if there were more women involved with the minis using side of things.<br/><br/>Yeah, yeah, I know that's a drum I beat a whole lot.<br/><br/>The thing is, the kinds of minis use and playstyle that I keep poking at design-wise is a whole lot closer to the kinds of toy play I associate with girls, than the kind that comes from the toy soldier wargame type play that young boys seem to love once they discover that it exists.<br/><br/>Really, I need to be able to pick the brains of people who played for hours with Barbie or their pony collection as children, not the folks whose idea of miniatures play is entirely wrapped up in what sort of bonus they get for sneaking up and outflanking the panzer hidden by the barn over there.<br/><br/>And that all kinda relates to some qualities that I do associate with female gamers (novice or experienced) more than male gamers.<br/><br/>For one thing, female gamers seem to be more talented with open play where it comes to secrets and <i>What-ifs </i>and <i>Let's Say ...</i> approaches to play. <br/><br/>All I mean by that is that women seem more capable of stepping out of character and putting forward some kind of revealing aside about their character or situation, and often that aside is more geared towards<i> here's something interesting that could happen and potentially go good or bad for the character</i> than attempt to gain some immediate advantage in the fiction.

I'm asking what male-centric decisions we're making in game design and how that would and should look differently if the number of female gamer designers were closer to 50% than 1%. <br/><br/>Let me try to give a bit more perspective. In the 80's Carol Gilligan wrote a book called "In a Different Voice" which was a case study of teenage girls. The study found that female psychology as it pertains to moral questions was so inherently different from their male counterparts that it was almost impossible to get meaningful answers to moral questions because the questions themselves were so male-centric. Time after time, girls tended to answer with "it depends" instead of speaking in moral absolutes. Gilligan derived a philosophy from that that society needs to change its thinking from its roots. More women becoming CEOs wouldn't solve the problem.<br/><br/>Likewise, more women at the gaming table doesn't solve the problem, because they're still playing games made - consciously or unconsciously - by men for men.

The male-centric decisions those designers are making are to not include women.  If you're looking for more specifics... get more women into your gaming groups, <del>design games</del>, play games with your group, find out what the people -- including women -- in your group like and don't like about the games you <del>design</del> play, and then change the things they don't like.  <br/><br/>The answer is to include more women.  Include more women.  Include more women.  We change our male-centric thinking by including more women.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TaoJeannes" title="TaoJeannes"><img alt="TaoJeannes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TaoJeannes">TaoJeannes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391566/#Comment_391566" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-27T10:16:20+00:00" title="September 27, 2012 10:16AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 27, 2012 10:20AM by TaoJeannes.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/3Jane">@3Jane</a> - You make incorrect assumptions about my assumptions. "We" means "we" and not "we men." It's not that I'm uninterested in interacting with women currently playing. I simply don't find player gender topical to what I'm really asking, since what I'm really asking is how game design could or should move from thinking that is inherently masculine minded to more games that are inherently feminine minded. It's based on the unprovable premise that there would be any difference at all. If you don't accept that premise, well that's understandable but it makes it hard for you to contribute to the conversation. <br/><br/>I believe Nobilis is inherently feminine minded, and I want more games like Nobilis.<br/><br/>What I'm really asking is this: What else are we missing out on? <br/><br/>I get how what I'm saying is really wonky, because I'm saying that most RPGs are inherently based on masculine thinking, thus making a gender distinction among designers while simultaneously saying that a gender distinction among the player base is irrelevant.<br/><br/>I think the examples offered of woman-designed games and inviting a comparison is really helpful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391571/#Comment_391571" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-27T10:52:02+00:00" title="September 27, 2012 10:52AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 27, 2012 10:54AM by RobMcDiarmid.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I believe Nobilis is inherently feminine minded, and I want more games like Nobilis.</blockquote>\nPerhaps breaking this down into more detail would help draw out more of the specifics you are looking for.<br/><br/>The easy question:<br/>What do you like about Nobilis?<br/><br/>The harder question:<br/>What is it about Nobilis that you find inherently feminine minded?<br/><br/>Best of luck answering the second without inviting backlash.

Likewise, more women at the gaming table doesn't solve the problem, because they're still playing games made - consciously or unconsciously - by men for men. How do we change our thinking?"<br/><br/>I assumed that masculine thinking is done by men. It blows my mind that you can have abstract definitions of 'feminine minded' that is divorced from what women around you actually think and like.\n<blockquote> It's based on the unprovable premise that there would be any difference at all. If you don't accept that premise, well that's understandable but it makes it hard for you to contribute to the conversation.</blockquote>\nNo, I don't accept that premise for the reason mentioned above.<br/><br/>In conclusion, what your argument comes down to, for me, is that you would enjoy it if games were more diverse. Additionally, it looks like you want more games of a certain type - not because this will encourage women to play, but simply for your enjoyment. For some reason you want to tie this type of games to gender stereotypes.<br/><br/>In the end, being an amateur female game designer who does not produce games that cater to your tastes, I really don't have anything to contribute.

TaoJeannes corrected us on the direction we were taking the thread, and asked again about gender bias inherent is game-design. Can someone provide an example about what is a masculine or feminine design decision, other than art direction or theme?<br/><br/>For example I'm still confused about in what war-gaming is mechanically masculine. War-games didn't really have a premise 'back in the day;' they were a mechanical rules set. How is that "masculine"? The first-gen rpgs were straight up resource-management-survival-horror-in-a-cave games. Is that "masculine"? What part? What is the part we are really trying to dissect here?<br/><br/>EDIT:<br/><br/>TaoJeannes:<br/><br/>Concepts like games made 'for men' are being used, but no concrete examples are given. if D&amp;D is masculine, and Nobilis is feminine... why? Can you give a concrete, explicit example of what gives each of these a gender bias? If not, this whole conversation seems rather... pointless?

Like, without even thinking about it, which gender would you assign wargaming too? It's about war and violence! Probably men. I mean, your thinking brain would go "no, women can play war things too!" But the cultural tendency, you might think, would be to assign it to men. This is without statistics or science or anything. Just something ingrained in your mind.<br/><br/>I think that's maybe what's at issue. If gaming arises from something that is primarily man associated, and all our RPGs have warlike combat in them, is that designing away from women? Is that just what we assume women wouldn't want to play because of gender bias? Is it actually something women wouldn't want to play because of gender bias? Is warlike violence and combat just a part of RPGs, and all genders can access it regardless of bias? <br/><br/>If I were to design something without warlike violence, that doesn't inherently make it feminine or masculine. Part of the problem is that, in culture, the default is masculine, the exception is feminine. That makes access to all things available to men, and access to all things not available to women. Warlike violence is one of those borderline things in our culture right now. We're saturated with it, but it's still very much a masculine thing. <br/><br/>I think the idea is to design in order to make it accessible or inclusive to women. I love warlike violence in my games! You can't design to my gender... you have to design to my taste. But how do I feel included in a game, as a woman?<br/><br/>If I see art representing women that isn't completely ridiculous.<br/>If there are stories in the game's fiction about cool women I can respect that aren't cliche's.<br/>If mechanics or narrative don't limit my ability to play things I want to play based on the gender of my character.<br/><br/>Things like that.<br/><br/>This is a really complex question. I'm not an expert on gender bias, for sure. But I think that's maybe more along the lines of what the OP was going for.

I will say that when I was younger, I was very much in the minority in geeky type hobbies (and at University and my professional life as an engineer), and the comment that Rob made about new girls being sniffed over by the unattached males in the group <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xh3qt9jhAW0" rel="nofollow">definitely applies</a> (it should be flattering, but actually can get pretty tedious); as well as getting a bigger share of the 'emotional work' that goes into maintaining a community ("There's a thing that's bothering me - and you're a girl!  Talk to me about it."  Uh, yeah, I'm not actually very good with people.  ;-) )  And these downsides (often not expressed in creepy ways, but still downsides) tend to go down as the gender ratio starts to even out.<br/><br/>In the community that I'm currently in, the ratio of women doing tabletop roleplaying is about 25% (using convention attendance as a proxy), and larping is about 50% (totally awesome!)  For people who are interested in doing outreach in their local communities, that 25% feels like a <i>lot</i> of women around.  It's enough that you can have women in your game without having to make an effort, it's no big deal to be female and in a leadership position (running cons, writing high profile games, pushing for community wide changes), there are some kinds of games (like riffing off Austen or PG Wodehouse or teenage girl social dynamics) that get good attendance - men as well as women, that I suspect just wouldn't happen without a certain critical mass of XX chromosomes around.  I've also read texts about encouraging behaviour change in the workplace that put the tipping point ratio at about 30-33% - if you can get that proportion of people to change what they're doing to what you want, to everyone else it starts to feel inevitable and like it's everywhere already, so they feel they should fall in with the change as well.  So if you want to change your gender ratio, as Jason Corley said about chess tournaments, I'd say that it's important to push hard in the early days, but once you're up to around 1/4 or 1/3 you'll have a self sustaining density - people will just turn up through their social networks or because they perceive your hobby as a 'thing that people like they are' do.\n<blockquote>The question is this: If the bedrock of tabletop RPGs were not male-centric wargames, but rather a different female-centric or androgynous premise, how would it look different? How should this change in thinking change the way we're designing games?</blockquote>\nTo go back to the original question, as a thought experiment about if roleplaying the hobby hadn't come out of military enthusiasts playing Braunsteins, but maybe from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bront%C3%AB_family#Literary_evolution" rel="nofollow">Bronte-esque</a> group of women putting some formality onto their shared story telling, some stuff that you might get:<br/>(Can people assume lots of disclaimers about how I'm proposing <i>tendencies</i> rather than any particular individual or group?)<br/><br/>- <b>Lots of crafting tie ins.</b>  You can already see that in the ways that many women engage with roleplaying and related hobbies - it's common for women I know to turn up to their gaming group with knitting or embroidery or something to fidget with while they talk; women-oriented publications like Cerise magazine and Gaming As Women both put in regular features about crafting or sharing food with one's gaming group; anecdotes from my friends who are into wargaming is that they know very few women playing at a highly competitive level, but they're used to seeing women doing really well in the painting competitions; craft days and prop making are a great community builder in my local larp scene.  Lots of stuff like that.  Things that aren't exclusively female or pursued by every female, but do show up as a trend.<br/><br/>- <b>Different aesthetics. </b>  This is kinda linked in with the crafting thing.  I think that a lot of hobbies that are stereotypically 'female' have got a lot of focus on micromanaging choices around colour and texture - so textile arts, bead work, scrapbooking, being interested in fashion, that whole class of activity can look kinda boring if you're not into it, but if you <i>are </i>into it, it's really engaging.  So, I think that <i>a</i> reason that games like The Sims did well with female audiences is because they enabled a large amount of customisation and aesthetic choices.  I've also read accounts of women engaging with video games where they found it really rewarding being able to customise their character images in a lot of detail, body shape, faces, outfits, all that stuff.  That's only part of the game experience for them - these are the same women who talked a lot about strategy and enjoying going out and blowing stuff up, but it's one that they appreciated.  (Please note, when I say that I think a lot of women are interested in aesthetics, I don't mean "Make it all pink."  That pretty much strips out all the creative customisation features that are appealing.)  Conversely, I've watched men I know half-hypnotise themselves doing stuff like micromanaging inventory layouts in video games, or poring over treasure lists, or keeping a database of every book they've read ever.  It's not an interest that I shared, but it certainly looked like they were getting a dopamine hit out of it - maybe that's something that affected the design of D&amp;D style games?<br/><br/>I also think that the artwork would be different.  I'm happy for my opinion on this to be challenged by an Arts or Design major, but my general impression of art in the bulk of roleplaying, video gaming and fantasy/SF fields is that it kind of has a tunnel vision effect - the images are designed to funnel your attention to a few key parts of the image, particularly art that gets labelled as catering to the 'male gaze'.  It's not just the content of these pictures, it's how the images direct your attention strongly to a few focal points.  I suspect that if fantasy and roleplaying were more of a 'for women' thing, that the artwork might tend to come with a more diffuse focal ground, possibly with different base palettes (less bold and/or murky), and be more textured.<br/><br/>(Part 2 follows, exceeded character limit)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/StephaniePegg" title="StephaniePegg"><img alt="StephaniePegg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/185/n6ACKVL4YBWQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/StephaniePegg">StephaniePegg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391708/#Comment_391708" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-28T21:24:45+00:00" title="September 28, 2012  9:24PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>- <b>Different kinds of stores.</b> You guys all know the stereotypical cave, right?  Not every gaming store or comics store, but often enough to be A Thing, where it's crowded and dark and maybe a bit smelly?  Boy space.  It probably wouldn't exist if roleplaying were a 'girl' thing - hobby stores would more likely have wider aisles and better lighting.  (There is a really cool ebook called <a href="http://friendsoflulu.wordpress.com/fol-archives/friends-of-lulu-retailing-handbook-1997/" rel="nofollow">"How to Get Girls (Into Your Store)"</a> that I read years ago that talks about this stuff, but I've also read accounts of how hardware stores decided that they wanted to get more women in the door, for reasons of greed, and found that opening out their stores and giving some basic customer training to their staff made their profits shoot up.)<br/><br/>- <b>Some different content.</b>  So, I'm going to base this section on my own experiences and observing my friends; but also my take on a lot of women-oriented fiction - both genres that almost come with tags saying 'women-only', like romances and fanfiction; but also work by female authors with female protagonists in the more general genres, like detective novels, fantasy/sf and young adult fiction.  (If people think that my very reductivist summation of themes doesn't represent them, well, fair enough, but the opinions I'm expressing here are influenced by multiple texts in multiple genres.)<br/><br/>I think there'd still be lots of action-adventure stories, but there's a But.  I think there would be less focus on the specific details of how a conflict plays out, like spending an hour and a half crunching out the numbers to resolve a fight, and more attention paid to inbetween scenes.  I think that games that spend a reasonable amount of time negotiating the relationships between the characters (sometimes romance, but also friendships and family relationships), would be much closer to the default than 'unusual games worthy of note'.  I think that violence would be treated differently: less about keeping score of hitpoints followed by healing back to the status quo, much more about recovery from violence and how to deal with it emotionally.  I'm going to expand on that last point some - in the women-oriented fiction I cited above, Hurt/Comfort is a recurring Thing.  It's not the only way that acts of violence are handled, but it turns up over and over and over again - where the act of violence itself (maybe someone's lost their family to a tragic accident, or been beaten, or sexually assaulted) gets dealt with very briefly in the text, often with depersonalised attackers or even happening before the story starts, and the rest of the story is 'about' how someone goes about getting their life back, dealing with PTSD, controlling the information of who knows what about what happened, who helps who recover, how to reintegrate into one's community...  It's the opposite of refrigerating a character, and it's something that I generally only see in fiction that's got women in the intended audience.  Fiction that seems aimed predominately at guys, like big action movies, seems to be more interested in playing out the precursors to violence (like when heroes and villains trade threats at each other) and the details of the violence (like who punches who), but seems to move over the recovery phase pretty quickly - or move straight into the revenge scene.  Anyway, it's something I've been thinking about.  (And getting depressed about, but what the hell.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391715/#Comment_391715" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-28T22:35:12+00:00" title="September 28, 2012 10:35PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As an aside, I'm down for Bronte play formalization and craftiness coming more into play in games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391718/#Comment_391718" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-28T22:54:19+00:00" title="September 28, 2012 10:54PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stephanie, that's a couple of really thoughtful and thought-provoking posts!

Nobody.<br/><br/>What is immensely frustrating, in these discussions, is that you can have an interesting, nuanced exchange: then someone comes in and says "I just think it's silly to divide games into masculine and feminine".<br/><br/>Well, of course it is. We all think that.<br/><br/>There are subtler arguments you can make: that roleplaying games often celebrate men, so perhaps we should celebrate women more; that games often celebrate <i>work that has historically been done by men</i>, so perhaps we should celebrate mothers, nurses and administrators more; that games often celebrate patriarchal themes, so perhaps we should rebel against those.<br/><br/>This isn't equivalent to dividing games into masculine and feminine.

The audience might be "people who like zombie stories".<br/><br/>Often that audience will be dominated by some demographic. Much of the published RPGs have a audience in mind that consist of a mostly young, mostly middle class, mostly white, and mostly male demographic. This is true for example "people who like zombie stories". The trouble woith roleplaying games is that that the only target group. Most other medias have works that is aimed at other target group.<br/><br/>Name one RPG who has women over 50 as is target audience. There is none. <br/><br/>Name movies and books that have that group as a target audience. Even if that a quite ignored audience you have no problem naming a few books and movies aimed at that group.<br/><br/>If you want to make RPGs that don't target the typical group "young, white, middle class, male" then you have to stop doing that. You need to look what cultural "hooks"  there are available that might interest other groups.<br/><br/>You can't say "But in an ideal world everyone should like zombie stories!", because that isn't the world we live in. Things are different culturally coded, and if you want stuff that attract other groups then young, white, middle class males, you need to look at what is popular in other groups.

I want to be that storied hero of legend. I just want to be it as a woman.<br/><br/>Roleplaying games let me play out that particular fantasy. I get to be a woman hero, albeit doing men's work, in mens power fantasy roles.<br/><br/>But in our collective history, stories about epic women being epic heroes don't really exist (they do, but few and far between and rarely if ever written by women for women). Oddly, fantasy roleplaying games (or sci-fi even for that matter) give me the ability to make those stories now. Are these men's stories or women's stories? If I was born in an age where I had the ability to record epic tales as a woman, would I have put women in those same roles? In order to tell the story of the woman as epic hero, I HAVE to play something that's been considered for ages a man's story. When does this belong less to men, and more to every gender?<br/><br/>This makes me so confused about my gender agenda when playing games sometimes. It's not that I <i>want</i> to play a male power fantasy. It's just that it's the only one available to me. And that actually has nothing to do with the history of roleplaying games, and everything to do with recorded stories.<br/><br/>Stories about "women's work", while I find to be compelling and important because it's important to tell women's stories in order to level the playing field... still feel more like "women's work" and less like "equality". I put those in quotations because these are huge generalizations with lots of history and nuance I'm not tackling in this post, and I know that.<br/><br/>I learned all this stuff about women's stories and the power divide from Judith Butler. Someone more academic than me, please add some more knowledges I don't have! I'm curious if someone has insight into this particular problem.<br/><br/>All of this is relevant to the thread because I'm curious about how to tell "women's stories" and if there is such a thing that's separate from "men's stories" or if really all we're doing is closing the gap by being more inclusive, instead of widening the gap and separating out those gender roles even further.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391766/#Comment_391766" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-29T09:37:18+00:00" title="September 29, 2012  9:37AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>But in our collective history, stories about epic women being epic heroes don't really exist (they do, but few and far between and rarely if ever written by women for women).

I want to be able to play feminist characters. I want to be able to play relationship drama. Sometimes I want to kill stuff with guns. Sometimes I want to feel feelings. And I want narrative above all else. Interesting, complex, non-cliched narrative with fully-realized, complex lady characters that don't get reduced down to a stereotype. <br/><br/>Just to second the thing about "women's stories" -- in fiction, stories about women by women frequently get ghettoized into "women's lit" and denied the accolades of canonization. There's this underlying assumption that narratives about women (and the stuff that ordinary women do) is only interesting to women, or isn't worthwhile for everyone to read. And I think that's a missed opportunity for everyone.

It also implies there should be "games for women,"  whereas I think there are games that aren't very women friendly. A very large number of women play wargames and other games of violent confict, especially video games. The issue isn't that it's about war, or about violent conflict. I want games that aren't about conflict and games which appeal to people, but not on the basis wargames are more for men.<br/><br/>I find also statements like "men like power gaming, women like being the healer" problematic. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/lizziestark">@lizziestark</a> I agree with your post entirely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391967/#Comment_391967" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-01T11:41:55+00:00" title="October  1, 2012 11:41AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, Lizzie - <br/><br/>I agree that stories to get ghettoized as "women's lit" - or more generally that those tropes are classed as only fit for women.  An important corrolary is that it's open how we react to that.  Do we try non-ghettoized alternatives, or do we attempt to reclaim the ghettoized genre?  <br/><br/>I think both should be attempted, which means having some games that are designed non-gender-specific, but also some games that are designed for women (as well as some games that are designed for mens). "Mad About the Boy" would be an example of a game designed for women, I think.  (You're running that this Friday, right?)  <br/><br/>I don't see anything wrong with that.  I've never run anything which was for exclusively one-gender players, but I have run several games that are focused on a single gender - my Conan game "Brawny Thews", Hellcats &amp; Hockeysticks, and Macho Women With Guns.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/StephaniePegg" title="StephaniePegg"><img alt="StephaniePegg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/185/n6ACKVL4YBWQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/StephaniePegg">StephaniePegg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391968/#Comment_391968" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-01T11:57:49+00:00" title="October  1, 2012 11:57AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I prefer the idea of creating games that don't exclude women (usually unintentionally) by their language, male gaze, visual design and assumptions rather than creating games "for women."

So there is a history of problematic releases along gender lines. Personally i really like Lego friends and think they are overall superior toys and some of the best toy work lego has done. the mini figs are sweet and the colors are some of my favorites. I hope parents let their kids play with whatever toys the kids want to. (that includes both genders playing with the friends line or any other line) <br/><br/>So boy and girl toys and rpgs. Aside from maybe an rpg about pregnancy or being able to piss in a urinal while standing. I'm not sure what would make a game definitively masculine or feminine.<br/><br/>I hear great reports about GxB and how women have been drawn to it <a href="http://celstyle.com/?p=233" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://celstyle.com/?p=233</a> but there are plenty of guys who like to play it. it was also designed by a dude, again not sure if that means anything. but this also falls along audience lines, GxB draws an audience from anime conventions and manga fans.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_392192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392192/#Comment_392192" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-03T06:50:49+00:00" title="October  3, 2012  6:50AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>At a BlizzCon panel discussion an female querist was booed for suggesting that maybe the female characters should be able to wear clothes. </blockquote>Games make young males into dumb asses. They partake in the creation of a culture that actively dismiss and suppress any female view on the world. Sad thing.\n<blockquote>With the notable exception of Nobilis, even games with female contributors ultimately seem to be about fighting. Beyond the wargame roots, the other obvious explanation is that combat is the most easy and obvious form of conflict, and it's hard to build any kind of play that doesn't revolve around conflict. </blockquote>Combat is "easier to build" due to the sheer fact that you copy other games, with small variations. If you start exploring other types of conflicts, or themes, you will find it easier and easier for each game you make; in the end you may come to see combat as simply weird ...<br/><br/>And one more thing; nothing is simple in combat, unless you do it so superfluous it has nothing to do with real combat. A overwhelmingly majority of rpgs do it that way, and is part of fooling a lot of young males into believing it is cool to fight.\n<blockquote>The question is this: If the bedrock of tabletop RPGs were not male-centric wargames, but rather a different female-centric or androgynous premise, how would it look different? How should this change in thinking change the way we're designing games?</blockquote>We would be less concerned with mechanics, and more concerned with developing a plethora of effective dialogue-techniques. <br/><br/>And don't you worry; there are game-smiths around the world who are actively doing this already; you will see games of a totally different kind long before you die of old age.

I've been playing RPGs for over 30 years. Very nearly all my regular gaming groups have had at least one other girl or woman in them. I know I'm not the only one. <br/><br/>Arguments about what sort of design might better attract women mildly baffle me. Emily has excellent points above, about the shift from combat to conflict being note-worthy, and there's the whole gradual cultural shift in recognizing sexist or otherwise attitudes and text and art that might turn folks off to a given game or a given GM or a given gaming group, but the idea that one should somehow design special special games to attract a certain demographic "because that's what they like" is odd. Sure, don't make your design offensive. Sure, listen to feedback about your design. Sure, know your audience (as Erin says above). But design for PLAYERS, not WOMEN players or GAY players or ASIAN players.\n<blockquote><br/>The question is this: If the bedrock of tabletop RPGs were not male-centric wargames, but rather a different female-centric or androgynous premise, how would it look different?

As is anecdotaly pointed out several times in the thread, there are plenty of womenfolk who enjoy a good fierce fight. Throughout history, women have fought. Who was defending the homefront every time the menfolk marched off to the battlefield? The manner of fighting might differ some, might be more devious and political and ruthless and less about moving tight groups of bodies from one place to the next, but women have a sense for warfare and fighting and strategy and competition just the same. This points back to Emily's comments about conflict over combat. Conflict is gender-free, combat is more gendered. Design for interesting conflict, calibrate the blood to where you want it for your game design, and play games with women. That way more women will be playing games.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392354/#Comment_392354" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-04T13:01:23+00:00" title="October  4, 2012  1:01PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The weird thing about women in gaming is how we have always been here, yet there seems to be an continuous, deep-rooted impression that we are suddenly just arriving on the scene.

That narrative implies that we shouldn't be concerned about it so much anymore, because bias is a thing of the past.  <br/><br/>By my estimate, tabletop RPGs early on had roughly 5% - 10% women.  In the nineties this went up to around 10% - 20% women, and has stayed at roughly that level.  Larps have a significantly higher percentage of women (30% - 40%, varying depending on genre).  As far as I have seen, the newer style story games have about the same ratio of women as other tabletop RPGs.  \n<blockquote>Part of the answer here may be to look at wargames as less male-centric?

I think combat-like social conflict can be gendered.  For example, White Wolf's larp system (MET) allowed social conflicts - but my observation was that they were rarely used - and when they were used it was generally by men rather than women.  I feel like that is also true for my tabletop experience as well.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa" title="Bad_Santa"><img alt="Bad_Santa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://anvalisok.com/cthulhu.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa">Bad_Santa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392373/#Comment_392373" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-04T16:33:44+00:00" title="October  4, 2012  4:33PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can't remember enough to find it in my search, but there was a thread a while ago about what mechanics might look like for a game about social cooperation, instead of social conflict.<br/><br/>I'm currently working on a My Little Pony hack for Mythender.  It's interesting turning a game where you can terrorize mortals for power into a game about friendship and cooperation, but it feels like it's working because the underlying current in Mythender is pitting several desires against each other.  So in MLP, it's about individuality against group conformity.  Doing things together bolsters the group, mechanically, while doing things alone lets you drain off that to do high impact things.

The show is pretty good though.<br/><br/>I have some more to actually add, but I'll do it when I'm less tired.

It's almost cool to like MLP and gives one an almost iconoclastic status.  I'm in my 30's, big bushy beard, former military, I mountain climb and go camping in very remote places... oh and I watch MLP.  Its underground popularity allows me to express and acknowledge something about myself that is very different from a lot of the other (somewhat) masculine things about me.<br/><br/>Not everyone is interested in exploring that "feminine" side, but there is a desire to do so within the existing gaming community, and people not currently gamers (like women).  I put it in quotes, because it's not accurate, but for my limited vocabulary it works as a shorthand.  Looking at the feminine side of our culture, how issues arise and are dealt with, how non-gender problems are solved and relationships are built won't just open up gaming to new audiences, it has the potential to give us new ways to game as well.<br/><br/>In FATE, you can get someone to cooperate with you by causing them stress.  Insults, intimidation, threats, being overbearing are a few examples and they're all pretty aggressive.  In a game where you can create scene Aspects for your friends to use, you can try to influence them by creating rewarding opportunities, but that means they have to follow your lead.<br/><br/>This doesn't necessarily reflect cooperation and compromise terribly well, or at least not in a mechanical sense.  If there is compromise, it happens between the players or characters on level of interaction outside of the rules.  I'm not terribly familiar with LARPs, but the little bit that I know, I'm guessing a lot of this can happen outside of the mechanics of the game as well, but there the game is primarily made up of social interaction.  A table-top is a much smaller setting, so we need mechanics that reinforce a broader array of social dynamics, not just dominance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17264/the-female-gamer-dilemma" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17264/the-female-gamer-dilemma" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17264/the-female-gamer-dilemma/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17264/the-female-gamer-dilemma/p3" rel="next">3</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17264/the-female-gamer-dilemma/p3" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F17264%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F17264%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>The Female Gamer Dilemma - Page 3 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17264/the-female-gamer-dilemma/p3" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="The Female Gamer Dilemma - Page 3" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17264/the-female-gamer-dilemma/p3" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Also, a cautionary tale seems in order.
