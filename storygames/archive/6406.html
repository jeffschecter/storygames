Each time you come in contact with the mutants, you have to choose an exposure level.  Low means infection is likely but you have some metagame control over it, high means it is unlikely but you have no control.  There are six, six-item mutation lists, so you would roll 2d6 to find your particular new problem.  One thing to note is that getting the same thing twice "activates" it, so maybe you get extra arms that just hang there, but if you get extra arms again, they work!  So any time you get to choose, that's potentially good.  Although you want to keep your mutations subtle so that people don't start hunting you like you are hunting other mutants.  Anyway:<br/><br/><b>Bathed in gore</b><br/>Infection on any roll but a six.<br/>Upon infection, roll for region and choose any of the six mutations.<br/><br/><b>Damn, that was messy</b><br/>Infection on a roll of one through four. <br/>Upon infection, roll twice for region and mutation and choose the result you prefer.<br/><br/><b>A splash here and there</b><br/>Infection on a roll of one through three. <br/>Upon infection, roll for region and mutation.<br/><br/><b>Crap, I got a little on my kilt</b><br/>Infection on a roll of one or two.<br/>Upon infection, roll twice for region and mutation and<b> let your friends </b>choose the least agreeable result.<br/><br/><b>I don't think I got any on me</b><br/>Infection on a roll of one.<br/>Upon infection, roll for region and mutation two times and take both mutations.<br/><br/>My question, Story Games - do you see an optimal path here?  Is there a compelling reason to choose the edge cases of high or low probability?  Assume you don't really want mutations, but if you have to get them, you want them to be awesome.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141688/#Comment_141688" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-30T07:43:30+00:00" title="April 30, 2008  7:43AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>I don't think I got any on me</b> and <b>Crap, I got a little on my kilt</b> seems like the optimal path to me.

We farm, we starve all winter, we die young.  There's not much of a feudal thing going on because, well, there are <i>insects</i>.  They are big - man-sized, bigger.  They are reasonably intelligent, wildly varied in form and utility, and completely unknowable.  They keep us on the move. <br/><br/>The insects move from place to place and, for the most part, we get out of the way because they are fucking dangerous.  Sometimes, though, they settle somewhere worth fighting for, and then lunatics with swords get hired to clean the bugs out.  When there is no paying work, the lunatics with swords either become vicious warlords or wander into bug-infested areas looking for stuff left behind by the previous human inhabitants.  Those poor fools often left in a hurry, with what they could carry and no more.  Once the bugs get a notion to settle down and build their dirt cathedrals, there's a mad rush to get out of the way, because they bring disease.<br/><br/>Their transparent insides-goo is highly infectious and causes your body to grow insect-like parts.  Seriously!  It's amazing.  New brains, even, ones that start fighting with your own for control of your changing body.  Eventually they win, and that's why people avoid cutting up the bugs.  Unless you're, you know, a lunatic with a sword.<br/><br/>Acquired mutations are usually dead and weird looking.  Sometimes mutant traits get reinforced and become functional and weird looking.  There are guys, half gone, with huge rock-crushing insect jaws, swiveling leg joints, and freaky glands that shoot acid.  They are hated and feared and usually hunted down with more enthusiasm than the insects they are becoming.  But it's best not to mess with a guy who can see in the dark through his segmented fucking eyes and has feathery antennae that can smell colors or something.  That's a guy to leave alone. He's got enough problems without you sneaking up on him with a rock.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone" title="Quintin Stone"><img alt="Quintin Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://rps.net/QS/Images/pipboy-32x32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone">Quintin Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141731/#Comment_141731" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-30T10:50:37+00:00" title="April 30, 2008 10:50AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Haha, man, that sounds like fun. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141749/#Comment_141749" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-30T11:59:03+00:00" title="April 30, 2008 11:59AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>My question, Story Games - do you see an optimal path here?

Like, I'd probably start with the least likely (1 in 6 chance) and then once I got a mutation, especially if it was something dead and useless, I'd be going for Gore and Messy to try and double it up and turn it into something useful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141751/#Comment_141751" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-30T12:12:56+00:00" title="April 30, 2008 12:12PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That makes sense, and I can get behind that sort of logic.

"Enhanced":  It fuses with another ganglia elsewhere in the body to form an auxiliary brain.  This is bad.<br/>2:  Gastric caeca, enzyme producer.  Enhanced:  Allows spitting of acid.<br/>3:  Malpighian tubules.  Enhanced:  Pumps out hemolyph, eliminating O2 carrying blood and making you an infection carrier.<br/>4:  Crop, holding place for extra food.  Enhanced:  Adds proventriculus, allowing consumption of pretty much any organic matter.<br/>5:  Breathing spiracles in abdomen.  Enhanced:  Adds trachae for lungless oxygen intake.<br/>6:  Tergite plate, abdominal integuemetal plate.  Enhanced:  Hardens into armor, fore or aft.<br/><br/>The lists run about 70/30 in favor of obvious mutations, so there are some subtle ones.  If you can't see it, you're good to go socially.  Don't ask, don't tell.  So on this list 1,2,3,and 4 are all subtle.  The list for Head is 5/1 not subtle.<br/><br/>John!  I'm not sure what to do about this yet.  There needs to be some plausibility (I figured you don't pepper them with arrows because they self-seal like airplane fuel tanks), so maybe they are just fireproof.

This provides a powerful motivation to favor some defensive techniques.  If getting knocked down in armor means you are out of the fight but still in danger, you might reconsider the benefit it gives you (which needs to be balanced yet).  But also note that I really want to smash the guy in armor, so you can anticipate that power attack coming on, so there's a little out-thinking and back and forth going on, too.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142491/#Comment_142491" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-05T14:33:54+00:00" title="May  5, 2008  2:33PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a question - some of the paths I'm imagining are pretty miserable - the fool's path, the villain's path - they just make your dude a ne'er-do-well.

My money would be on that being one of the first things that get changed after a round of good playtesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrex: Lose your next action whenever you Maneuver in Armor (or Command in Linen) strikes me as a more practical implementation of the concept.  But that's just speculation.  Actual Play is king for something like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, give some thought to the tactical variety.  You have a set of actions that can be performed.  The joy of the system is the interaction between those actions.  If you prevent certain actions from being used at all, then you're limiting everyone to just a subset of the allowed actions.  That may not be enough variety to provide sufficient interplay.  Swashbuckler! did this, but they had 20 or more total actions so each subset was still good size and customizable so it worked pretty well.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might find limiting the order actions can be played in to be a good alternative.  Frex you might designate some actions as being Fatigueing and others as being Dominating (or something) and say that you can't play two Fatiguing actions in a row wearing armor and you can't play two Dominating actions in a row wearing linen.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of possibilities there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142534/#Comment_142534" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-05T18:08:39+00:00" title="May  5, 2008  6:08PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for the paths question.  I'd approach it like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n"What are things that an X can do / has access to" in this setting.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe a Villain gets henchmen.<br/>\nMaybe a Fool gets to have extra wealth (from selfishly keeping it for himself)<br/>\nMaybe a Gujin becomes feared so that others back down more often.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo each Path can become its own "class" (if you will) that has its own "class feat" that you get better at as you "level up" in that Path.  The Villain gets more henchman with each advance on the Villain Path, the Fool gets more Wealth with each advance on the Fool Path, the Gujin gets more intimidating with each advance on the Gujin path, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Path's that are already beneficial of themselves can have "feats" that include obligations as well as benefits.  The more villainous Paths are all about the selfish...the personal power that being villainous can get you.  The Path's that are more heroic come with catches.  Some kind of community entanglement that welds the character more tightly to society.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142848/#Comment_142848" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T09:02:15+00:00" title="May  7, 2008  9:02AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's good stuff, Ralph, and I thank you.

I critiqued Rich Forest's excellent Game Chef game, <i>Jackknife</i>, which is super simple and uses a 1d6 randomizer all the time in defiance of subtlety and complexity.  Works great.
