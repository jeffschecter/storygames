                    Working on a game called The Cog Wars.  The game itself isn't the topic here (though feel free to ask about it).<br/>
<br/>
Playtesting is.  I've gone through about five completely rewritten versions of the playtest document, tested each, and it keeps getting prettier, simpler, and harder to rewrite.  I've been at this for over a month, and I'm picking up the pace this week - I'll likely have three seperate and complete test games this week alone.<br/>
<br/>
Gah.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you that have managed to finally get your games done, how many trips through playtest-and-revise did it take you?                </div>

                            My Life with Master benefited from a lot of independent playtesting. I only ran two playtests of it myself. One at GenCon in 2002, and one locally the following September.<br/>
<br/>
Now Acts of Evil is an entirely different story. I ran a playtest at GenCon last August. And then reworked mechanics and entirely redrafted the playtest rules text. Then I ran a playtest locally this past winter. And I ran a playtest at Forge Midwest. And then again reworked mechanics and entirely redrafted the rules text. Currently I'm running a playtest over IRC. And another reworking and redrafting is on the horizon. Mechanically, it's very close...but not quite right yet.<br/>

<p>I hate playtesting.  Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.</p>
<p>Capes went through something like twenty sessions of playtesting and revision ... not counting the dozen or so solo-playtests where I played the rules through on my own and either made an example worth seeing or a train-wreck worth pitying (or, often, both).</p>
<p>HATE!</p>

                            I'd say twenty is the sweet spot for iterative playtesting - that's about what The Roach got as well.  That includes blind tests I had nothing to do with, convention play with strangers, local play with gamers and a session with non-gamers.  The text was a living document throughout, and changed from test to test.  <br/><br/>I'll also point out that design and AP feedback on The Forge was huge for me, and having smart people think about and comment on your ideas and concerns, even outside the context of playtesting, is really useful.                        </div>

                            Um. I've run three 1001 Nights games, and Ben just ran one in China (!) Plus the first two do-these-mechanics-work sessions. I'd *love* more feedback, but other than Ben's excellent call and a few 'wow, looks good!', I stab blindly on.                        </div>

                            Back in the depths of the <em>FLFS</em> playtest, I actually ran or played in four games in the space of three days at one point.  It was around playtest <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2320&amp;Mode=like">#20</a> that I got the sense that I'd beaten on the thing enough times to tease out all its problems and address them.<br/><br/>Now, I actually like playtesting.  What I hate is <em>arranging for</em> playtesting.  Nothing strips my ego like trying to get people together to try a game I designed, and then dealing with the inevitable cancellations and postponements.  More than once I considered just dropping the entire endeavor.                        </div>

                            I'm with Josh on that, you can cry out for playtest, and no one wants in... I've considered dropping the thing till I get some more peer review back, but only when I raised the banner time and time again did I end up getting anything..<br/><br/>Cranium Rats, ayie...<br/><br/>I had Alpha, where I just typed the ideas as they came. Then came Beta 1.0, Beta 1.1 was rewritten so non-mind readers could know what I meant.<br/>Beta 1.2 was where I removed a bunch of mechanics and had the system mostly as is, sleek.<br/>Beta 2.0 was rewritten for clarity. People kept saying they can't read my rules, so I did this, even though I said I'd only do it after playtesting.<br/><br/>I finally got playtesting with version 2.0 a week and a half ago, a very short one session. That and a couple more threads led to the very recent Beta 2.1.<br/><br/>Good thing my release plan is only February 2007...                        </div>

                            I'm more on the Meguey side than the Tony side. Mortal Coil was in development a long, long time, but the final version of the rules were formally tested four times by me and twice by independent playtesters. By the time I farm rules out for testing, I am very close to done, though, and have worked out 80% of the problems. At least I think so.                        </div>
