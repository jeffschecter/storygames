Basically, when PCs are on the tavern or Inn (or well, really, any place at all) the GM asks the players: "What kind of rumours of interest you hear?" providing them with a couple of words for inspiration for each player to come up with a really basic premise for a quest. Then all PCs regroup and decide which quest sounds more interesting, and the GM just implements it.<br/><br/>It's working wonders so far. One PC heard a town was being attacked and it should had something to do with the evil god of the setting (which the players created themselves too). Another heard of a wondrous artifact, a mantle of some sort and rolled to see how easy would be to find a buyer if they went and stole it. The last player went to the bartender, who told him about an old battleground where he might still find magical weapons. The group decided to visit that place first. They noticed they were being followed by someone and tried confronting the guy, which ended up turning into another quest again.<br/><br/>Among the things I like the most from this trick is that the players come up with quests that actually interest them, that they can provide infinite ones and even collaborate to make another PCs quest more interesting. No longer railroading, asking them to collaborate or otherwise coax them into following specific quests. I love it that I don't know what is going to happen next and I'm as much surprised as them by whatever comes up. <br/><br/>Now that I don't have to guess what kind of choices the players would take nor otherwise influence their choices, I'm relaxed enough to deal with other parts of the game, like the encumbrance and hexcrawling. About the encumbrance, I found this amazingly simple way to handle it in <a href="http://www.lastgaspgrimoire.com/arts-crafts-morbidly-encumbered-edition/" rel="nofollow">lastgaspgrimoire.com</a>. Now each player has a separate sheet for their items, which now I handle them as small post-its with their weight listed and it's up to them to decide if they carry it or not and deal with the encumbrance, or pass it to a friend with more space in their pack, or plain drop some other less important stuff. <br/><br/>Combined with hexcrawl stuff, now  even the weight of the rations matters. They haven't even heard of tresure yet and they are already wondering how are they going to carry it with them once they get it.<br/><br/>So far I've got tricks to make up interesting NPCs and dungeons on the go; I can do monsters from scratch too but I'm not so sure I can make these too well while playing. Whenever I'm using monsters from the MM I prefer to prep in advance, as some monsters are more appropiate than others for different types of encounters. My players had fun, but I found a group of Manes I pulled randomly to be somewhat uninteresting. Then there's this "You see a nicely mounted reception hall with a red carpet and an old suit of armor in standing position holding a sword on it's hands" encounter I want to try, where all three are animated objects that work amazingly well as a group (carpet grapples, armour can tank a bit and both the armour and the sword can hit the poor bastard who got grappled by the carpet without damaging the carpet too much.<br/><br/>I'm thinking I'll still have to properly prep combat scenarios, to pull them and spice up whenever players come up with a quest where these can apply.<br/><br/>I'm also making prep from the consequences of whatever the party does, to show them the impact their character's actions have on the world.<br/><br/>How do you do to make up interesting stuff on the go? Any tricks you wanna share?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455440/#Comment_455440" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-02T09:36:00+00:00" title="August  2, 2016  9:36AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm doing this for 5e and enjoying it.

To make it flow better, the amount of information required should be as small as possible. I found that it all works better and faster when you:<br/><br/>-Ask a player to connect two or three things.<br/>-Set a subject and ask the player for details about it.<br/>-Ask the player what could X character be thinking given the situation.<br/><br/>At some points you don't even need to ask, perhaps players themselves will give their input as a joke, like "wouldn't be funny if Y happens right now?"<br/><br/>The thing is to embrace player input as long as it's barely possible / logical / follows the consequences from anything that has happened before. But for this to work, it's best if the player's input is kept short. You can easily put a strange event into the world through the radio, a rumour of something that can be either false, truth or just deformed. Anything that suggests things instead of imposing them. That way the GM can keep things under control, as all we need is some inspiration.<br/><br/>About identifying the important stuff, well, what matters most here for the GM is "what's  next?". And I mean like, inmediatly next. Do the players decided where to go? Who's going to show next in front of them? They have a lot of information now, but what could it all mean?. <br/><br/>If you've got ideas and inspiration enough from the players to answer that, the next question is "how can I make this better?". Detail, cinematic narration, plot twists, everything can be used and improved at least a bit, even if it's just by mixing it with something previously done.<br/><br/>Use player input sparingly, oh, and if you're in the middle of the session, it's a lot better to ask things addressing the characters, not the players, to prevent breaking their immersion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455457/#Comment_455457" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-02T18:11:46+00:00" title="August  2, 2016  6:11PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>At some points you don't even need to ask, perhaps players themselves will give their input as a joke, like "wouldn't be funny if Y happens right now?"</blockquote>\nYeah, this happens all the time in my group.

I was even using a randomly generated dungeon from the web, one sad thing I'll never ever be doing again. In the middle of the dungeon they half-jokingly say: "frag the factions (who were railroading them) let's start our own cult!"<br/><br/>And instead of blocking them as any other GM would do (I've never heard too many accounts of players starting their own religion in the game, now seen too many adventure modules or supplements based on this concept, so I suppose GMs normally block players who dare go that way) I went for it and made some rulings on the spot to enable them to make their own religion. It went so good that soon it wasn't them being chased by the factions around the setting, but standing their ground and challenging them. They became another important faction in the setting and forced a better situation than if they had confronted each faction on their stronghold or made all kind of diplomatic moves on them. This was one of the things that made that entire campaign memorable.<br/><br/>The other was a hack I made of Microscope. Out campaign had kept all along the mistery of what had happened with humankind a thousand years ago, as it seems they were more developed than now but went through an apocaliptic event that came to define the current status quo. So, as the PCs visited the ancient ruins of a long lost human city, they faound what had happened. Except that instead of me prepping that and telling them through a long recording making lots of exposition, we played through it.<br/><br/>I had the players make new PCs. Their stats didn't matter, we just stated they were epic top tier characters. They got to make their own equipment. Any sci-fi technology could go. They had giant mecha, orbital lasers, nanobot swarms, etc. We listed them all on separate cards and that was it. Then I randomly handled one behavior condition for each character, more of a "modus operandi", like "you prefer a pacific solution", "you won't accept a pacifical solution", "Your people comes first", "Science and development comes first" and such.<br/><br/>Then they all faced an invasion of interdimensional aliens using whatever they had made up, and rolls informed us about how successful it was against the aliens. They barely stopped the first wave and after the aliens sent an ultimatum, all the PCs gathered through video-conference to coordinate a solution. Here's where their modus operandi (which they kept secret until then) came into play and to our surprise, it went as we figure any international peace conference goes, with people agreeing to disagree, some plans got coordinated and some never came to be, which it all ended up further dooming the whole setting.<br/><br/>It was awesome, better than anything I could have written at that moment. Since then I've been amazed with the potential of content creation the players have when it's properly guided, and the positive effect this has on the game Flow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455492/#Comment_455492" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-04T13:59:37+00:00" title="August  4, 2016  1:59PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love this, and think it's great, but some people absolutely hate it.

I never ever use wide open questions, not even open-ended ones, I ask for the smallest bits of information possible and only after offering something for inspiration or some sort of constrict to guide the players. This isn't your dirty hippie story game and as a GM I've still got plenty of fiat and agency about what part of whatever the players created is true.<br/><br/>And definitely with veteran players, I'd simply add illusionism over the process and not tell them I'm improvising anything. As strange as it sounds it's more or less what happens at my table, though I kinda always end up bragging about how I improvised lots of stuff after the session and so now my group of players just collaborates into keeping the illusion that it could all be prep'd (as some times it still actually is)<br/><br/>From 1-10 speaking in how veteran/old school are my group of players, I'd say they are at 8. They have never been really interested in trying story games, but I've been using all kind of tricks hacked from story games into our trad games campaigns, yet sparingly. So it's not like they are full time dirty hippie story gamers now, nor creativity machines. They just freeze less when asked for, say, what their character thinks a rumour related to a monster attacking people could be referring to. (this is exactly how it went in our last session, player just answered it could be related to X evil god, something that hits one of that player's flags)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461709/#Comment_461709" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-05T17:10:31+00:00" title="April  5, 2017  5:10PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Raise!<br/><br/>Well, actually just to put <a href="https://resourcefullrpg.wordpress.com/2017/04/04/cooperative-worldbuilding-tool/" rel="nofollow">this link to my blog</a>, where I posted my cooperative world building tool resuming this and other tricks I'm currently using to start my campaigns.

I think I even saw this video before somewhere, probably even got inspired by it. This current iteration of my CWBT is tried an tested, so I can vouch for what this guy says. However, I do like to come up with most of the prep on my own, to give the story more coherence. I like to give consequences time to grow, bring back things they players have created and discarded, build a bit more upon whatever the players have brought to the table and make interesting connections between whatever things they bring to the table.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461758/#Comment_461758" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-06T18:39:21+00:00" title="April  6, 2017  6:39PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2017 6:55PM by adamwb.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've built a lot of this style of play into my OSR rules, including a mandatory, randomly determined, open-ended question put to each new character to answer about their place in the world. But best of all is now we have two high-level clerics with the spell <em>Commune</em> which means that pretty much every week one of them is drawing a new island onto their world map or \u201cdiscovering\u201d a powerful magic artefact in a distant land, once they run out of immediate questions to ask about things that I've already prepped. One of them basically wrote an adventure outline for the whole spring by inventing five locations relevant to another player's <em>Quest</em> (as in the spell where you have to do something or die, which also calls for this same kind of play).<br/><br/>I don't usually do on-the spot dungeons beyond a simple cave system or something like I would for a random encounter, although I do add things to my existing maps. But I make a lot of notes to put things on the edge of my prepped areas, relying on their travel time to buy me a day to do full prep, and now (gosh I've been running this game for five years) I think a majority of the big world-shaking NPCs or enemies are ones that someone made up when they were rolling up a level one years ago.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461761/#Comment_461761" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-06T20:44:28+00:00" title="April  6, 2017  8:44PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This isn't really something I enjoy so I'm happy that the work is being done at other tables. \u2665<br/>Always be testing                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461762/#Comment_461762" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-06T20:51:56+00:00" title="April  6, 2017  8:51PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's great adamwb! And yes, player creations are always the best. Usually all you need is some filtering, mostly to adjust the campaign to what the players expect/want to do.<br/><br/>It might be useful to stall players a bit sometimes. Like, when they come up with something and go to that place, you can always let them waste a bit of time buying things for the travel and throw some obstacles or a random encounter at them along the way, so they reach the place right at the end of the session. That gives you until the next session to prep the place properly if you want to surprise the players and work on lore/tactics a bit more. Otherwise you can count on the players to come up with most of the rest.<br/><br/>Making dungeons on the spot can be tricky depending on what you want. Randomizing rooms and connections may prove chaotic in terms of the function and history of the dungeon. However if you keep at least thematic coherence for the whole dungeon things can go smoother. I'm currently working on the third version of my ResourceFull deck that features 4 random tables that I've found really helpful when improvising dungeons: general shape of the room/corridor, exit, triggers for traps and traps themselves. Add a theme, a random encounter and maybe a puzzle and you can get a really interesting dungeon from these variables.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461766/#Comment_461766" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-06T21:21:02+00:00" title="April  6, 2017  9:21PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also find it a great way to sort of connect the different poles of the D&amp;D tradition specifically\u2014that there is this sort of gonzo attitude and anachronistic jokes, but that can exist and be a player-led space inside of a world where I do lots of work to establish tone and specificity. For instance, I strongly suggest in my players guide that the Cleric is tied to medieval christianity and a central church that nonetheless disagrees with itself about lots of specifics and is very concerned about heresy and veiled political power. But the guide also specifically says that actually, it's not up to me at all\u2014if you have a question about God, ask the cleric you know!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
