Defending the planet from disaster, but longing for a normal life with friends, school, and work. Then you get that chance and it's so much more complicated than your <b>Saved by the Bell</b> video tapes led you to believe!<br/><br/>Or maybe you just suffered a trauma and picked up a bow and arrow to maybe get your life under control again. You use your uncanny talents to keep innocents safe, because you never want anybody to go through what you did.<br/><br/>You're a teenager, but you're a superhero too. You use your great power to fulfill your great responsibility -- whatever that means to you. You do your homework, fight assholes in power armor, and defeat power hungry engineers with death rays. Though that's not going to be easy with cliques, money struggles, and straining friendships all around.</blockquote>\nSo, teenage superheroes in the way of <b>The Spectacular Spider-Man</b> animated series, but with a dash of <b>Runaways</b> darkness and even some <b>Powerpuff Girls</b> and <b>My Life as a Teenage Robot</b> strangeness.<br/><br/>At this point the game looks to be primarily a mashup of Prime Time Adventures, Spookybeans, and a couple bits from Apocalypse World. I'm mostly just trying to make the superhero game that I would want to play.<br/><br/>The game revolves around framing scenes, rolling for narration rights when taking risks, and gathering points to spend on defining details in the "cliffhanger" end-of-act and end-of-episode scenes. Each session is meant to be like an episode in a dramatic cartoon serial, like a Greg Weisman series.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448314/#Comment_448314" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-02T13:25:51+00:00" title="September  2, 2015  1:25PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The concept sounds incredibly cool!<br/>Looks like Monsterhearts but with superheroes instead of horror tropes <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuneiperJazz" title="JuneiperJazz"><img alt="JuneiperJazz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/208/n6T62QR1ZDEGN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuneiperJazz">JuneiperJazz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448321/#Comment_448321" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-02T17:14:14+00:00" title="September  2, 2015  5:14PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's kind of a response to my experiences with Monsterhearts and Smallville. It was originally a Monsterhearts hack, but after the afternoon that I spent scribbling things out it ended up drifting a lot.<br/><br/>What I have so far is pretty rough, but here's a snapshot of what a typical session looks like.<br/><br/>The GM comes to the table with a villainous plot that ties into their season-long arc. This is basically a bite-sized Danger in AW speak. They push this when they get narration rights and set up intermissions. The players come with their PCs and ideas for where they want to take them as well as characters in the world that they want to see. <br/><br/>Play is divided between acts, scenes, and intermissions. There are four acts in an episode and each PC gets one scene per act. Intermissions are details inserted between scenes, and help connect things together. The main currency of the game is tokens, and those can be spent to insert details into scenes or intermissions as they're happening, or when you aren't the focus character (in this case the token goes to the focus character, otherwise it goes into the ether).<br/><br/>When it's your turn to be the center of the scene, you say what the scene is about and who it includes. You establish the set dressing and all that. Then, when your character does something risky, the GM and the scene's focus player roll dice. The GM spends dice from their pool (I'm not sure how they get dice into the pool yet) and the player picks up a die for each character trait that they want to leverage in the action. Odd numbers are successes, evens are duds. Whoever has the most successes gets to narrate the outcome.<br/><br/>When you win narration rights, you get full control over the outcome of your action. When you bring certain things into your narration (a super-villain crashes the scene, your powers put you in a spot, <i>real life</i> puts you in a spot, etc) you gain a token.<br/><br/>In between scenes, the GM may interrupt with an intermission and frame a mini-scene around an NPC. Other players can spend tokens to interrupt with details and reveals and insert characters. If anybody inserts something to do with a thing on your character sheet, you gain a token too. Every episode begins on an intermission and every act ends on one, too. Tokens gained on the very last intermission roll over to the next episode, but not any gained before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448336/#Comment_448336" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-04T02:59:32+00:00" title="September  4, 2015  2:59AM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not a fan of superhero stuff, but the focus on relatable, human issues here catches my attention.

From the introduction on the "about" page, this doesn't really look like something I'd enjoy.

That doesn't bring to mind any particular superhero fiction for me, so you might be breaking some new ground as well as some expectations.  (I've missed plenty over the years, though, so perhaps there's some perfect touchpoint out there and I just don't know it.)  Curious to see how this impacts the superheroics.  (I have no trouble imagining the high school stuff.)<br/><br/>Are you going to use homeroom from Monsterhearts?  Will there be some equivalent epicenter for heroics, like a league or local heroes' lair or something?  Or will there be some habitual conceit like "The teen heroes are all at school, and after they live their teen lives for a bit, a Great Menace arrives to threaten the [locale]!"?\n<blockquote>As a player, I love being able to step in and out of actor and author stances.

Life has been weird and I might need to put this on the backburner for about a month while I get through a rough patch.<br/><br/>I'm not sure it's going to be quite HBO by default. They veer to much into shock value and tits for my tastes. This is more directly related to the tone of certain comics. Like, "Brian K Vaughn's <b><i>X-Men Evolution</i></b>" or "Mark Waid's <i><b>Static Shock</b></i>" (or even just the original <b><i>Static</i></b> run).<br/><br/>Here's how I'm imagining XP and advancement working out...<br/><br/>The game will work on a pretty traditional structure. PTA style scene setup flows into a standard Apocalypse World "say what you do, the GM reacts, moves trigger and snowball" sort of deal.<br/><br/>When you roll a 6 or less, gain 1 XP. When somebody spends a string on you and you accept, gain 1 XP. When a move tells you to, gain XP.<br/><br/>The MC has the hard moves, <b>give them a new condition</b> &amp; <b>advance a condition</b>. The <b>Defy Danger</b> &amp; <b>Shut Someone Down</b> moves also <br/><br/>When you gain a new condition, write it on your sheet. Each condition has 6 boxes and an escape clause. The GM will tell you what you need to doto get rid of it if you ask on a successful <b>Peer Into the Cosmic Storm</b> roll. When the GM chooses to advance a condition, you check off a box and it gets worse. Mark XP at each condition's third box. If you reach the sixth box you get 1 XP, and whatever the condition is leading to happens.<br/><br/>On... let's say 6 XP, you erase it all and take an advance. The advances for The Mask (Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel, Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler) are...\n<ul><li>Gain +1 Savvy... <i>and somebody really likes you, and wants you to know it</i></li><li>Gain +1 Cool... <i>and you get positive attention from another clique</i></li><li>Gain +1 Bang... <i>and a villain is involved with somebody close to you</i></li><li>Gain +1 Cosmic... <i>and you get an opportunity to pursue your passion, with a catch</i></li><li>Gain another Mask move... <i>and you gain an obvious physical change.

That doesn't bring to mind any particular superhero fiction for me, so you might be breaking some new ground as well as some expectations.  (I've missed plenty over the years, though, so perhaps there's some perfect touchpoint out there and I just don't know it.)  Curious to see how this impacts the superheroics.  (I have no trouble imagining the high school stuff.)<br/><br/>Are you going to use homeroom from Monsterhearts?  Will there be some equivalent epicenter for heroics, like a league or local heroes' lair or something?  Or will there be some habitual conceit like "The teen heroes are all at school, and after they live their teen lives for a bit, a Great Menace arrives to threaten the [locale]!"?</blockquote>I'm definitely using the Homeroom. I'm not sure about major superhero establishments, but  there is going to be some structure around the superheroic stuff. It could be stuff in the school (this asshole who likes to punch you got super powers!) or it might intrude into  your other daily life stuff. So there's no clear division.\n<blockquote><blockquote>As a player, I love being able to step in and out of actor and author stances. That's because of my play by post background though, where that's a basic and necessary skill for any game to survive. However, for most people this constant switching and editing and all in the context of a  GM led game is super awkward and I have to respect that. So I think I'm going to dial that back drastically into move outcomes and GM's questions.</blockquote>I would guess you'll reach a broader audience that way.  If you wind up not loving it, though, I'm sure the stance-switching could be made to work with enough up-front orientation.<br/><br/>Personally, I really like the sound of working some traditionally-meta stuff into move outcomes and GM questions!</blockquote>Me too. There is already a bit of that in there though. It is kind of about pushing the lists of choices.\n<blockquote><blockquote>The playbooks are all built around different perspectives and priorities</blockquote>Ah, nice, classic X-Men.

Give me a little time to write this out, because my thoughts on the topic are kind of long.<br/><br/>In any case. I want to keep this theme of transformation that I've been building up.

Where Peter's themes are pretty plainly a cisgender puberty metaphor, Miles's are ostensibly a <b>transgender</b> puberty metaphor.

I like talking about this stuff. Though some of this may be a bit stream of consciousness.<br/><br/>My main frame of reference for Peter's narrative is the Raimi movies, the Weismann cartoon, and some bits of the Ultimate comics.<br/><br/>Okay so, the thing about Peter Parker is that he's bitten by the super-spider, and then he exploits it. Does the wrestling thing (we see how that turns out), meets girls (hel-looo, Black Cat!), and basically just dives into the superhero thing, complete with a Spider-Signal on his belt. In the Ultimate continuity, his reaction to first climbing a wall and sticking to his ceiling is a whispered, "Cool!"<br/><br/>Now, he has to keep this a secret. Otherwise, well, he gets dissected or something. But he's not pressured to. It's completely his choice, because he feels like this is the responsible thing to do or whatever.<br/><br/>Seems legit.<br/><br/>And, sure, it complicates his life. But overall, his story is about Peter growing up and becoming a man. He's all about consequences and coming to terms with responsibility.\n<h3>Compare to Miles</h3>\nMiles is bitten by the super-spider and he's... well, reluctant would be putting it lightly. He's terrified. He hides it away, buries it deep, and just tries to live with it. He doesn't even consider the superhero thing until Peter is dead already, and even then he needs coaxing. He gets into a prestigious prep school, by lottery, and his first thought is, "What about the kids who didn't get in?"<br/><br/>The first thing he says when he climbs up his bedroom wall and sticks to his ceiling is, "Oh no."<br/><br/>If <b><i>Spider-Man</i></b>, the story, is a puberty metaphor -- a stand-in tale for the changes that your body, mind, and roles go through during your teenage years -- then what boy grows facial hair and <i>dreads</i> it? Somebody who isn't a boy at all.<br/><br/>And then, when he does begin to embrace it, people are telling Miles what they think he  is at every turn. SHIELD wants to keep him under supervision, Prowler is turning him into his enforcer, his father is unintentionally saying that he wouldn't love Miles if he had super powers, thus shoving him deeper into the closet -- this conversation in particular sealed it. So many trans kids have had this conversation before.<br/><br/>If we treat his costumed identity as his transgender identity, and his secret identity as his closet then this seems like exactly what Brian Micheal Bendis is signalling so strongly in this scene, and that especially fits in with the careful flipping around of the Spider-Man formula in Miles's initial arcs.<br/><br/>Miles's story is all about identity, figuring out who he is and developing into somebody who can live his live with integrity. "What is the responsible thing?" is a part of that, but figuring out exactly who he needs to be, who he needs to <b>be responsible to</b> (including himself), is the main thrust.<br/><br/>His own self-conception -- this idea of who Miles Morales is, who Spider-Man is, and where they meet -- is constantly changing. He's constantly <b>transforming</b> into a different person, entirely fluid to the effects of the world around him but doing so in a way that, by the end, keeps his essential "Miles-ness," that kid who asked "What about the kids who didn't get in?"<br/><br/>And he goes through hell for it, sure. But for all the pain, he's all the more Miles in the end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448708/#Comment_448708" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-23T23:46:24+00:00" title="September 23, 2015 11:46PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 23, 2015 11:48PM by David_Berg.">edited September 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lotta great points there!

Transformative, maybe, but formative, no.  I think this is the product of shared creativity in general, multi-protagonist casts in particular, and a certain thread of story-focused RPG design on top of that.  <br/><br/>Like, when I'm making my character in Sorcerer, first I figure out roughly who they are and what they can do, and <i>then</i> I figure out their present quandary, a quandary which must (as per the rules) hinge on <i>other people</i>.  I'm probably going to invent a quandary that is going to allow my character to put who-they-are-now to the test, and the other people involved are probably going to be antagonists or otherwise active agents who keep the struggle external.  "I have just acquired sorcerous powers and bound my first demon and I'm not sure who I am now," is not really supported in the way that "I use demonic powers for X and am in conflict with people/person Y" is.  The crises of play are supposed to make you (as your character) choose, and in so doing, reveal things about yourself -- maybe who you are now, maybe who you've been all along, whatever.  So identity exploration is there, but it's the "maybe" and the "whatever" that keep it from being a focus of player attention, especially re: <i>changing</i> identity.<br/><br/>I think this is a very logical way to approach drama, and Apocalypse World and Monsterhearts proceed similarly.  We have our characters and they are cool and we are eager to show and explore their coolness.  Then the GM comes up with some people who are trying to kill them, take their stuff, or otherwise threaten what they value.  Go!  By the time we really know who your character is now, we've probably spent a lot of time forging and changing relationships between the PCs, rolling dice, killing stuff, planning what to do next, etc.  Probably not a lot of quiet moments where one PC gets to fill up some thought bubbles with their internal issues.<br/><br/>If I were going to use a current system for an exploration of identity-formation, I'd probably use Primetime Adventures, which puts an "issue" front and center as the core reason to care about the character.  Whether they're good at ninjitsu or mind-control or whatever is pretty clearly secondary, and the GM's adversity is supposed to be tailored specifically to their "issue" (something Sorcerer also does, and in that respect I like it more than MH).  A PtA game where every "issue" was "coming to grips with powers" might be a blast, or perhaps it might be necessary to specify further to properly inspire GMs -- "coming to grips with not being normal" or "coming to grips with being able to kill with impunity" or whatever quandary a given character's powers present.<br/><br/>Maybe that's still not enough, though.  Maybe we need some "before" time, getting to know who the characters were before any powers entered the picture.  This sort of prologue play is something I often lobby for in various games and it's a tough sell!  Few gamers I know have enough spare gaming time to conquer the "get to the point" urge.<br/><br/>Brainstorm: what I'd do is pitch a game to players by saying "powers will happen to you!"  And, just like anything else that happens to you, you don't get to choose them.  So, when you're investing that time and thought and emotion in creating a character, you're creating a person who has to be interesting for reasons other than their powers and their escaped arch enemy.  The char-gen guidance would be about making someone who already has things they care about and goals they're invested in (maybe as a PtA-style "issue") before any powers enter the picture.  The first few hours (sessions?) would be about these people and these issues and pursuits.  And then -- BAM!  The GM gives this PC wings, and this PC laser eyes, and this PC invisibility, and... what <i>now</i>, y'all?<br/><br/>My inspirational reference would certainly not be Avengers, probably not even X-Men, but rather the movie <i>Chronicle</i>, about 3 friends who stumble on a superpower source and proceed to fuck up their lives with their newfound abilities.  <br/><br/>Of course, if the <i>characters</i> in the game want to play Avengers, then cool, we can have capes and heroism and other supers trappings, that's up to them -- but we're still playing for the <i>purpose</i> of exploring their "issues", and the GM is pushing on those, whether its with funny-costumed villains or with overdue loans and family illness.<br/><br/>I realize I've wandered off the "as metaphor" part of growing-up heroes and taken it in a pretty explicit direction, but that's where I was inspired to go by your description of Miles Morales (whose story I have not (yet!) read).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuneiperJazz" title="JuneiperJazz"><img alt="JuneiperJazz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/208/n6T62QR1ZDEGN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuneiperJazz">JuneiperJazz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448724/#Comment_448724" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-24T15:49:46+00:00" title="September 24, 2015  3:49PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm. You bring up PtA issues and that is a great piece of tech that really helped my few games of PtA flourish. I think it would be worthwhile to steal that.<br/><br/>I think that the externalization is kind of necessary in RPGs, though. Whenever people do primarily internalized conflict, it locks other people out and makes everything harder to perform. This is especially apparent in play-by-post, but is equally a problem in any game where the players are expected to have agency. Other players lose their primary hook, your externalized action, to interact with them. And so, everybody ends up playing a different game with bits of crossover. This works in solo play, but not where interaction with the other PCs is part of the point.<br/><br/>Having before-time without your powers seems like a pretty great way to open and establish the characters as people with issues first. I'm not sure about having powers happen <i>to</i> you though. Part of what makes <b><i>Marvel Heroic</i></b>, and most good superhero fiction, work is that <b>powers are fun</b>. Part of that is the player being able to take powers that interest them and that they can work into their descriptions.<br/><br/>I think that pushing how those powers change afterward, maybe off of a random table, might work as a middle ground. When you successfully deal with a condition, roll on this set of tables for how your power set is changed, but if you suffered the condition's end state roll on another set of tables.<br/><br/>Hum. I might make a system for constructing keys, using PtA and Dramasystem bits as a starting point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448726/#Comment_448726" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-24T16:08:46+00:00" title="September 24, 2015  4:08PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave,<br/><br/>Agreed on all points.

And for that reason, when you give my character powers, I am sure as hell going to have fun with them!  But I'm perfectly comfortable having to bring that attitude to a set of constraints, rather than demanding my pick from the candy shop.  *shrug*  There are plenty of other games out there where I can pick my powers.  If I care about flight or super-strength, you can bet I've had them already.<br/><br/>I mean, a GM making up powers out of the blue could be bad, but a book full of good, well-designed powers should keep the fun.  Maybe have the players read through it pre-game and each nix a few they think they wouldn't enjoy.<br/><br/>Not trying to convince you re: Freaks; more just testing the argument, as I might run with this myself...\n<blockquote>When you successfully deal with a condition, roll on this set of tables for how your power set is changed, but if you suffered the condition's end state roll on another set of tables.</blockquote>This also sounds pretty awesome to me.  I can see this working as either a "in this world, powers constantly mutate!" conceit, or in a framework of "at its essence, your power is what it is, but what you learn to <i>do</i> with it is a product of your circumstances, choices, etc."\n<blockquote>I think that the externalization is kind of necessary in RPGs, though . . . Other players lose their primary hook, your externalized action, to interact with them. And so, everybody ends up playing a different game with bits of crossover.</blockquote>This was my reaction when I was first introduced to the idea that "the PCs are <i>not</i> an adventuring party" and might not spend the whole game together.  And I was right!  But often enough, play has been fun anyway.  It's not foolproof -- the Driver in Apocalypse World is a complete interaction-killer unless the Fronts push everyone onto the road -- but it seems like plenty of gamers are happy to accept the bad with the good.<br/><br/>So that's my take on internal conflict.  Get people to care enough about each other's character issues, and sitting and listening for a bit is actually quite familiar.<br/><br/>That said, I have no objection to turning doubts and fears into demons or whatnot...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448746/#Comment_448746" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-25T02:40:57+00:00" title="September 25, 2015  2:40AM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sorry to bring up <i>Worm</i> again, but it has kind of a neat take on this. Superpowers manifest when a person goes through some kind of trauma (although for some, it's remarkably minor trauma, like being cast out of a popular group at school), and the powers tend to be related in some way to what happened. People who are hurt physically often develop physical/dangerous powers, for example.<br/><br/>However, it's possible (but rare) to go through a second traumatic moment and develop further powers (which, rather, tend to change or diversify the powers you have, not in a particularly well-understand way, because it's so rare*).<br/><br/>It would be very interesting to have a mechanic like this in place - as the character achieves certain goals or suffers certain defeats, their powers change (maybe not for the better, depending on how optimistic or tragic you want this to be - perhaps powers that are more destructive tend to get stronger with time, whereas constructive, benign powers like healing tend to get weaker, encouraging certain excesses in their use over time). This can be built into a mechanic which allows feedback from the player to the GM/group and back as the game develops.<br/><br/>Changing playbooks (Skins) in Monsterhearts accomplishes this to some degree, but I think it could be done much better than that.<br/><br/>I also really *like* the idea of authoring a difficult situation for a very human character and then being given an unknown power or set of powers (outside of my control).<br/><br/>On one hand, there's the curiosity/fun of discovering what the powers are (you might not know without experimenting - are you brave enough to injure yourself to see if you are invulnerable or if you have healing powers?). On the other hand, there is the interesting fun of having to deal with a difficult situation (e.g. your marriage is falling apart) with an entirely unsuitable super power (the ability to spit acid and poisons).<br/><br/>Both sound pretty cool to me.<br/><br/><br/>*: In <i>Worm</i>, superpowers are somewhat well-understood, largely due to social media and internet speculation. Kids study superheroes in high school, and are made to write essays on relevant issues (or even particularly famous or infamous superheroes) for sociology class or speculative papers for physics class and so forth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuneiperJazz" title="JuneiperJazz"><img alt="JuneiperJazz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/208/n6T62QR1ZDEGN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuneiperJazz">JuneiperJazz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448754/#Comment_448754" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-25T14:11:28+00:00" title="September 25, 2015  2:11PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think these ideas are pushing a bit too much toward deconstruction for my tastes. The random powers are cool, but I don't think that's the direction I want to take this in. I'd rather focus on the dramatic poles of the character and then have the players write powers that plug into or accentuate that.<br/><br/>The whole game is going to be squarely in a sort of "dramatic, older-skewing action cartoon" realm. The characters are part of the setting and they have real issues &amp; struggles. But the narrative ought to leverage the genre rather than deconstruct it or see what it would be like with real world logic. Which is part of what I'm referencing when I mention Vaughn, Waid, &amp; Bendis.<br/><br/>Which is to say, I'm much more interested in the fantasy and allegorical elements, rather than doing a gritty, real world take. Not to say that those are incompatible, but the gritty take is overdone and somewhat antithetic to what I get out of superheroes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448759/#Comment_448759" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-25T19:04:12+00:00" title="September 25, 2015  7:04PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 25, 2015 7:11PM by David_Berg.">edited September 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Makes sense!  I have no interest in gritty for the sake of gritty, it was just incidental; but yeah, I guess my ideas were moving away from fun fantasy.  <br/><br/>I still think that creating some space for internal processing is viable, though.  Most superheroes I can think of have always had thought bubbles aplenty, and teen Peter Parker probably takes the cake.  It seems to me that the other popular solution for building meaning and context between action sequences is to have the heroes talk to each other, but that sort of "here's what's going on inside me" exposition usually produces too much of a forced group therapy vibe for my taste.  I mean, character interaction is key, but specifically for sharing doubts, fears, inner drives, etc., I've always much preferred the thought bubble scenes.<br/><br/>I'll admit to being ignorant of most of the Marvel work by Vaughn, Waid, &amp; Bendis.  I've read those guys' other stuff, but Marvel hero titles mostly lost me with all the reboots of the last 20 years.
