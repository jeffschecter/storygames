We have played a variety of games over the years: boardgames, wargames, sports and RPGs.  We played D&amp;D, Traveller and Runequest around 30 years ago and stopped in the mid to late 80s.  I've told him about my rekindled interest in RPGs, particularly indie games.<br/><br/>Tonight, out of the blue he said that the reason that he couldn't play RPGs were that they weren't competitive.  I told him about running a game of Agon recently but I was wondering if anyone could suggest other competitive RPGs, where players are in competition with each other.  I'd tend towards indie stuff than mainstream.<br/><br/>Thanks<br/>Piers                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346408/#Comment_346408" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-18T16:19:03+00:00" title="October 18, 2011  4:19PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In A Wicked Age is very PvP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346411/#Comment_346411" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-18T16:40:41+00:00" title="October 18, 2011  4:40PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Labyrinths &amp;

Whose mastery of the rules is best?<br/><br/>* We're playing Baron Munchausen. We compete to see who brings the highest level of theatrical flair and excitement to the table! Who will impress the most?<br/><br/>* We're playing a tactical wargame: we match our wits against each other to find out who is the best strategist. Who is smartest? Who can outwit the others?<br/><br/>Most of the games suggested so far... might help scratch one itch, but fail entirely at another.

The Corporal kicks a lot of ass, and will almost always get the most kills (you automatically 'level up' by having the most kills in a given mission) due to his crazy weapon. But the Sergeant outranks him--nothing is stopping the Sergeant from ordering the Corporal to turn over his weapon. Nothing is stopping the the Troopers from forcing the Corporal to make poor tactical choices (via overzealous use of grenades, or their special ability 'Force Weakness').<br/><br/>So there is PVP there, but it's sort of subtle and you're not really allowed to be open about it ("Do you know what the chain of command is? It's the chain I beat you with..."). If you're playing a short one-shot type game, most players won't think to fuck with each other. As the game progresses, though, it becomes more obvious that you should maybe cock the other players about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346434/#Comment_346434" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-18T23:35:03+00:00" title="October 18, 2011 11:35PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 20, 2011 12:03AM by Rafu.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.berengad.com/bh/" rel="nofollow">Beast Hunters</a> by Christian &amp; Lisa Griffen is a role-playing game designed for real competition, with honor and good sportsmanship in mind.<br/><br/>For contrast, the amount of so called "pvp" in a <i>Fiasco</i> or <i>In a Wicked Age</i> game is <b>not</b> really competition, bur rather a particularly aggressive attitude you take <i>within an assumed and well-established context of cooperation</i>.

The majority of games mentioned here are not really competitive. Not in the way a board-gamer would mean when they use the word. If you play it to win, The Shab al-Hiri Roach, Baron Munchausen, 3:16, and In a Wicked Age WILL break. These aren't really competitive games. They're great games (the Roach is one of my all-time favorites!), but they're not competitive. If the players try to win, the game will suck.<br/><br/>While I think it's not impossible, I have yet to see a game that includes "clouds to dice" rules that manages to pass the Rising test: "The most effective way of playing should be the most fun". If your game passes that test, odds are it's a solid competitive game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_346561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus" title="The_Magus (Banned)"><img alt="The_Magus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus">The_Magus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346561/#Comment_346561" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-20T17:01:40+00:00" title="October 20, 2011  5:01PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Do you have a sense of what *kind* of competitive element your friend is looking for?<br/><br/>* We're playing a tactical wargame: we match our wits against each other to find out who is the best strategist.

I haven't read or played BE. Question: does it have any "cloud-to-dice" rules? That is, does the fiction affect the mechanics at all?<br/><br/>Supercrew is a game that's pretty rules-light, but has a bit of strategy in it, and you can't break it by playing to win. Also, D&amp;D4 is pretty competitive once we're in combat mode, yes? The one time I played it, we sort of skipped the parts between combat with GM narration of what our characters did, with a bit of roleplaying added on for flavor, and occasional skill checks. Then we got to a fight and played it much as a board game. It was pretty fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346618/#Comment_346618" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-21T14:20:54+00:00" title="October 21, 2011  2:20PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Simon">@Simon</a>: if you, for example, go check the long [not so] old thread about how Eero plays D&amp;D, you'll see a totally competitive game, a game of strategy and tactics, built mostly on "cloud to dice", even on "clouds to clouds" rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346626/#Comment_346626" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-21T16:56:15+00:00" title="October 21, 2011  4:56PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Old-school D&amp;D (which is basically what Eero is doing) I would say IS a game of strategy and tactics... but I don't know if I would call it competitive, per se.

Judgments based on fictional considerations have been part of hardcore wargaming since its invention. This is what Judges did in the classic German military training exercises, and many tactical tabletop wargames employ a Referee to make mechanical rulings based on fictional circumstances.<br/><br/>"Cloud-to-dice" doesn't inhibit competitive play at all.<br/><br/>Also, consider the importance of proper role-play in those scenarios. Even if it's possible, it's not <i>proper</i> for a player to issue guerilla warfare commands to his Napoleonic army during a battle. Doing so might increase his chances of winning in the absolute sense, but would be out of bounds for play, whether or not a "no guerilla actions" rule was in place.<br/><br/>I think, (too often among gamers) "competitive" is taken to mean, "exploit everything to your advantage <i>with no other considerations</i>," which is, of course, ridiculous. No competitive contest in the real world is carried out that way.<br/><br/>This is where "playing to win makes the game suck" comes from. That person who is making the game suck isn't playing the game. They're playing some kind of simplified, Xs and Os abstract, instead, and ignoring or minimizing the game elements that give context and structure to the tactical play (because that structure and context require their tactical play to be more nuanced and challenging, which they want to avoid).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348068/#Comment_348068" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-06T01:39:37+00:00" title="November  6, 2011  1:39AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/todd">@todd</a> <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=17796.0;wap2" rel="nofollow">Mexican Standoff</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348073/#Comment_348073" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-06T02:19:51+00:00" title="November  6, 2011  2:19AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>I think, (too often among gamers) "competitive" is taken to mean, "exploit everything to your advantage<i>with no other considerations</i>," which is, of course, ridiculous.

I've won one of this sort in two different big play wargames now (nice medal for the one last night actually) and once in a Wodehouse-themed LARP co-GMed by John Kim.<br/><br/>It's a social nicety, and something designers might want to consider if designing competitive RPGs. John Harper brings up some of the reasons why in his post.<br/><br/>I know that RPGers in particular seem to have a bit of a rough time when faced with the thought of  judging other players on their play ( and, more importantly, being judged themselves!). Still, if grognardly old wargames can and do recognize how important this aspect is to successful/enjoyable gaming, it might be something worth considering adding in.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Actually, wargamers, especially of the minis using variety often offer awards in multiple categories beyond battlefield victor, including recognition awards for the hobby aspects ( whose toys looked the coolest) and scenario design (mostly for the GMs, so that they finally get some recognition as well). As for the MVP award, that's kinda there to recognize that sometimes, even with weighted victory conditions, some players will be badly out-classed almost from the get-go. Playing well,possibly even in character when it means utter defeat as opposed to rules mongering for a squeaky win and general helpfilness is considered as important for a functional ame experience. You may not be able to win, but your attitude in the face of that does make a difference in the games enjoyment by all players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348118/#Comment_348118" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-06T15:17:30+00:00" title="November  6, 2011  3:17PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Robbins</cite><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>I think, (too often among gamers) "competitive" is taken to mean, "exploit everything to your advantage<i>with no other considerations</i>," which is, of course, ridiculous.

GM thing, and old-skool dungeon crawls with the GM as impartial arbiter of the players' attempts to overcome the traps and monsters are great - a lot of my competitive friends find this kind of challenge-oriented play a lot of fun.  <br/><br/>The key element is that the game should minimize the need to choose between creating cool fiction and increasing your chances of winning.  I am aware that every game has some degree of sportsmanship, but I really think it's a perverse set of incentives to continually pit the thing that makes story games unique vs. the competitive part.  If you're really playing Shab-al-Hiri roach to win, you'll bring in so many elements each scene to help you that the fiction will lose coherence.  If you're playing IAWA to win then every scene is someone bludgeoning (physically or otherwise) someone else to get what they want.  If you're playing Baron von Munchausen to win, you will never make a challenge.  If you're really playing Burning Empires to win, not only will you be endlessly bumping up against the lack of specificity about how different forces are outfitted, but the choices the players and GM make will be boring as they continually attempt to all gang up to put important npcs permanently out of commission. <br/><br/>All of these scenarios I've described have happened in games I've played in.  They're all games I like, in some cases games I love.  The fact that there's a winner and a loser focuses and motivates play.  But if the players are too interested in winning in these games, they don't function right.  If your friend wants to play rpgs that are competitive because he's a competitive gamer, don't show him games that offer victory as a goal to move play in a certain direction; look for ones where strategic play contributes positively to the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348148/#Comment_348148" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-06T18:20:30+00:00" title="November  6, 2011  6:20PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, could you please explain how Murderous Ghosts is a competitive game?

It does depend on your draws, but you can mitigate the effect of bad draws by timing your discards well and managing when you bust. Also, the actions you choose to take play a big role. For instance, hiding from the ghosts is generally a bad idea.<br/><br/>Vincent says he can win 3 out of 4 games usually, but I'm not at that level.<br/><br/>Ignotus: That thing you said about bringing in so many elements in a Roach scene that it loses coherence? I call that "being a shitty player." Since the game is both competitive <b>and an RPG</b>, being bad at the RPG part means you're a crap player. "Winning" and being a crap player is possible, yes, but it's not as good as both winning and being an awesome player, right?<br/><br/>The people who are really playing the game will hone their skills and adapt their tactics so they can do the latter, because that's where the <i>actual</i> competition is happening. The person who "wins" by being a shitty RPGer just gets eyerolls. Anyone can do <i>that</i>. There's no challenge there, and thus no glory in achieving it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348183/#Comment_348183" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-07T06:21:12+00:00" title="November  7, 2011  6:21AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 7, 2011 6:22AM by Ludanto.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also <a href="http://www.museoffire.com/Games/about.html" rel="nofollow">Capes</a>.
