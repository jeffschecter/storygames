In addition to all the neat things already in SOTC, Bill always adds in his own touches.  These included game mechanics for building and then racing Rex Rich\xe2\u20ac\u2122s rocket-plane.  Building the rocket plane required a series of linked challenges:  resources roll to fund improvements to the workshop, \xe2\u20ac\u02dcweird science\xe2\u20ac\u2122 stunt to design the rocket, and then engineering (modified by science) to build it.  The plane itself had two characteristics, speed and performance, that the designer (Snap Redstone) could adjust by trading one for the other.  Snap (played by Karin) designed a slow(er) but maneuverable rocket-plane.  In our race against \xe2\u20ac\u0153Go Go Goddard\xe2\u20ac\u2122s\xe2\u20ac\x9dAmerican Eagle prototype, we flew a down and back oval that was a total of eighty zones in length.  On the straightaways, each pilot took a modified \xe2\u20ac\u02dcsprint\xe2\u20ac\u2122 action\xe2\u20ac\u201dthe pilot skill roll, plus the aircraft\xe2\u20ac\u2122s speed, determined the number of zones the plane moved.  At the turnaround, the plane\xe2\u20ac\u2122s \xe2\u20ac\u02dcperformance\xe2\u20ac\u2122 rating added to the pilot roll to help beat the obstacle for the turn.  Our race was neck and neck all the way to the turnaround--at high cost in Fate points-- but Snap\xe2\u20ac\u2122s decision to go for maneuverability paid off as the  \xe2\u20ac\u02dcAspiration\xe2\u20ac\u2122 zoomed tightly around the pylons while the American Eagle made a wide, sweeping turn that lost ground.  Aspiration built up such a lead that even the abduction of Snap Redstone from the pilot seat by the Futurian\xe2\u20ac\u2122s teleporter ray didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t throw the race.  But I digress\xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/>I especially enjoyed things such as temporary aspects \xe2\u20ac\u0153++++ Resources roll\xe2\u20ac\x9d after a successfel short sell in the stock market, which funded improvements to the Rich Aviation workshop that allowed us to build the rocket-plan, to win the race, and win the Navy contract!  <br/>Mel                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83739/#Comment_83739" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-27T20:41:53+00:00" title="July 27, 2007  8:41PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The little mechanical fillip I was proudest of, oddly enough, came at the beginning of the game. I made each player rank the five characters in order of preference, and only Rex Rich was chosen by more than one player. Since the next unassigned character (Jack Redstone) was ranked 3rd by one player (Ami) and the 5th by the other (Mel), Mel got Rex and Ami got Jack. This meant that most players got their 1st choice, and no one got worse than their 3rd choice, thereby maximizing player happiness with their characters, at least at start. <br/><br/>But if I run this again, I'll tighten up some things and flesh out others: the rocket plane race needs to be the very first thing, with construction done by Snap's player as a flashback, and its speed of completion determining the quality of the competition, for example.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to running more SOTC, definitely. Next year, a double feature: "The Redstone Bros. in 'The Swamps of Venus'" and "Hub City Confidential, starring Max Mensch, Private Eye."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84014/#Comment_84014" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-30T08:05:18+00:00" title="July 30, 2007  8:05AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By the way, New Brunswick's official nickname is Hub City.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
