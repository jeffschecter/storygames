She can survive damage that should have been fatal, and she can heal any wounds by sleeping them off (for, like, days) in a sort of coma in which her vital signs are diminished enough that you'd think she was dead unless you hooked her up to an EKG.  She fights crime in the bloody bridal dress &amp; veil that she was murdered in.<br/><br/>So, here's what I know about her backstory:<br/>She was murdered on her wedding night, by her husband (she didn't know at the time that it was him).  She survived, thus first discovering her power, and set about on a course for revenge, which led her to her husband.  So she showed up in the wedding dress, which scared him, then she cornered him and advanced menacingly, despite the fact that he emptied a clip on her, which scared <i>the hell</i> out of him.  And she, y'know, killed him.<br/><br/>Here's what I don't know:<br/>Why might a man murder his wife on their wedding night?  And how would he get away with it?<br/><br/>How does a woman escape from the grave without being trained by Pai Mei?<br/><br/>How does this character make the shift from revenge against her husband to fighting crime?  I imagine that she'd appoint herself as a champion of victimized women, but how does she end up fighting organized crime (which is what the game is about)?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185222/#Comment_185222" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-29T15:23:06+00:00" title="December 29, 2008  3:23PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So she's Resurrection Maria, and she's from Juarez, where the deranged narcotrafficantes dupe innocent girls from good country families, throw a big party, marry them, deflower them, murder them, and dump their bodies in the Sonora with impunity.

There's no reason why that couldn't be hacked later to other settings, but this game hasn't even been tested yet; need a foundation before hacking.<br/>Also, judging by your judgment ("retarded comic book stuff") you could very well be in the target audience for this thing.  If you can imagine, say, <i>Darkman</i> reimagined by someone like Raymond Chandler, that's sort of what I'm going for.  Grey world, villains are extensions of that grey, heroes see it in black and white, and the heroes are always scarier than the villains.<br/><br/>Judd,<br/>I like that.  Except, no super villains.  Just organized crime.  <br/>I was initially thinking I wanted her murder to be more violent (<i>initially</i> initially I wanted her to be disfigured under her veil, but I realized that would make the secret identity issue too complicated).  <br/><br/>Josh,<br/>For this particular game, I need to know these details of her past first, or else she's not really playable.  There's some important stats that are derived from this sort of thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/daw65" title="daw65"><img alt="daw65" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/daw65">daw65</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185308/#Comment_185308" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-30T11:13:30+00:00" title="December 30, 2008 11:13AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mary was a Southern debuttante, all innocence and naivete.
