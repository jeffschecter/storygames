It was a four-player game. We are primarily board gamers; the other three people I played with actually have a bit more RPG experience than I do, but over the past few months we\u2019ve played a few games of Fiasco, so this wasn\u2019t our story-driven RPG.<br/><br/>For those unfamiliar, Our Last Best Hope is a story game focused on a major cataclysmic disaster that only your elite team can hope to defeat. You and your teammates are \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 \u201cOur Last Best Hope.\u201d <br/><br/>The game is very free-form, allowing you to come up with whatever major disaster you want. But there are playsets for three main types of disasters, each of which have multiple potential factors, which can be determined randomly or by group decision. We chose the space disaster and used dice to determine the other factors. (The other two playsets revolve around snow and zombies.)<br/><br/>Here\u2019s the basic setup for our game:<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>The Crisis:</b></span> what we are trying to stop/prevent (determined by selecting one of four rolled dice)<br/><i>Deep space exploration has alerted hostile aliens to Humanity\u2019s existence.</i><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>The Limit:</b></span> why our team \u2013 and ONLY our team \u2013 is the right one for the job (determined by selecting one of four rolled dice)<br/><i>The team members have been experimentally enhanced to survive the trip.</i><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>The Plan:</b></span> what we are going to do to stop the crisis (this is NOT determined by dice \u2013 we make it up)<br/><i>Overtake and destroy scout ship via internal sabotage. </i><br/><br/>So, basically, we were all on an outpost in deep space. An alien scout ship came by and scanned us. We knew that they meant bad news not just for our outpost but for all of Earth. Before the game started, the outpost had fought back, damaging the scout ship \u2013 in particular its communications channels. So, the ship could not alert the rest of the evil aliens, but it was getting away. So, our team was sent after it. (The whole \u201cexperimentally enhanced\u201d did not come up much in the game, but it was assumed that of everyone on the outpost, only the four of us would survive.)<br/><br/>Next came character creation. We each chose a role (Doctor, Engineer, Scientist or Soldier) and created our backstories. Much of our characters\u2019 backstories were based around specific elements the game required us to choose (this feature worked very well, IMHO). Specifically, each player had to write down the following for his/her character:<br/>* A fear (passed to and known by the player on your right)<br/>* A secret (passed to and known by the player on your left)<br/>* Two touchstones (something the character brought with him/her and something he/she left behind \u2013 these were public knowledge)<br/>* Another PC who drove the character crazy<br/>* Another PC who kept the character sane<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jda1974" title="jda1974"><img alt="jda1974" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jda1974">jda1974</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391261/#Comment_391261" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-24T19:30:03+00:00" title="September 24, 2012  7:30PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here were our characters:<br/><br/><i><b>Captain Sebastian Lockwood</b></i> (me) \u2013 a James Bond-style soldier (at least in his own mind). His secret was that he was the one who had been sending Lucinda, the ship\u2019s engineer, all of those creepy \u201csecret admirer\u201d notes. She, in fact, was the one crew member who kept him sane. Driving him crazy was the DN4TN, the ship\u2019s android doctor, which made sense because his Sebastian\u2019s fear was robots, androids and other \u201cnon-humans.\u201d He had brought with him liquid stimulant injections, and he\u2019d left behind \u201cthe child she claimed was his.\u201d <br/><br/><i><b>Lt. Lucinda Cooke</b></i> was a McGyver-style engineer. She was afraid of being stalked/followed (the player wrote that without knowing my character\u2019s stalker-y secret). Lucinda had secretly been sent by the outpost commander to collect some tech off of the alien ship. DN4TN was the one on the ship who kept her sane, and \u201cFreight Train\u201d was the one who drove her crazy. She\u2019d brought with her her lucky old-Earth screwdriver, and she\u2019d left behind her dying father.<br/><br/><i><b>DN4TN (a.k.a. \u201cDan Fortune\u201d)</b></i> was the ship\u2019s android doctor. Despite being an android, he had perhaps the biggest heart of everyone aboard; his secret was the he was not overly enthusiastic about the plan to destroy the alien ship because he did not want to harm the aliens \u2013 he would follow orders, but was conflicted. He had a fear of guns, a fear brought out by \u201cFreight Train,\u201d who drove Dan crazy. Lucinda kept Dan sane and they would develop a friendship over the course of the game. Dan brought with him an overwhelming need to keep humans safe, and he left behind extra power cells.<br/><br/><i><b>Roy \u201cFreight Train\u201d Maguffin</b></i> was a burly, no-nonsense soldier, fond of guns, shooting and not much else. His secret was the genetic modifications had made him unstable, and he was afraid of being a disappointment to his family. Lucinda kept him sane, and Dan drove him crazy. He\u2019d brought with him a cache of fine Cuban cigars, and he\u2019d left behind his dear old mom.<br/><br/>Also on the trip were the following assets:<br/>* BALC (the Big-Ass Laser Cannon)<br/>* Cloaking device<br/>* Resurrection stim<br/>* Weapons cache<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jda1974" title="jda1974"><img alt="jda1974" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jda1974">jda1974</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391262/#Comment_391262" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-24T19:30:25+00:00" title="September 24, 2012  7:30PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first scene involved the captain telling the team that there was a complication with the plan \u2013 something was loose on the ship and it might hurt the crew! Apparently, the aliens had planted some sort of hostile creature, which the ships sensors could only detect part of the time, leaving the crew vulnerable. We were close enough to the outpost that we could have turned around and gotten a new ship, but they would have lost precious time \u2013 so we chose to soldier on, just being wary of the creature on board. (Halfway through the game, we\u2019d find out that this was apparently the wrong choice \u2013 the ship was damaged and we lost two of our assets.)<br/><br/>During Act 1, the crew dealt with several threats, resolving all of them handily without taking any Harm. Threats included a massive alien derelict hurtling towards the ship, dodging space debris, a fire and more. Many secrets were also revealed, including the captain\u2019s no-longer-secret admiration of Lucinda and his burgeoning jealousy over Lucinda\u2019s friendship with Dan, the android.<br/><br/>In Act 2, this started getting rough. The creature the aliens had left on board had a teleportation device, which allowed a larger alien boarding party to get onto the ship. The captain was killed saving Lucinda, thus fulfilling his fated death. After him, Dan fell and then Freight Train. Freight Train was actually killed by an alien baby left behind by the boarding party \u2013 as a joke, I\u2019d added an extra Threat card saying \u201ca misplaced infant\u201d (a reference to our last Fiasco game); a fellow player had actually selected that card, updating it to read \u201ca misplaced alien infant with laser-beam eyes.\u201d<br/><br/>Lucinda was the last one standing \u2013 and our last best hope! She did manage to save the day, though, teleporting over to the other ships, destroying the aliens, and making her way back without being killed. We actually had a very high roll at the end (far above the maximum), but she was the only one left alive to celebrate!<br/><br/>**********<br/><br/>All in all this was a fun game. It was a little rocky at times because of getting used to the die rolls, but I think next time will go smoother. I really liked the various touchstones, secrets, fears, and crazy and sane cards \u2013 they helped really tie the game mechanics to the role-playing.<br/><br/>There are some handy character sheets from the publisher\u2019s website. These were great and were a great player aide for things like touchstones, powers and harm indicators. The only real drawback to these was that they offered some tips for resolving threats/combat at the bottom \u2013 great in theory, but some of the descriptions were a little off from what the rules stated (costs for supporting roles and determining black/white events seem off). So, I think that was a little confusing for the other players since they hadn\u2019t read the rules, but we made our way through without too much trouble.<br/><br/>One player thought it took a little too long to get through our setup and character generation, but he enjoyed the game once we started playing. I think that setup and character gen will almost certainly be faster next time, so that wasn\u2019t a huge issue.<br/><br/>Fun game. If you like story games and disaster movies, you should play it!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/m_busuttil" title="m_busuttil"><img alt="m_busuttil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/m_busuttil">m_busuttil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391374/#Comment_391374" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-25T20:04:57+00:00" title="September 25, 2012  8:04PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 25, 2012 8:05PM by m_busuttil.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [deleted accidental double-post.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/m_busuttil" title="m_busuttil"><img alt="m_busuttil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/m_busuttil">m_busuttil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391375/#Comment_391375" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-25T20:04:57+00:00" title="September 25, 2012  8:04PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, this is a bit of an awkward first post.

Here were the things that stumped us a bit:<br/><br/>* Left column, under "if someone else is taking the threat, you can," for the first bullet -- Unless I misunderstand the rules, I think that one person can support the threat-taker for free, and all other supporters must pay 1SP. The wording here makes it sound like everyone must pay 1SP to support.<br/><br/>* In the right column, when talking about "5 above" and "5 below" (5th bullet for "act one" and 3rd bullet for "act two") -- My understanding of Black Events and White Events (and, again, I very well may be wrong!) is that there is automatically 1 Event just for having a higher black or white total. Additional events get added for every 5 above or below. So, for instance, a roll of Black 6 would be two events (one for just being on the black side, and one for being 5 above). The way I read the cheat sheet, it sounds like it would count a Black 6 as just one event.<br/><br/>Anyway, those were the two minor things we caught.
