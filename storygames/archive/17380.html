I work 11:00pm to 7:30am and sleep 9-5. I am off work Monday nights and Tuesday nights. At around Midnight Eastern time I am usually sitting around wishing I had someone to play Apocalypse World with or Don't Rest Your Head or Dungeon World. Can anyone suggest a resource where I could find people who either share my strange hours or live somewhere that they are awake when I am and get a dose of story gaming in? I actually tried just getting on Google Hangouts but it was people who were not gamers chatting about random stuff. Not for me. I want my Gunlugger to jump out a second story window raining bullets on his enemies and kicking ass not talking about what some celebrity is doing.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
