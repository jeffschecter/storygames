All my own opinions on the topic have been covered there already, in terms of the "why it might be this way".  And that's all good and well.<br/><br/>But what I'm <i>really</i> interested in is "how could it be different?"<br/><br/>One of my first thoughts on this was, when I next have an alpha (post-draft, in-playtest) version of Game X, to say "You can have this, but only if you promise in a public place you frequent to discuss your thoughts on it (in that space), and send me an email showing you stating your intention to do this."<br/><br/>So, you could post on your blog "I'm going to get a copy of Game X.  I'll be talking about that tommorrow." - and by showing me you said that, <i>you'd get a copy of Game X</i>.  Which indicates that you've commited something, even if it's only slight embarassment at not doing it.  And it means that you are marketing my thing for me.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/><b>What I want in this thread, if you're wiling:</b>  Ways to make this work if you don't think it does, or to make it work better.

The big issue with free games is that somebody needs to market that thing, but if you're not being paid to sell it, why would you bother? Cutting out the middle-man and having the interested players do the marketing themselves to get more interested players sounds completely doable for me. You could extend this by giving different options, like if somebody promises to run the game at a convention, that's the only way of getting a print copy out of you.<br/><br/>Just be sure to put out some public talking-points material for your game so that the initial discussion has some variety and content aside from how I need to post a thread to get that game out of you. If nothing else, make some theoretical/cultural claims about how your game is better or different than others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179183/#Comment_179183" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T12:45:25+00:00" title="November 18, 2008 12:45PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>If nothing else, make some theoretical/cultural claims about how your game is better or different than others.</blockquote>\nSo, basically, are we talking about a meme?<br/><br/>Like...<br/><br/><b>Game X is (fairly relaxed attempt to sell you on game, just basic information and author's <i>intent</i>).<br/><br/>If you want Game X, repost this to your journal / a forum / other public site where you hang out, and email a link for your post to bob@bob.co.

Rather, try something like asking a bunch of questions that your game answers in a certain way, and encourage the person to post the questions, his personal answers, and the fact that he's going to dive into your game to find out what you think.<br/><br/>To coin an example, I have this game I'm writing that is supposed to offer a functional environment for low-pressure, low-prep adventure gaming with children. I might ask the prospective audience what they think makes gaming with children different. Then I might make some bold claim about it, something like how children essentially need to be given the option to be completely passive in the gaming experience for as much as they want, to make the game not feel stressful and to give different children room to develop their own way of interacting with the game. Then I would suggest to the reader that if he wants to check out how my game does this, he should post this question of mine (and ideally a couple of others that approach my game from other angles) and his own take on the issue somewhere and let me know - he'd get the game in exchange, and he'd already have a thread prepared for when he's read the game and is ready to bash it in public.<br/><br/>Essentially, write your own first post for the thread, but leave enough room for the prospective customer to engage with your claims even before they've got their hands on your game itself. This makes for a more interesting dynamic on the forums - it'll get old pretty quick if all of these marketing messages you're encouraging all end up the same...<br/><br/>Actually, instead of structured questions, you could just give a topic - "What is wrong with D&amp;D?" or some such, and ask the person to start a thread about that, with a mention of how they're going to look into this supposedly amazing game Levi made to fix D&amp;D. By giving less structure you make the various threads more interesting, as they won't repeat your own line again and again. Ideally you'll want to give the person writing your marketing email enough material to have something to write about, but also enough room to make the thread they're starting their own.<br/><br/>Also, you probably should make it explicit that the people who get the game from you can give it to others freely - then you get a dynamic where people distribute your game on the forums alongside the discussions, which won't hurt your marketing in the least.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179195/#Comment_179195" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T13:33:37+00:00" title="November 18, 2008  1:33PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eeeeeeeeeekkkkk!!!!!!<br/><br/>No Eero, No!!!!!<br/><br/>From examples close to that approach that I've seen, it almost always goes deeply negative, even for a totally free game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179197/#Comment_179197" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T13:38:41+00:00" title="November 18, 2008  1:38PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, there's a definite chance of backfiring if the target audience feels that you're bribing people to shill for you.

I mean, if it's free, why do you need me to talk about it?  So that more people will ask you for a copy and talk about it, too?  And why would you care if they did?<br/><br/>But when you say "play this game at least once," it makes a lot more sense.  You're putting out a game, not a meme (and that's good, because compared to memes like "let's all redesign Supergirl's costume," I have to say that "let's all talk about this free game" doesn't have nearly the same curb appeal).<br/><br/>I guess what I'm getting at is that making your pitch focus on playing the game is inherently more interesting and less confusing to me.  I know why you'd want me to play your game, I'm less certain what you'd get out of having me just talk about it when there's no money being exchanged.  Except that obviously it's much less commitment on my part if I only have to talk about it as opposed to getting together some friends and devoting our limited free time to playing it...but if that's the only reason you're asking for conversation instead of actual play, then it's a bit like asking me for a picture of a car when what you really want is a ride to the airport.  You might as well just ask for what you want -- if you don't get it, that sucks, but at least you put it out there.  Asking for something meaningless instead certainly won't make things any better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179225/#Comment_179225" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T16:05:20+00:00" title="November 18, 2008  4:05PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 18, 2008 4:06PM by komradebob.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>I guess what I'm getting at is that making your pitch focus on playing the game is inherently more interesting and less confusing to me.

It changes the salesman from an enemy to a resource.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179232/#Comment_179232" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T16:30:00+00:00" title="November 18, 2008  4:30PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if the designer doesn't have much of a plan for the future?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179236/#Comment_179236" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T16:51:41+00:00" title="November 18, 2008  4:51PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Then what benefit would there be to asking someone to do something in the future for your game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179237/#Comment_179237" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T16:53:05+00:00" title="November 18, 2008  4:53PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I'm a little confused.</p>\n<p>What's the goal here?

Here, in this thread, the goal is shoot around ideas on ways to get people more engaged in, or commited to, a game, assuming the game to be free.<br/><br/>There are several ways I'd be interested in using such ideas.  Others might be interested in using those ideas differently.  So, sure, share ideas to raise popularity of free games, if that's what you have ideas about!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179271/#Comment_179271" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-19T00:38:33+00:00" title="November 19, 2008 12:38AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Going back to your original idea, I don't think that a voluntary naming and shaming technique - which is what this is - will work unless the community that it serves has a zero- or low-tolerance to people who back down on their public commitment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I say, on my blog, 'YES! I will be getting Game X and we will be playing it tomorrow and I will post something up about it by the end of the week!' and I do not, what sanction do you have? Can you 'punish' me in some way? Can you shame me in front of a community of people? Will that community really brand me as 'The Person Who Took The Free Game And Never Played It!'? What will happen when I bust out the 'IRL Issues...','My kid was ill...','Bob couldn't make it to the session...' etc. excuses?<br/>\n<br/>\nA promise, public or private, is only worth something if there is a sanction attached to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, thats the negative side of things, now to balance my posting karma with the positive side!<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom a theoretical point of view, what you want to do is balance the cost - actual and opportunity - of the transaction with that of the paid-committed-game? (I'm assuming that, all things being equal, free games have the same play utility as paid games.) Free games have no monetary cost and the same social opportunity cost ('Social Footprint' as it is being called here). Because of this low(er) cost, people seem to have less involvement in their decisions with regard to free games. I doubt many people consult their peers or do research into whether they should download a free pdf? (And because this is the internet, can I say 'Hello' to all of the people who are now going to post and tell me they do)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo how can we increase the involvement in the decision to participate in the game, whilst not incurring a cost?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about increasing their ownership of the game? Looking at free browser games, players have a whole load of freedom to write in this and that into their characters and the background etc. Look at shared universe fanfiction - this works in exactly the same way and creates powerful communities of commitment.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if, instead of presenting a game that was finished and whole, you offered the players a chance to participate in what was, essentially, a living game in development? Their content feeds back into the game. Their experiences create, for want of a better word, 'patches' to the rules that can be sent to all players. This is NOT playtesting. This is playEVOLVING. I creates a positive cost of commitment and ownership.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179283/#Comment_179283" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-19T06:49:10+00:00" title="November 19, 2008  6:49AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neil Gow</cite>What if, instead of presenting a game that was finished and whole, you offered the players a chance to participate in what was, essentially, a living game in development?
