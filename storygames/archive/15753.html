What we are seeing is a return to the fundamental roots of the game. An emphasis on exploration, roleplaying, and danger. Many of the specific rules of the game are being stripped away in order to empower the DM, and players. <br/><br/>However, they are talking about modularity and supporting the style of play offered in each edition, so presumably there will be a way to turn the nobs to have the level of abstraction we see in 4e. I'm just thinking that will not be in the base game.<br/><br/>So, basically the missing piece is bringing back the ability to create the evocative environments you need in order to make an exploration game interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357343/#Comment_357343" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-02T11:36:20+00:00" title="February  2, 2012 11:36AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2012 11:36AM by Ludanto.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hard to say what you're looking for.

Dungeon delves are played on a grid. And the power system created a set of player actions that were nearly always better than engaging the core system. Thus, there was a strong walled garden effect, and routines were established early.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ludanto</cite>Hard to say what you're looking for.

It's a wonderfully rich sandbox with potential delight wedged away in every corner.  Alas, it never breaks through into a immersion because there is very little interplay between the situations the player confronts in the game, and the player also has very little control over how their character resolves any of those situations.  <br/><br/>Happily, all of Skyrim's deficiencies are things that tabletop can do really really well!

Story Games usually isn't this way.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jjafuller</cite>Well, it has not been directly explicit. What we are seeing is a return to the fundamental roots of the game. An emphasis on exploration, roleplaying, and danger. Many of the specific rules of the game are being stripped away in order to empower the DM, and players.<br/><br/>However, they are talking about modularity and supporting the style of play offered in each edition, so presumably there will be a way to turn the nobs to have the level of abstraction we see in 4e. I'm just thinking that will not be in the base game.<br/><br/>So, basically the missing piece is bringing back the ability to create the evocative environments you need in order to make an exploration game interesting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jjafuller</cite>It wasn't so much destructive, so much as it withered due to lack of use. 4E is a very highly structured game, combats are played on a grid. Dungeon delves are played on a grid. And the power system created a set of player actions that were nearly always better than engaging the core system. Thus, there was a strong walled garden effect, and routines were established early.</blockquote>\nI don't have answers to your original post's questions but I can at least confirm that what you are saying was echoed to different degrees at the recent D&amp;D XP convention by both fans and designers. So you are certainly not the only one who feels this way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noah_D" title="Noah_D"><img alt="Noah_D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noah_D">Noah_D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357454/#Comment_357454" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-02T20:20:30+00:00" title="February  2, 2012  8:20PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, talked to my friend and GM who's kept up on 5E a lot better than I have.<br/><br/>It seems that WotC is going to try to make 5E work for both the player that has a full-fledged, detailed &amp; stat-filled character sheet, and the player that has a piece of paper with only 'Fighter, Strong, Big Sword' on it. Or, something to that effect. I think.<br/><br/><i>How</i> they're going to do this, we don't know, but we are intrigued. <br/><br/>jjafuller, I think I know where you're coming from. My group played a lot of 3E, and has played some 4E in the guise of Gamma World. You've got these neat powers that are very specifically defined, and that work together in certain ways for neat combos and such. When they're sitting in front of you, and there's a clearly delineated combat grid map, I tend to think in terms of 'what can my PC do with these powers' and 'how many squares am I away from X' and 'what's the move/attack radius of y', as opposed to 'would failure or success be more interesting here' or 'what would make this story cooler'. <br/><br/>Caveat: This very well may be a personal failing, rather than a failure of the 3E/4E systems. While we don't see that behavior much in our Star Trek FATE game, I think that may be equally attributable to our GM asking the latter questions, rather than setting us up for the former.<br/><br/>(In a way, I think your initial bit about 'immersion vs. abstraction' should be reversed; 3E/4E was immersive, feats for everything. 5E seems like it might be the other way around.)<br/><br/>But yeah, in a long-winded way, I think you're right about 3E/4E. But what to do about it? Good question. I'd suggest giving <a href="http://www222.pair.com/sjohn/risus.htm" rel="nofollow">Risus</a> a try. Free, with simple task resolution, it depends almost entirely on the creativity of the GM &amp; PCs.

I think I see what you are asking but need to clarify things.<br/><br/>Also what do you mean by this "do not focus much on environments"<br/><br/>I think I might be able to offer some suggestions (hopefully helpful).<br/></blockquote>\nIn my experience 4e works the best when invested in the combat system. The rules of the game really only sing in combat. That supporting rules exist, but generally situations out of combat only exist to provide a sense on continuity between battles. This natually happens because the tactical combats in the game take so long, the RP, exploration parts of the game end up getting smaller and smaller so you can make sure to keep getting your three fights per session to mantain the leveling pace. Another pressure comes from skill challenges that while a nice idea do not generally work out the way I think they were intended to. In effect I see them as taking fun exploration/rp activities and crushing them up into a series of die roles that abstract away a lot of the detail of what is happening underneath.<br/><br/>The least succesful 4e games I have run have offered many rp opportunities, with a description of the environments and other things that I would focus on in other dungeon crawl games. This resulted in players becoming disengaged from the system, and either chomping at the bit to "skip the boxed text" or pulling out the cellphones. And really, this wasn't even boxed text. Before a combat players generally just wanted a mechanical explaination of things in the room. Appearance didn't matter, and puzzles were skipped because they can be hand waved by skill rolls. So, room descriptions would end up something like, "brightly lit, these squares hinder, you need to make a save if you move over here. Roll for initiative."<br/><br/>The weird thing is, is that we play games like Fiasco and Dread, everyone has a good time and it is completely different. So I wouldn't say it was specficially the agenda of the players to seek out the crunch in games.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Noah D</cite><br/>jjafuller, I think I know where you're coming from.

Yes, they are part of the core system, but they are build on top of a system below. At any time you can engage the underlying system but you usually don't, because you have these powers that offer specific outcomes for specific actions that are almost always better than what you could get from DM arbitration. It's a great protection against bad DM's, but it kills creativity. I don't think what you are describing is a personal failing, I just think that is the play that is encouraged by the system.<br/><br/>Risus is an interesting suggestion. I'll think I'll have to pitch that to the group. I think I'll have to pitch that and see what we can do with it.<br/><br/>The prof recommendation is a neat idea.

I'll have to think on that one. I should mention that we also play Dread, and my group has been requesting I run it again so that might be a good one too.

I have also attempted to create new players, recruiting from other similar hobbies, and the game these players all want to learn is D&amp;D, because they have heard of it and know they can go where ever and find players (in theory).<br/><br/>So, yeah, no matter what D&amp;D looks like I will always end up playing and/or running it to some extent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357496/#Comment_357496" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-03T06:10:34+00:00" title="February  3, 2012  6:10AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            jjafuller<br/><br/>Just a quick note before I run off to work here.

However, if they decide to instead try to ignite a tree they have no idea what the result will be, so they will generally just use power X with the known outcome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller" title="jjafuller"><img alt="jjafuller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller">jjafuller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357526/#Comment_357526" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-03T08:36:03+00:00" title="February  3, 2012  8:36AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: akooser</cite>jjafuller<br/><br/>Just a quick note before I run off to work here.

I've been slowing hacking it a bit to help it click better with the groups I play with (uses a d20 instead of 2d6, using Ryan Macklin's XP system, more structured combat). The interesting thing is in that there is less pressure on me to develop scenes are the characters are driving the action, and my descriptions are general an elaboration of prompts created by the players. Hmmm... I wonder if I could reframe a D&amp;D game to work like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357540/#Comment_357540" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-03T09:41:52+00:00" title="February  3, 2012  9:41AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jjafuller</cite>It doesn't really say much of anything about it, which is the issue.

Using the following playgroup and playstyle modifications:<br/><br/>Playgroup - makes sure everyone is on the same page about creativity, especially but not limited to the DM. After all it only takes one person blocking to sap the creativity from the group.<br/><br/>Playstyle - make characters as normal (but it need not be too strictly), and then largely ignore the power mechanics - just keep the powers themselves. So a first level infernal warlock could:<br/><br/>At-will: create crackling bolts of eldritch energy and scour someone with your anger and pain made manifest in fire. (Eldritch Blast and Hellish Rebuke)<br/><br/>Once per encounter: create a great claw of sulphrous darkness that moves as your hand. (Diabolic Grasp)<br/><br/>Once per day: sheath yourself in a black ice. (Armor of Agathys)<br/><br/>As you play you use these powers to affect the situations during and between encounters - to resolve things (yes, even combats) roll an appropriate skill. The DC is determined by the situation by the DM (as normal), so things like channelling your fiery anger at someone ought to make it easier to Intimidate them and so on. If you fail things no doubt get more complicated, you get wounded, winded, or otherwise hindered - in either case the situation can then change either through using powers, different skills, or DM actions. <br/><br/>The goal here is to use the restriction of powers as a creative stimulus, not as an out to avoid being creative. <br/><br/>Sure some of this may seem a drastic departure from the standard playstyle, but if you look carefully enough it really isn't a departure from the rules.<br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357794/#Comment_357794" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-04T16:14:39+00:00" title="February  4, 2012  4:14PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For 'games that help you practice exploration', I'd recommend <a href="http://ludisto.blogspot.com/2005/10/conquer-horizon-pdf.html" rel="nofollow">Conquer the Horizon</a>, a tiny game that is awesome and is all about a group of colonists (essentially) exploring a brand-new-to-them landscape. The mechanics of the game are competitive -- you are trying to find resources that you can exploit to some particular ends -- but you get a competitive advantage if you are able to easily elaborate and build on existing locations, people, resources, etc.<br/><br/>Microscope is also a possibility, but I'd suggest approaching it with an extremely explicit goal of focusing on the worldbuilding/descriptive elements, as it naturally trends towards focusing on situations/narrative instead. But there is really no reason you could not use Microscope to build a sandbox, by focusing on creating a wide variety of interconnected situations, and the mechanics will definitely put your creativity on the spot.<br/><br/>Of course these are both high-scope games, relative to something like 'how do I get better at making a single dungeon seem really interesting?' I can't really tell whether you are more concerned about your ability to create a compelling world-at-large, or to make the immediate environment more compelling for your players.

Play some narrative focused creative one-nighters like Fiasco, then have a frank discussion with the group about changing your 4e playstyle to something similar to what Mendel suggests. I too, play 4e in this way, and have largely turned powers into Dungeon World moves. Focus on the story implicit in the mechanics of the powers and you will have a blast.
