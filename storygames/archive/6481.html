That, and Mr. Stolze can run a game like nobody's business. <br/>\n<br/>\nI purchased UA after playing that game, and still have not run a game of it myself to date. It's not a bad system, but mostly it's a "Get Out of the Way" system, with the Madness Meters mostly being there to create a little atmosphere. Or so was my impression the couple of times I've played. Sorcerer, on the other hand, I've run, and works well to propell play. And if the characters in Jailbrake can't be seen to have demons... well then somebody isn't looking too hard. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJailbrake is a good enough scenario that you could run it freeform, and it'll turn out well. But if you're going to choose to use a system for it, I'd go with Sorcerer. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143482/#Comment_143482" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-12T08:49:05+00:00" title="May 12, 2008  8:49AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Run Jailbrake using Sorcerer.</blockquote>\nYou know, the thought did cross my mind.<br/><br/>How the heck would that work, though?

Better not to hack the system if you aren't familiar with it.  Most of those 300 pages are the various spells and background hints.  The reading for the system, and whatever abilities the pre-gen PCs have for the scenario is going to be much less (and like Thunder God says, it's a slim system, so its a fast read).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143576/#Comment_143576" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-12T13:53:19+00:00" title="May 12, 2008  1:53PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 12, 2008 1:57PM by Mike_Holmes.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            He'd just be taking the situation, and implementing it.

Which is that UA is mostly a get out of the way system (albeit one that risks a huge whiff factor depending on how one interprets the die rolling mechanic), and certainly there are many systems that could run Jailbreak smoothly. <br/><br/>And then I was going to add that I hate hate hate madness meters. It seems like every time I got to a cool situation in either UA or Nemesis (which also has the Madness Meters), the mechanics step in and tell me how my character behaves. It feels like an anti-bang moment when ever it steps in. Wow, I hate that. It's like the system doesn't trust me enough to recognize when is a good time to act, and what actions would be appropriate. <br/><br/>However, I have a lot of friends who love UA. Long form games that run months or years, one-shots, these people play UA all the time.<br/><br/>So what I'm wondering is, who is this game for? Who is going to be playing? Someone like me who'll get pissed off that the mechanics are stepping in to dictate actions whenever something juicy comes up? Or someone like them (and I say <i>them </i>with love in my voice, after all, this is my friends I'm talking about), people who love that the mechanics push them to act in certain situations?<br/><br/>*******<br/><br/>As for Jailbreak itself, I've read it and not played it, and while it sounds super cool, why does it recommend actor stance over author stance? Any opinions anyone? Because to me it seems like it would be way cooler if players used out of character information to set up really cool scenes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143601/#Comment_143601" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-12T15:49:54+00:00" title="May 12, 2008  3:49PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 12, 2008 3:50PM by Jogesh EZ.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>But in the end, he's intending to try out a system he's interested in.

The expectation at Gameday probably leans more to the GMs being experienced, but there have been plenty of events with people running stuff for the first time.

That is we the players are entertained by Stolze's story, and really are given only one big bang (there's a prelude bang, too, but the real one is the best I've ever seen). Play is suspenseful leading up to the bang, as we get hints of what it's about, and then, once the bang happens, the reveal having been accomplished, then things really get wild as players have free reign to create all sorts of endings. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole thing works because of the nature of the hidden information, and precisely because of how it's hidden. That's the ingenious part. I don't normally recommend this sort of play, but done this well, it's a ton of fun. I myself have used a very similar structure for my Con scenario called "The Ending Season." I only just now have realized that. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's definitely not something I'd ever do in long-term play of a game.

Well, cool ish, not really what I'm looking for, but whatever. I was wondering more about the, well, the actual example he gives is (spoiler alert) if the hostages are trying to escape in the basement, the criminals should not use that information to go into the basement. But, like, it seems to me that's exactly what one of the criminals should do. Like, I could see the one who was sympathetic going down there to warn them to be quieter or more careful. Or maybe even one of the other criminals to go down there and create one of those tense scenes of like, is the hostage taker going to notice that anything is amiss (ok, that won't work too well in a task resolution game I don't think, but whatever).<br/><br/>Now are you saying that the non-GM players should be avoiding scenes like <i>that </i>because they take away from the story that Stolze has written?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143706/#Comment_143706" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-13T09:20:41+00:00" title="May 13, 2008  9:20AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2008 9:32AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man... I dunno. On the one hand, I'm all about allowing players to run the plot off in their own direction. But on the other hand, this is a set-piece, and it makes sense to run it to the big bang. That's the point of the scenario, and it's not really much good without it. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I suggest is using more "illusionisty" or even "narrativisty" techniques to accomplish the same goals, yeah. But using strong GM control of situation to make sure that the cool bang occurs. No, don't quite railroad, but do the GM job in such a way as to not let the subject matter get on another track. <br/>\n<br/>\nI talk about this seeming paradox all the time. People think that play must either be "GM controls the Plot" or "GM sets up a situation and let's it go." Thinking that any control of the evolving situation amounts to control of plot. As I always say, what you want to do is use as heavy a hand as neccessary to give your players something interesting about which to make decisions. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo... let's say that the hostages somehow manage to get out of the house and run. OK, that's cool, they got to demonstrate that their characters weren't going to sit still for this treatment. It's a simple matter for them to run into a previously unseen fence (maybe a special one created by the house's owner), that prevents them from getting far. Heck, allow them to arm themselves and maybe even take out the prisoners. It's not neccessary for any one group to be in control. Just have that interaction go on, and be revealing more and more. If the action moves out into the yard, then that's where the daughter is playing. And the bang can be heard banging from inside a shed they find. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlter the world to meet the evolving situation, such that you get the same effects. It's not railroading or illusionism (though illusion may be involved), because you haven't forced the characters to make any decisions. The player can still feel creative to an extent up to this point. And you get to do the reveal, and then that's when players get to go gonzo with their responses, and the remainder of how the scenario plays out is up to them. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo this extent, Stolze's advice is good, if taken from another perspective. As GM, simply keep the events occuring fast enough that the players are constantly being creative in their responses to the events in-character. Don't let them start thinking strategically or such. Keep the characters on their heels, so that the players aren't taking play away from the fun stuff, but reacting to it. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, a player decides to have his prisoner character go down to deal with the hostages when they're deciding to break out, creating that cool sort of scene you mention. Heck, let's even propose that the sympathetic prisoner decides to help the hostages escape. Simply hit them with the next bit of information after making this decision. Allow the decision to be made to escape, but do not allow action to be taken relevant to the decision before you present a change in the situation that moves the focus of play back onto the stuff that's going to lead to the end of the scenario. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the players are playing using narrativism as you suppose, instead of being all like, "I run from this freaky stuff!" more like, "Wow, that's some crazy stuff... I have to check it out..." You know, using the logic of folks in horror movies... :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if/when the do flee, then you can use my fence idea above, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that it's been quite a while since I've read the scenario text. I could be forgetting a lot about it. In fact I'm certain that I am. I recall, for instance, that one of the van occupants (hostages) is a reporter, but not who the other(s) are. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143830/#Comment_143830" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-13T20:52:13+00:00" title="May 13, 2008  8:52PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reviewing the <i>Sorcerer</i> text, PCs are supposedly very powerful people ("toughest, baddest, proudest men and women alive," p.84).

It was quite some time ago, but I did it as a one-shot introduction to UA for a group at the local game store before starting a slightly longer (but still short-term, 5 session, game) they made their own characters for.  It went really well.  Everyone had fun, and though only one or two people had any experience with UA, no one had any trouble picking it up.  The core book might be long, but the rules are quite straight forward.<br/><br/>It's interesting to read this thread, though, because when I ran that it was back when UA was the most "indie" and "rules light" thing I'd ever read or played with.  I'm pretty new to the story games scene/concept and I might have to dig the book back out and read the scenario again with some of these new ideas in mind.<br/><br/>I've never played Sorcerer (though I've read it), but I have trouble imagining the characters in Jailbreak as Sorcerers.  But then, I suppose the exact nature of "demons" is flexible.  So for some of the characters they could be literal demons for others they could just be like, I dunno, inner rage or something that fuels them, right?<br/><br/>If you do us UA, one thing to keep in mind is that Jailbreak was written for first edition.  It doesn't make much difference, but I think there's one or two skills (initiative is one, i think...) that's in second and not in first that needs to be added to the characters.  it wasn't anything problematic to deal with.<br/><br/>Someone mentioned the "whiff factor."  That refers to low skills and frequent fails, right?  That could be a pain... but then, at least when it comes to combat, UA can get pretty bloody pretty fast.  So it was never a big problem for me...  When I ran Jailbreak, I'm pretty sure almost everyone died.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143907/#Comment_143907" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T07:19:43+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  7:19AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2008 7:25AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way I've always interpeted this, and I think Ron's words elswhere back this up (though I could be completely wrong), is that by "toughest" etc, he means "are so extraodinary that they've bent reality somehow." <br/>\n<br/>\nBy that definition, I think that the PCs of the scenario fit. Don't the hostages have powers, too? Or no? Given their exposure to the scenario, I think you might get away with making them latent sorcerers. Become sorcerers by their experience, and their desperate need. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll I know is that I've made much more "mundane" sorcerers than this for Sorcerer. We had one game run by Josh Neff, very memorable, where my character was just about keeping up with the Joneses in suburbia, and the "Twin Peaks"-ishness that underlied that society. His demon was his dead wife that he'd ressurected after a car crash. Later in play he summoned up "the Man in the Mirror." <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that the characters in the UA scenario are pretty much exactly on this level, and that it would work just as well as it did for our game. The old couple are, in fact, really sorcerous. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian (crossposted), playing Sorcerer involves coming up in every game with a local definition for demons. Some people have played with demons being mental illnesses, for instance. In one game demons meant an inner demon that made the charcter a were-wolf. Vampires works great, too (in fact to some extent I think that Ron made Sorcerer as a fix to V:TM). <br/>\n<br/>\nSo "Demons as UA Powers?" Hell yeah. It fits perfectly, and, I believe, actually makes them better, once you work out the details. <br/>\n<br/>\nHell, I'm absolutely sure that somewhere somebody has already done this conversion. It's too obvious not to have been done already.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere's an interesting thread on the comparison: http://forum.rpg.net/archive/index.php/t-214015.html<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143912/#Comment_143912" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T07:36:14+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  7:36AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2008 7:40AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            LOL.

Yeah, characters had skills in the 30s and stats around 60, and if I recall, the way UA works is, under optimal (or normal? I can't remember) circumstances you don't roll for tasks, under extreme circumstances you roll percentages against your skills (that would mean success about a third of the time), and other some kind of in-between circumstances you roll at stat (I think), which means you succeed about two thirds of the time. But the GM kept making every roll as extreme circumstances so we kept rolling against skill values and so we failed more than we succeeded. Note, this isn't really all that difficult to avoid I don't think, just make most rolls happen at the higher level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144015/#Comment_144015" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T13:28:21+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  1:28PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah.  It's been awhile since I looked at the book but in 2nd ed. there were three levels of skills checks, Minor, Significant, and Major.  I think you're dead on about the harder two of them (though IIRC, it's much better for you to roll under the skill with a Significant check.  Under Stat but over Skill succeeds, but not that well).  I can't actually remember whether you're supposed to roll for Minor stuff or not... I thought you did but it was even easier yet...<br/>Theoretically, any time you're in doing something really tense it probably IS a Major check.  I think there were some pretty good guidelines in the book to figure out where you were.  You're supposed to consider whether time is a factor or whether it will matter if you fail and whether you can try again.  any combat rolls should be done that way, i think.  missing a lot is probably better than the first person to fire a gun immediately hitting and killing the other person.<br/><br/>but... this is probably getting off topic.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  i should shut up since i've made my view pretty clear.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144089/#Comment_144089" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T20:06:12+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  8:06PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Other threads that might interest you:<br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=2640.0" rel="nofollow">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=2640.0</a></blockquote>\nHey, Ron is talking about non-sorcerer PCs with Lore 0 or 1.

It seems like it could do some UA stuff pretty well given that UA is also very concerned with Madness.  On the other hand, Exhaustion isn't necessarily always such and issue... and I'm not sure how well it would map to that particular scenario, given that I'm pretty sure not all the characters would have both Madness and Exhaustion talents.  It seems like some might have one, and others might have the other...  So...  I dunno.  Probably not.  But it was the only thing that came to mind as even a slight possibility.<br/><br/>There's always PTA.  Another one I need to play but haven't yet.  Everyone always says it can be used for just about anything, though.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  All the characters certainly have big freaking Issues.  Of course, given that it's a one shot, I'm not sure what you'd do with screen presence.  Some characters are arguably more important than others, though.<br/><br/>Or, potentially... Mortal Coil?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
