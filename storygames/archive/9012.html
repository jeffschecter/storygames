It looked like this:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/foucalt/3390807782/" rel="nofollow" title="Game Design Playtest by Foucalt, on Flickr"><img alt="Game Design Playtest" height="334" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3429/3390807782_2505897bc2.jpg" width="500"/></a><br/><br/>Right now it plays in two phases: the Carcassone/DungeonMaking phase and then the Risk/DungeonWar phase. It's fun, but there's lots of room for improvement. <br/><br/>In DungeonMaking, players take turns drawing random tiles and placing them on the board, having opportunity to claim territory for their monsters as they do so. Each player starts with 4 monsters: a Drow, an Undead, a Beast, and a Humanoid. Like meeples in Carcassone, your claim can only be placed on the tile you just put down, your claim holds for all contiguous tiles until it's ended by doors or other impediments, and you get your guy back when an area gets "finished" (for now, those scraps of paper on top mark finished areas). Certain tiles grant bonuses or penalties to the monsters in whose territory they are, such as "+1 [dice] to Beasts" or "Attacking monsters may not pass through the portcullis".  Stairs up, because they are near the "entrance" to the dungeon, make monsters weaker, likewise, stairs down to the next level grant bonuses because those monsters are tougher by the universal laws of dungeons. DungeonMaking ends when all tiles are exhausted.<br/><br/>In DungeonWar, you pit your monsters against the monsters of your opponents to gain territory and conquer the dungeon (at this point there are no adventurers, only monsters - that may change). In general, the number of tiles your monster posesses (plus or minus any tile benefits) is the number of d6s it rolls in combat, whether attacking or defending. Every monster type gains a bonus die against another particular monster type. You can only attack monsters whose territory touches your own. Combat goes like this right now  (working on this, highly subject to change):<br/>1) The attacker declares whether he is going to attempt to <b>enslave</b> or <b>kill</b> the defender. The defender is always killing.<br/>2) All dice are rolled. A side attempting to enslave counts up 1s, a side attempting to kill counts 5s and 6s. Killing dice come immediately out of the other side's dice pool, simultaneously. Enslaving dice are tracked but do not inflict damage. If all a side's dice are exhausted, it is killed. If total number of enslaving dice rolled is greater than the other side's dice pool at the beginning of combat, it is enslaved.<br/>3) If neither side is killed or enslaved, go back to (1). Enslaving dice accumulate from round to round, unless the attacker switches to killing.  <br/><br/>After combat, the attacker heals 2 dice of damage (or more if you have certain tiles in that monster's territory). Enslaved monsters switch sides to the attacker. Adjacent monster territories of the same monster type controlled by the same player are automatically combined. Players take turns initiating combats. The first player to go in DungeonWar is the one whose turn it would have been in DungeonMaking if there had been more tiles. Eventually, somebody  has full control of the dungeon with some combination of their monsters holding all territory. That player wins.<br/><br/>I'm going to use this thread to journal as I design, but it's open for questions and such too, should anyone want to discuss it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dyson%20Logos" title="Dyson Logos"><img alt="Dyson Logos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dyson%20Logos">Dyson Logos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199158/#Comment_199158" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-27T14:53:45+00:00" title="March 27, 2009  2:53PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The dungeonmaking part makes me uber happy.

Originally I had a concept that tied it strongly to D&amp;D (or any other favorite dungeoncrawl game) - the gaming group would sit down together, take turns placing tiles/making map/claiming territory as above, and then one of several different stage2's would occur:<br/><br/>1) The adventuring party enters the dungeon (with the map visible to everyone, but some way of randomizing which monsters have treasure or something) and as the party goes room to room, whoever's monster they encounter runs the monster for that battle and someone takes that dude's character for that battle. So, open-map shared-gm carcassone DungeonCrawl. <br/><br/>2) You continue to take turns and you can either move the party on your turn (and whoever owns the monster runs the encounter), rest the party, or move a monster. If a monster move generates a monster-on monster fight, the group plays it out, with the people owning those two monsters responsible for handing out preprepped stats and such. Presumably D&amp;D minis cards (and possibly combat rules) would work really well here to save effort.<br/><br/>Does either of those sound more appealing than DungeonWars?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199188/#Comment_199188" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-27T20:02:15+00:00" title="March 27, 2009  8:02PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sold on the idea of needing adventures myself.

You get points for taking down specific Adventurers, and the game ends when either they're killed or you're all killed. A winner can still be named by points you've collected, but there are a lot of points to be had for killing Adventurers. The Adventurers also have gold and gems. You can instead bargain for those items, and the monster with the most of that at the end gets a special points bonus for that.<br/><br/>Don't forget the art of trap setting, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199210/#Comment_199210" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-28T12:55:50+00:00" title="March 28, 2009 12:55PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice!<br/><br/>The first thing that came to my mind when I saw this was:<br/><br/>You need a "Wandering Adeventurers" Table. You roll on it under certain circumstances you want to discourage... and if you're not lucky, a bunch of adventurers might attack your monster/s or steal tiles and/or treasure from you, distracting you from whatever business you're involved in.<br/><br/>I kind of like the idea of generating a random "PC Party" each time (a "strength" in dice and one descriptor or ability would be sufficient, I think), and placing them on a randomly selected tile. They "take over" that tile, and move to adjacent tiles on subsequent turns, taking them over as well.<br/><br/>This would help balance the game a bit--the more territory you own, the more likely the adventurers will be on your turf, distracting you from your war of expansion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199506/#Comment_199506" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-30T12:37:24+00:00" title="March 30, 2009 12:37PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm thinking about some sort of "factions". Such as "Undead", "Goblinoids", "Drow", "Dark Cult" and stuff like that. So instead of everyone having one of each, you have this sort of specific "monsters pool", each faction with some special effects (for example, the goblins would be weaker, but you'd have more of them, or maybe they "reproduce" and heal faster). And you can have an "Adventurers" faction, that while unable to affect the tiles the same way the others can, are more "efficient" and have a wider range of "skills".<br/><br/>And then the whole "pokemon rock-paper-scisors" thing would make a lot of sense. And you have the enslaving thing to try ballancing your team by covering your weak spots.<br/><br/>Man, I'm loving it. I have always wanted to (but been unable to) play that old Dungeon Keeper PC game.
