                    So I was chatting with Wicked Dead game design diva Annie Rush this morning:<br/><br/>12:08 PM  <b>AR:</b> It's a good thing to have friends who are willing to whack us melancholy introspectives with the wake-up hammers when need be. <br/> <b>me:</b> indeed. <br/>12:09 PM  that's what friends are for. <br/>12:11 PM  <b>AR:</b> "trite" sayings became "trite" through overuse. but they were overused because they are very often true. <br/>12:16 PM  <b>me:</b> i like "that's what friends are for" because it can apply to anything, including, say, killing hordes of zombies with a weedwhacker. <br/>   or, in this case, hitting you with a metaphorical hammer. <br/>12:17 PM  <b>AR:</b> *doodles comic of that* <br/>12:18 PM  <b>me:</b> there should be a game about relationships in which the characters engage in metaphorical combat with each other. <br/>   like, when you break up with someone, you stab them in the heart with a knife, metaphorically. <br/>12:20 PM  <b>AR:</b> what kind of game? <br/>12:22 PM  <b>me:</b> i was thinking roleplaying. <br/>12:23 PM  most roleplayers pay the most attention to the combat system anyway. so if it was completely metaphorical, you might actually be able to do something interesting with combat. instead of the normal yawn <br/> <b>AR:</b> now there's a thought that's gonna fester. <br/>12:24 PM  And when you see someone walking around in-game with an arsenal of weapons strapped to them, it means something totally different. <br/>12:25 PM  <b>me:</b> indeed. it means you probably don't want to be their friend. <br/>   but everybody has some weapons; sometimes they're carefully concealed though. <br/> <b>AR:</b> "Walk softly and carry a big stick" <br/> <b>me:</b> and you could actually carry around your emotional baggage and stuff. <br/>12:26 PM  <b>AR:</b> That would surely be helpful <br/> <b>me:</b> and write down problems from past relationships on your character sheet. <br/> <b>AR:</b> "experience" <br/> <b>me:</b> "16d6 blade of vorpal heartbreak" <br/> <b>AR:</b> nods <br/> <b>me:</b> whoa, being "experienced" could mean all sorts of good and bad things. <br/>12:27 PM  <b>AR:</b> Yeah. and if you have an "experience" down and don't learn from it, it hurts your character <br/>12:29 PM  <b>me:</b> i've been wanting to write a game called "the wars of the roses" for a while. this could be it. <br/>12:31 PM  <b>AR:</b> cos you know if you don't, I might<br/><br/>Discuss.<br/><br/>Yes, I know about Bliss Stage already.  Thanks.                </div>

                            Two spin-off thoughts.  <br/>
<br/>
(1) The artist James C. Christensen often depicts characters as physically caring the weight of whats of their mind (see the "Responsible Woman", "Responsible Man").  In fact, an entire segment of his art is dedicated to physical/visible manifestations of intangible properties.  Neat Stuff, IMO.<br/>
<br/>
(2) For a couple of months now, I've had a "little idea" about a game where in one trades "Fire" or "Passion" for "Peace" or "Success".  Inspired somewhat by the personal interactions in the show Smallville, "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" and real life.  The basic idea is that a character has an internal metaphysical fire that drives them toward a goal.  However, along the way to that goal they must live life and encounter conflicts as a result.  "Fire" points can be spent to achieve small goals, but are obviously depleted along the way. For example, a character who is passionate about becoming a world-famous artist might trade some of their passion to 'get a real job' in order to eat.  Do that often enough, and the process of living replaces the passion....<br/>
<br/>
Hrm... writing this up feels a little dark. But then some people like that.                        </div>

<br/>
Blue, John: YES.  The point about fights in Buffy always meaning something is definitely going to stuck in my head (since "meaning something" is different than just "the stakes"), as is the idea of metaphorically trading one thing for another ("Will you trade dreams for happiness?").                        </div>

Dude, this is COMPLETELY different than Passions.  Your character does not carry around physical objects that represent their Passions.  You do not describe your character beating people with your Passions.  You cannot take your hated of your father and craft it into a weapon with which to whip serious ass.  This isn't some social combat system where you're fueled by your powerful emotional oomph.  This is an actual, physical combat system (your ex-girlfriend actually does crazy wuxia moves to slice your heart in two) whose effects are felt on an emotional level.  Imagine having a gunfight in Dogs and taking the fallout all in emotional terms.  You can actually shoot people with sapphire bullets of pure love!                        </div>

                            So, basically what you're talking about is mechanically identical to Passions/Muses/Relationships(trollbabe)/Relationships(dogs) but what you're saying is that the fictional elements are somewhat different -- they are represented by physical objects being the primary thing.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, it's interesting.  I'm a big monkey for system, though, so I was hoping for a mechanical innovation.  Ah, well.  We can't always get what we want.<br/>

                            The demand for productivity has killed me a little inside.<br/>
<br/>
I dunno about it though.  This idea of literal metaphors in gaming is cleary a very powerful one - people play nobilis and get really excited when they realize they can rip the Hate out of your heart and forge it into a weapon that can cut the bonds of family (or maybe kill kittens. Damn kittens).    I'm fairly sure that nobilis is the apex of this idea, but it shows up in a lot of games that have a higher weirdness/magic context. Eventually it starts getting kind of flat though, as the removal of limitations makes all things equally cool.  Not that that means "Screw that idea!" but rather that I'd be wary of seperating cool from novel.<br/>
<br/>
So that said, the part that resonates really seems to be the funny part.   The image of the guy loaded down with too much crap.  As the basis for a humorous game (Neurosis Wars!) this would probably be pretty rockin'.<br/>
<br/>
Alternately, mandating symbolism or concentrating on the problems of it generates can also be awesome.  I just don't want to flinch in the face of the next guy I run across who weilds a blade forged of his burning passion for snacks, the blade folded once for each time he sat down to watch TV.<br/>

<p>Huh. I had some of this going on when working on the Surreal Wuxia Western (with Shreyas &amp; Daniel). I suggested that social conflicts have physical effects like in combat. I imagined the big bad preacher man walking into a bar and pointing at the mercenaries in the rafters: "THOU SHALT NOT KILL!!" and <em>boom</em> the entire balcony explodes into splinters and the bad guys go flying. The sheer force of moral weight kicks their asses.</p>

                            So Buck's baggage was all embodied in the Pussy Wagon?  That, er, that's sorta makes a dark kind of sense.  That's explains why the car is so big, loud, obvious, tasteless, and stupid.<br/><br/>But yeah, Tarantino is big on visual symbolism, especially in that movie, which may be partially due to the Eastern cinemagraphic traditions that he was drawing on.  I mean Zhang Yimou does that all the time.  The red dye imagery in <i>Ju Dou</i>.  Basically all of <i>Hero</i>.<br/><br/>I think it's a little early to expect mechanical innovation out of a half-baked idea.  It's still gonna take a fair bit of work to turn this Little Idea into a Big Idea.<br/><br/>Rob's spot-on about the literal metaphors business.  It's A) really cool, but <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> has the potential to lose it's impressiveness after a while.                        </div>

                            Well, I was thinking that all of the intermediary fights were really just projections of the Bride and Bill's relationship problems, but yours works, too.                        </div>

                            A great movie for symbolic combat is Jet Li's <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0108281/" rel="nofollow"><b>Tai Chi Master</b></a>.  The really cool thing is that the fighting styles express the dramatic thrust of the movie.  The flowing, balanced moves of Tai Chi are contrasted with the harsh moves of the other styles -- which matches the growth in his life from the monastery to living with a family.  <br/><br/>I've tried this in some of my games.  So, for example, the second-to-last episode of Season Two of our Buffy campaign was called <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/~jhkim/rpg/buffy/siliconvalley/season2.html#s2_e14" rel="nofollow"><b>The Glass Ceiling</b></a>.  There, the characters entered into a pyramid in faerie and fought with a host of the <a href="http://www.shanmonster.com/witch/wildhunt/sluagh.html" rel="nofollow">Sluagh</a>.  <br/><br/>Here, the evil faeries were symbolic of the glorification of conflict.  The PCs charged in to rescue their friend Laney who had been kidnapped.  However, the sluagh didn't care in the slightest about Laney.  They purely wanted to fight.  So a battle raged below, while in an office in the top of the pyramid, the mastermind of the plot Samuel Devins walked about watched while eating popcorn.  I feel like this one worked really well.  The Sluagh were amusing in a violent way, but they were really nasty and were causing real wounds to all the PCs.  The interesting thing was in how the different PCs reacted to this.                        </div>
