They have all been uploaded to the site, and are available <a href="http://rpgchallenge.wordpress.com/2007/03/01/review-assignments/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>I'm really excited to check them out. I feel like people should feel free to take a look and give feedback, here at Story Game or on the blog, even if you're not a participant in the challenge. That would be neat.<br/><br/>Anyway, just an update, and thanks to everyone who entered!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
