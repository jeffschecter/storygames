One scenario could have the entire game a flashback in the form of a group VK Test. How the players respond to the challenges in the scenario (linked to the "pulls") equates to their passing/failing the test as they recount their actions.<br/><br/>The question of whether or not a player is a BladeRunner is secondary to whether or not they are Replicants (what if Deckard suspected he might be a Replicant earlier in the movie?). At it's heart, BladeRunner asks "what does it mean to be human?"<br/><br/>For the Purist, there's little need for BladeRunners off-world; their job was to keep skin-jobs off Earth. I like the simple A/B/C traits but if you're fixed on players <i>knowing </i>that they're Replicants, you should decide what kind of Replicants they can be: combat(Roy), pleasure(Pris), labour(Leon), assassin (Zhora), other.

I think you'd have to give players a choice of questions or you'll end up with some unsatisfactory answers.<br/>"A tortoise is on it's back, baking in the sun. You don't turn it over. <i>Why</i>?"<br/><br/>Many players, if forced to take this question, will say "I wouldn't do that." But that's not a satisfactory answer to "<i>Why </i>did you do that?" They may then feel forced to answer "Because I'm cruel."  Obvious answers are leading and unsatisfactory.<br/><br/>I might choose this question and answer "Because it looks sickly and gross. I don't want to touch it"  I've established an interesting fact about my character/Replicant. He's squeamish. Didn't see that coming.<br/><br/>"Your sister comes to you in a panic. She admits she's killed her husband and wants you to shelter her. You refuse. Why?" <br/>-She's my sister-in-law. She's killed my brother.<br/>-She's my twin sister and probably wants me to take the fall for her. The selfish bitch.<br/>-I'm a BladeRunner. I won't shelter anyone; even my sister.<br/>-I don't want to be an accessory (lame/obvious and unhelpful to establishing Character).<br/><br/>Edit: "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"

Other than getting <br/>less chips to start with, there doesn't seem to be any effect. Is it because a higher Att <br/>grants immunity from certain pulls (if you have an "A" in Physical, you don't have to pull; <br/>"B" or less, make two pulls)? I seem to remember that from the earlier draft. So, Chips will <br/>act as a "Luck" resource for less capable characters. They can be applied in any challenge <br/>but you only have a limited number.<br/><br/><br/>It's cool that you used the VK Test questions from the movie but will the answers actually <br/>be useful in play?<br/><br/> Although less interesting as questions, something like the following would be more useful <br/>to "push" the characters; short answers, listed bullet-style on a sheet, that you can refer <br/>to during play.<br/><br/>Basic Test<br/>What is your -<br/>name:<br/>occupation:<br/>greatest hope/dream:<br/>greatest fear/phobia:<br/>greatest hatred/enemy:<br/>greatest love/joy:<br/>fondest memory:<br/><br/>  Quick, simple and easy to reference during play.<br/><br/>  The actual VK Questions could still be used for "flavour" but also tie into another <br/>mechanic: Empathy. That's what the VK Test is actually testing to see if you are Human or <br/>Replicant. Replicants don't have the life-experience to react according to social norms. <br/><br/>Rachel fails the Test when here reactions indicate that she feels more empathy for the raw <br/>oysters than the boiled dog.<br/><br/> Imagine a third Attribute: Social. All characters start with a "C" rating. Anytime a player <br/> "takes the pull" for another player (puts themselves in harms way, when the situation is <br/>related to their answers in the Basic Test), they go up a Social level (or knock down the <br/>tower, showing that they are a Replicant). Attaining an "A" rating doesn't prove you are <br/>Human, but it shows that you must be at least a Nexus "<b>7</b>"; almost indistinguishable from human, possibly unlimited life span, certainly more moral than most humans (Roy saves his assassin's [Deckard's] life); More Human Than Human.<br/><br/>Quick example: failed Colony over-run by spider-like aliens. A character is attacked by one. Another character with Fear: spiders wants to jump in to kill it or otherwise save the first character (take the pull for them).  Because this character is testing his/her Empathy, the combat result is secondary to testing whether or not the character gains a Social level or revealing that they are a Replicant. <br/><br/> So, you <i>survive </i> the game and want to know if you're Human or Replicant. As game moderator, you have already looked over the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">actual </span> VK Test Answers (turtle, mother, etc.) and put a check or X beside each answer, according to whatever criteria you want (funny,original,well-worded, spelling and grammar, doesn't matter). Count up the X's. Each surviving player can then nullify one X for each Chip they have left. No X's left indicate that the character is human. <br/><br/>  For all it matters, you could just ask the player "How many answers do you think you got <br/>right?" and compare that to a random number. But the above method actually gives the players <br/>some say as they might save/spend chips towards the end of the game to skew the result <br/>towards the outcome that they want ("I wanna save these three Chips and prove I'm Human"; "I'd rather use them up and survive even if it means I'm a Replicant"; "I have Chips left over but I won't spend them because I <i>want </i> to be a Replicant/believe I am a Replicant (although if they got all checks on their answers, they are in fact Human).<br/><br/>Scenario Titles/Themes: (from the movie)<br/>- They don't advertise for killers in the newspaper.<br/>-"Skin jobs", cops and  "little people"<br/>-Have you ever retired a human by mistake?<br/>-Painful to live in fear, isn't it?<br/>-Wake up!

Good luck.<br/><br/>Edit: I just asked myself "what if you survive the game with a Social of less than "A". It says nothing about whether you're Human or Replicant. Just that you're selfish/unwilling to help another character. <br/><br/>At it's heart, BladeRunner asks "what does it mean to be human?"<br/>Answer: to be humane.<br/><br/>  Having a low Social Att means that your character is, in fact, Less Human Than Human; regardless of biology.

This book wasn\u2019t used in education anymore. I was doing exercises from it because I was ahead. (I was after in some other classes, but that\u2019s how school works\u2026 when it\u2019s reading time, it\u2019s reading time.) One of the questions was, out of the blue, a \u201cmoral\u201d or almost Voight-Kampff-ish style question. No other question in the entire book was like this, they were all \u201cWhat color dress did the mom have in the story?\u201d The question was not related to the text.<br/><br/>\u201cYou see a squirrel eating the eggs of a bluebird. What do you do?<br/>A) Chase it away.<br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> Look on gleefully.<br/>C) Smash the eggs.<br/>D) Walk away.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Now, back then I was very, very squeamish and scared of gory, bloody and scary things. More than anyone else I knew. I also loved squirrels generally (I had a squirrel doll), but I also loved bluebirds and thought this was a cruel side of the squirrel that I was not familiar with. I also knew about the circle of life. Some animals eat other animals.<br/><br/>I chose D) Walk away.<br/>I didn\u2019t think much of it until I graded myself (by checking the lettered answer cheat). I had made only one mistake in the chapter \u2014 this question.<br/>The correct answer was \u201cA) Chase it away.\u201d<br/><br/>I asked my teacher and she said it was OK, that there was no right and wrong, and that that was a weird question. She agreed with my call to walk away since I told her it was scary to look at it.<br/><br/><b><i>Am I human?</i></b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424840/#Comment_424840" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-26T15:06:40+00:00" title="November 26, 2013  3:06PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>WHOA.</b><br/><br/>That's weird and awesome at the same time?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_424842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424842/#Comment_424842" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-26T16:15:44+00:00" title="November 26, 2013  4:15PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 26, 2013 4:16PM by contracycle.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But IIRC, the V-K test was not primarily a measure of the answer given; it was aimed at detecting the physiological response to disturbing imagery.

But I am concerned about how specific your memory is in some areas and <br/>suspiciously vague in others. You were 9 but don't know what grade. You recall the question and <br/>multiple choices vividly but not the name of your teacher or the book in question. These have all <br/>the ear-marks of a dream or an implanted memory. My best advice would be to get your affairs in <br/>order and report for further testing ... or RUN!<br/><br/>  Aaron_S, you know this already but as a segue I'll point out the one glaring omission in your <br/>text: a scenario. The default Dread scenario, "Beneath A Metal Sky", could be re-purposed, as could <br/>others. Chad Wattler (<a href="http://www.morningskye.com/" rel="nofollow">www.morningskye.com</a>) has the Dread inspired games "Silent Memories" and <br/>"Lucid"; both of which push the Dread rules in different ways.<br/><br/>  Speaking of which, I've been thinking that the rules should reflect the specific scenario. It need <br/>not always be about "revealing the Replicants". The Blade Runner universe seems ripe for all sorts <br/>of stories. To that end, I've been thinking about alternatives to "Jenga" resolution. Something that <br/>emulates the rise and fall of tension that Jenga produces but on a quicker, smaller scale. Thus, a <br/>"fall" need not represent player expulsion; perhaps just the need to reveal a memory, secret or <br/>regret. I've been toying with a scenario idea that focuses on the themes of isolation and loneliness <br/>that pervade the movie. <br/><br/>  Anyway, my first notion was using dice or cards as a tallying system. Instead of pulling, you <br/>would roll or draw and the amount would be added to a running total. When the cards/dice exceed a certain number (21, 31, 50, whatever), it would be a "fall/collapse". The "fall" number would be lowered (to represent rising tension) and the tally would start fresh. Special rules could apply when the deck is depleted (automatic fall; end-game; etc). A face card could be counted as "0" but automatically add 10 to the next draw (increasing the randomness of the numbers; theoretically, a few bad draws <br/>could bring an early fall). Matching a drawn card with the last card in the discard pile (by number <br/>or suit) could be an auto-success. Specific cards could have special rules attached to them; perhaps <br/>specifically to a character's sheet; or perhaps to compel another player (eg. the Queen of Hearts <br/>compels another player to reveal a secret, any Jack compels another player to take an unnecessary risk).<br/><br/>  I hope to provide a few bare-bone scenario ideas soon, with a list of character options and situations to be thrown at the players/characters. A bullet-point list of potential situations/problems would be perfect for open sandbox play without having the game flounder or stall.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
