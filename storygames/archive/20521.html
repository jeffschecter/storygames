As a designer, I've typically stayed closer to the traditional side of the spectrum - there's a clear GM, characters tend to have special abilities or skills, they're all a group doing a particular thing, etc. All of my Ethos Engine games are this way (Vow of Honor, Hunt the Wicked, Belly of the Beast), and Cornerstone is mostly this way (there's a lot more player creative authority than in EE). <br/><br/>I've struggled for a long time on making a more "narrative" game (I know there's baggage around the word, don't know how else to describe it) that doesn't have a GM, that is designed more for collaborative storytelling, that generally plays out in one session, that has relatively freeform character and narrative control, etc. <br/><br/>Many discarded games and prototypes later, I started from scratch with Perseverant. And, I'm relatively pleased to say, the game works...ish. Because my home group (and core group of playtesters, some 20-odd people) tend to prefer my more trad designs, it is difficult to gauge the "fun" factor of this game. In other words, it isn't something that my normal circle of RPGers would enjoy playing more than once.<br/><br/>We've certainly had a couple of cool stories, and we've had some pretty obvious failures where the system broke down. But, I'm in a bit of a pickle that I don't know how to rectify without asking for outside help. So, that's where you guys come in (hopefully, if you have the time). <br/><br/><b>A brief on the game</b><br/><br/>Perseverant is a story game about survival. A group of players creates characters, defines their relationships, defines the Wilderness that they must face, and what their eventual goal is (it could simply be survive, it could be to get to a certain location, or to flee from another group, whatever). It has a pretty rigid scene structure, with a cycle between challenge and social scenes. <br/><br/>Characters face challenges, expend trait cards, and roll dice. Successes return the cards, failures don't. Complete group failure elicits more challenges in the future. There's some random / collaborative / group phases in which you create locations and challenge sources (some of which a few of you helped me to refine in a previous thread). <br/><br/><b>The problem</b><br/><br/>I don't know if my game is fun. I don't know if the themes are tied as elegantly as they could be. This is a new headspace for me, and I'm worried that I'm being too influenced by other story games that I like, and by my past designs. I'm not necessarily looking for suggestions on what to create or change, but I'm interested in knowing your opinion on whether or not the game is fun and well executed. <br/><br/>If not, perhaps why. <br/><br/>Thanks again for any time and comments, criticism especially. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.bendutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Perseverant-RPG-v0.7.pdf" rel="nofollow">Full game doc, v0.7, updated 3/10/16</a>.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450967/#Comment_450967" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-29T18:00:14+00:00" title="January 29, 2016  6:00PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What is the fun part of survival?<br/><br/>What is the fun part of playing something narrative?<br/><br/>What's the fun part of collaborative storytelling?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450968/#Comment_450968" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-29T18:10:18+00:00" title="January 29, 2016  6:10PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my experience if a game doesn't feel fun to you, it usually isn't to anyone else.

It is far from any state of completion, but I'm worried that I'm conflating my group's preferences with the game's inherent design. It is certainly an emotionally challenging game, which is something a lot of people I play with don't particularly care for. To be clear, I personally enjoy playing it, especially when everyone is firing on all cylinders - but I'm not sure that it automatically elicits the type of engagement I'm looking for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450973/#Comment_450973" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-29T18:56:42+00:00" title="January 29, 2016  6:56PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2016 7:00PM by Paul_T.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My initial thoughts were the same as Jason's: when someone says that they wrote a game, but it isn't super fun to play, that, well... it sounds like you've answered your own question!<br/><br/>However, I read through the game, and it seems pretty solid to me.

And more flavourful fictional material to inspire the players, as well.

I can't see offhand why that wouldn't be the case for your game, but in terms of "hooking" players this is something to look into.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bendutter" title="bendutter"><img alt="bendutter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nIUA15RZGEM8B.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bendutter">bendutter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450974/#Comment_450974" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-29T19:03:59+00:00" title="January 29, 2016  7:03PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2016 7:25PM by bendutter.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>My initial thoughts were the same as Jason's: when someone says that they wrote a game, but it isn't super fun to play, that, well... it sounds like you've answered your own question!</blockquote>\nToo true, as is often the case. This is actually the fourth iteration (v0.4) of this particular game, which in and of itself is an extension of many previous less fun failures. So, it is getting closer!\n<blockquote>However, I read through the game, and it seems pretty solid to me. I'm pretty sure *I* would enjoy playing it.

It grew out of playtesting, and hasn't been particularly well integrated into the text yet, I don't think. Initially I had it where the challenge was equal to the number of players, but that got kind of stale, so we added the randomizer to it and that gave it some additional tension that I personally found enjoyable. <br/><br/>I'll probably try to clarify or just fully integrate that into the core rules without hemming and hawing around with it.\n<blockquote>Aside from that, the optional rules seem pretty unnecessary, but I understand the desire to write them in. I'd encourage you to trim them away as you playtest more, however.</blockquote>\nYep, they're in there kind of as support for the playtest process as I go more and more public with this thing. If I find that a huge number of players always incorporate a particular option rule, then that'll probably become a core rule. When the game is complete I probably won't have any optional rules, or I'll just have a brief section in the back on how to customize the rules to your liking (although, to be fair, the audience for this game is probably better at such hacks than I am).\n<blockquote>What kinds of things went wrong in playtests? Hopefully you can somehow figure out whether it was a question of group engagement (i.e. your friends just aren't into this style of gaming) or something wrong with the game.</blockquote>\nWell in the first four iterations there were just mechanical things that went wrong (impossible to finish, people died way too often or not often enough, what happens if I try to do xyz?, etc). However for this version, there hasn't been any mechanical failings. The "fun" side of the failings was more like low engagement from the players, but it very well may be burnout from playing this thing several times in a short period of time. \n<blockquote>One final thing: the game seems step-by-step enough that you could try playtesting it on the forum. I would participate if you choose to do this.</blockquote>\nI very well may consider doing this. Thanks!<br/><br/>Ah, you ninja'd me regarding fun. Yes, that's what I'm getting at. There's a certain blandness that doesn't exist in some of my other favorite games that are similar (Fiasco is a good example, Downfall is another). <br/><br/>I think what helps mitigate that somewhat is the creation of the locations and the challenges. But, people can be kind of lazy with that and just think of very obvious things (that's what happens often in playtesting). I think having starting scenarios / characters as I mention a few times (very much WIP still) will help that as well. <br/><br/>As for incentivizing the conflict aspects - it is already pretty core without layering in additional rules. For example, every social scene has to either create camaraderie or conflict. A lot of the relationships that people make aren't particularly amiable, so, they tend to steer closer to conflict. And, the betrayal rules are essentially an "auto-win" for the one doing the betraying, which is as close to mechanical surety in this game as you can get. <br/><br/>But, I'm open to any other suggestions if I'm missing something. <br/><br/><b>Edit</b>: some of my formatting and quoting got garbled.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450976/#Comment_450976" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-29T19:53:46+00:00" title="January 29, 2016  7:53PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds cool!

An average challenge severity is like 3-4, so sometimes they'll end up with a Consequence and other times they'll end up with some successes. The 1d6 rule is certainly harder for fewer players, I'll admit to that. Not that I have put a lot of thought into it just now, but I can't come up with a very fast and elegant way to represent the challenge's severity based on the number of players. <br/><br/>Something like roll +/- number of players, maybe.

Another contender is a random first severity, and then each subsequent severity follows a pattern based on the group's success or not. <br/><br/>For example, a group rolls a 5 severity for their first challenge, and they succeed. It is now a 6 severity for every challenge until they fail. When they fail, it drops back to 5. When they fail again, it drops to 4, and so on. That way there's a bit of a natural equilibrium that's formed after the first roll. However, I haven't tested either way, so, we'll see.<br/><br/>Also, regarding the reference sheet, I've made a <a href="http://www.bendutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Perseverant-Quick-Start.pdf" rel="nofollow">Quick Start document</a> that is printer friendly and pretty compact that covers just about all of the rules (without examples).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451049/#Comment_451049" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-01T23:06:01+00:00" title="February  1, 2016 11:06PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 1, 2016 11:07PM by Paul_T.">edited February 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If your ideal severity is between half the number of players and twice the number of players, you could do something like this, which would feel familiar based on your existing rules:<br/><br/>To determine severity, roll two dice per player. Each 4-6 turns into one point of severity.<br/><br/>Or, if you care more about the lower limit, but no so much the upper:<br/><br/>Severity starts at half the number of players you have. (You can round up or down as you like.) Now, for the remaining number of players, roll two dice per player. Each 4-6 bumps the severity up by 1.<br/><br/>E.g. You have five players. You decide to round down, so severity starts at 2. Now roll 6 dice (two for each of the remaining players). You get 4 hits, so your severity is 2+4=6.<br/><br/>The equilibrium idea is also good. It might not feel as random (since you'll always know the severity of the upcoming challenge), but could be good in other ways (and the simplicity is nice).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bendutter" title="bendutter"><img alt="bendutter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nIUA15RZGEM8B.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bendutter">bendutter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451054/#Comment_451054" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-01T23:51:48+00:00" title="February  1, 2016 11:51PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, those are both good ideas.

Your "game reference" (Quick Start) pages at the bottom of the PDF are fantastic. More games should have such clear summaries!<br/><br/>2. Now that we're playing a bit, I'm still not sure I see enough incentive for betrayal and conflict. (This may be just a personal taste thing, of course, and I'm willing to keep looking for it as we play - maybe I just haven't seen it in action yet! - but it would nice if betrayal/conflict was key to the team surviving the mission. That might introduce a fun tension to the game, where you, as a player, are hoping to succeed and reach the goal, but the characters are being stupid and selfish and desperate.)<br/><br/>3.

I'm thinking about that, that would kill two birds with one stone. I'm also considering making Severity something that everybody rolls. Each player rolls 1d6. A result of 2 or 3 adds 1 severity, while a result of 1 adds 2 severity. A roll of 4+ adds no severity. A challenge must always have at least 1 severity. <br/><br/>Something like that, what do you think?<br/><br/>As for the Betrayal piece, I think it is still a pretty convincing element (the auto-win, in either case), but won't happen unless people are put under more stress. Higher challenge severity will certainly do that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451365/#Comment_451365" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-15T16:31:33+00:00" title="February 15, 2016  4:31PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 15, 2016 4:32PM by Paul_T.">edited February 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben, <br/><br/>See my comments in the play thread.

The point is that the more they work together / build relationships, the "easier" it should get. <br/><br/>But yeah, perhaps the severity is some step mechanic like we discussed upthread. Something like you roll for the first scene (or it is equal to the number of characters, or something), and then each scene that you overcome without a consequence you add 1 severity, and each scene you fail you subtract 1 severity to the next scene. <br/><br/>I think that would produce the arc and the equilibrium like we talked about before. <br/><br/>However, the other idea is to simply scale up the severity more and more toward the end. That's simpler, but I'd be worried of a 10 or 15 scene adventure.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bendutter" title="bendutter"><img alt="bendutter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nIUA15RZGEM8B.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bendutter">bendutter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451448/#Comment_451448" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-19T17:15:49+00:00" title="February 19, 2016  5:15PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unless my math is wrong (which is likely), rolling 1d6 per living character in a challenge scene, and counting 1-3 as +1 severity, and 1s as +2 severity, you'd have a 67% chance of getting at least 1 severity, and a 17% chance of getting 2 per person. <br/><br/>I think this would be mostly fitting, as an average challenge scene each person would need to contribute at least one success, sometimes two. <br/><br/>An easy, harsher version could be to <i>explode</i> on d6s, which ups the chances of adding more than 1 severity by a smidge.

Are you sure it doesn't make for too many low-Severity challenges, though?<br/><br/>My only play experience is our playtest, so I could be wrong. My sense so far is that our "group" of 3 players should not be facing challenges with a severity of 2. That's just borderline silly. The challenges in the 4-6 range have felt pretty good. (We lost the last one, but we could easily have won if we'd played it differently, even without going to the betrayal option.)<br/><br/>For starters, this new method would allow our group a 12.5% chance of a Severity of 0. That's silly. But maybe there's a reason you like the low-severity challenges which I don't know? We all have our quirks as designers.<br/><br/>I'm going to try [number of players] + [your formula above], and roll up a bunch of challenges. Let's see:<br/><br/>3<br/>4<br/>3<br/>4<br/>6<br/>3<br/>5<br/>7<br/>5<br/>6<br/>5<br/>5<br/>5<br/>5<br/>7<br/>3<br/>5<br/><br/>Hmmm! That range looks pretty good to me. What do you think? There's the possibility of really tough challenges, particularly with larger groups of players, which could be a bad idea (I don't know), although I like the idea of challenges which can't be defeated.<br/><br/>Again, my experience here is limited. But from our playtest, those sound like "fun" numbers. I don't know the math you've built the system on, however - maybe you have a different idea in mind in terms of how this game should go.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bendutter" title="bendutter"><img alt="bendutter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nIUA15RZGEM8B.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bendutter">bendutter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451470/#Comment_451470" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-21T01:33:21+00:00" title="February 21, 2016  1:33AM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quick clarification Paul, which formula did you use to get these numbers?

Currently, the game works well as a story-telling exercise, but I feel like it could be developed to be either more challenging/edgy (the rules hint at pushing for inter-character drama as a way to survive, which is an interesting tension, but I'm not sure it's strong enough right now to be an exciting <i>central feature</i> of the game) or, as Dave implies (perhaps), to focus more on the actual questions of survival, resources, decisions, locations, and disasters. Make those things real and visceral and in your face. As the game is written currently, all those things are just Colour (gloss), and we can play them up or down as much as we like. (We can narrate that we don't have medicine anymore, but it doesn't *really* matter to the success or failure of the expedition.)<br/><br/>So I think that those can be fruitful directions to explore in order to give the game a little more "zing"!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bendutter" title="bendutter"><img alt="bendutter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nIUA15RZGEM8B.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bendutter">bendutter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451527/#Comment_451527" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-21T23:23:19+00:00" title="February 21, 2016 11:23PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree on all points! <br/><br/>This quite succinctly hits on what I was feeling wasn't super "fun" about the game - it wasn't hitting the design cohesion I was aiming for. <br/><br/>So two things need to change:<br/><br/>1. Make the game more challenging overall. This will come from a combination of mechanically increasing severity, limiting the number of keyed cards available (max of two instead of three I think), and perhaps tap in to the description by the framer a bit more. <br/><br/>2.

It's nicely self-balancing.<br/><br/>You're talking about marrying the theme to the mechanics. Which themes are you trying to draw out?<br/><br/>I see a strong dichotomy between "let's make this challenging and let's make it force difficult choices on the group, as they struggle to work together" and "let's explore the trials of exploration and travel", and thinking in terms of which aspects of the design support each can be fruitful. (For instance, everything about character creation has to do with personalities and relationships, not exploration and survival.) <br/><br/>There may other directions this game could be focused in, as well. (And sometimes hybrid versions of seemingly unrelated priorities can still make for strong game design.) Those are just the two that jump out at me, and neither feels entirely fully supported. The game does have an enjoyable "here are some prompts to make up things about these people traveling" storytelling vibe to it, but it sounds like you're looking for something with a little more bite, right?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bendutter" title="bendutter"><img alt="bendutter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nIUA15RZGEM8B.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bendutter">bendutter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451530/#Comment_451530" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-21T23:30:56+00:00" title="February 21, 2016 11:30PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To answer my own question, perhaps I should change one of the character cards to "Resource" or "Item."

And looking at those threads makes me miss all those people who used to come hang out here.<br/><br/>Ben,<br/><br/>If you like the storytelling structure which the game provides, you don't NEED to cave to popular demand and make the game about something else. We're enjoying playing it on the forum, for instance.<br/><br/>I think the *easiest* change to make would be just to increase the level of threat/danger, and make the social conflict/betrayal rules a bit punchier, so we HAVE to engage with them in order to survive. (There could also be a question of "who makes it there alive" mixed in there, if desired.)<br/><br/>Personally, if I'm basically making stuff up with prompts, I like how challenges work, and how there's a strong incentive to having social scenes after the challenges. However, I would welcome it if conflicts and betrayals were forced upon us in the same way. They're interesting creative prompts and make for difficult decisions.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bendutter" title="bendutter"><img alt="bendutter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nIUA15RZGEM8B.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bendutter">bendutter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451546/#Comment_451546" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-22T15:34:21+00:00" title="February 22, 2016  3:34PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the "fun" of the game - to me - is in the collaborative story telling. I want the characters under pressure so that it hits the theme, but I don't need to cram theme down everybody's throat. So, I think we're close. Here are the proposed changes:<br/><br/><b>Severity</b><br/>Severity is determined by adding the number of players to the result of 1d6 per three players, rounded up. For example, a group with 4 players would start each challenge with a severity of 4 + 2d6, summed. <br/><br/>If the group rolled a 1 and a 3, the severity for the challenge would be 8 (4+1+3).<br/><br/><b>Trait cards</b><br/>I will replace Method (or Ideals, still on the fence) with Gear. This is a significant kit or collection of equipment or items that are relevant to the character (either their goal or their history), the nature of the Wilderness, and can not overlap with any other character. <br/><br/><b>Betrayal</b><br/>At any time during a scene, a character can Betray another character. This automatically reduces the challenge to 0 severity, and all of the Betraying character's spent cards are returned to their hand immediately. Internal conflict rules follow as normal. <br/><br/><b>Potential addition</b><br/>I'm thinking of adding another "stack" of cards - similar to Locations and Challenge Sources - that are a beneficial resource to the party. They might even be called "Resources." <br/><br/>What these Resources would do is essentially act as another keyable card for the character - although whether they were successful or not they're <i>always</i> spent and discarded. Each Resource card would be created at the beginning of the game (just like Locations and Challenge Sources), and would add another cool prompt for the player to try to incorporate "A delicacy from a distant land" and how that would help them solve the current challenge, or whatever. <br/><br/>As always, any card pulled from a stack could be rejected and shuffled back in if it absolutely made no sense for the scene at hand.<br/><br/>This makes the game a bit more chunky, rules wise, but I think goes a long way toward marrying the theme of perseverance through the wilderness, and dependence on one another to do so (and the social conflict inherent in that). <br/><br/>What do you guys think?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451551/#Comment_451551" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-22T16:32:38+00:00" title="February 22, 2016  4:32PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not *in love* with these changes, just reading about them "on paper", as it were. But that doesn't mean they aren't good - it's just my initial impression.<br/><br/>One major thing I'd love to see is more reason to use social conflict scenes. For instance, imagine the game this way (this is just off the top of my head):<br/><br/>* The game is set up so that not everyone makes it to the end of the expedition. Some characters will die or be lost along the way.<br/><br/>* Social scenes for camaraderie allow me to return someone *else's* cards to their hand. (I'm helping another.)<br/><br/>* Social scenes with conflict allow me to return my *own* cards to my hand (and perhaps have the possibility of creating a Setback or some such). (I'm helping myself at the expense of another.)<br/><br/>I don't know if that's great in its particulars, but building that kind of choice into how to deal with social scenes and the dynamics between the characters could give the game a little more punch, I think.<br/><br/>Right now, the choice to create conflict or not is almost purely freeform (when it seems right for the character), which could be a feature you want to preserve. If you want the game to remain more in the "play your character in a freeform scene and see where it takes you", that's valid, too. It gives us less to go on when thinking of it as a storytelling game, however.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bendutter" title="bendutter"><img alt="bendutter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nIUA15RZGEM8B.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bendutter">bendutter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451554/#Comment_451554" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-22T16:36:53+00:00" title="February 22, 2016  4:36PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's a good idea Paul. <br/><br/>I'm reticent to put too much structure around social scenes.

Even like a "roll 3d6 and pick the middle d6, add that to teh number of characters" or something. But, I'm not too worried about that right now.<br/><br/>I'm more worried about the introduction of Gear and Resources.<br/><br/>While I've thought some more about it - I want the focus to be firmly on the "character" side, but I also want the pressure of dwindling supplies and a tough natural obstacle to be important. So I think what I'll do, rather than introducing a "Gear" card for each character, is that each <i>player</i> creates one Resource card at the beginning of the game (just like Locations and Challenges), and then we stack them up.<br/><br/>At any time during a challenge scene a player can choose to draw a Resource card from the stack, except that it is a one-time shot. So you might have 2-5 scenes in which a resource could come in handy and add to its resolution, but they can't be used twice.<br/><br/>It also adds a nice wrinkle in which a character could get in trouble by pulling multiple resource cards in a row - the group didn't want them to use it now, but they just did, adding some additional ire.<br/><br/>As for the Social mechanics - I've already adopted that (as I was so close with conflict and camaraderie anyway, I just unified those into you gain a card or the other player gains a card, boom, simple. Thanks for the idea Paul).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451563/#Comment_451563" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-22T21:01:56+00:00" title="February 22, 2016  9:01PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's an idea:<br/><br/>You can risk Resources in conflicts (if they're not returned to your hand, they're gone for good, or something similar), but for each Resource you lose, +1 Severity to future challenges.<br/><br/>If there's a way to collect new Resources on the way, but rarely, that could be interesting.<br/><br/>Resources should be shared by the group, providing grist for conflicts. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bendutter" title="bendutter"><img alt="bendutter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nIUA15RZGEM8B.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bendutter">bendutter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451564/#Comment_451564" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-22T21:34:35+00:00" title="February 22, 2016  9:34PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 22, 2016 10:01PM by bendutter.">edited February 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's basically what I was going for. <br/><br/>So I'm thinking that during the early world-building stage players will come up with 1-2 Resources and set them aside as a communal stack. They have to fit with everything else, blah blah. And yeah, once they're spent they're spent. <br/><br/>For Severity, I'm thinking maybe some type escalating (it gets harder as they go on) type of progression. It could be something like:<br/><br/>- First 3 scenes: Severity = 1d6<br/>- Second 3 scenes: Severity = Num of players<br/>- Third 3 scenes: Severity = 1d6 + Num of players<br/><br/>Or some similar calculation. I was thinking another option would be like this:<br/><br/>- First 3: Severity = Lowest of 3d6<br/>- Second 3: Severity = Middle of 3d6<br/>- Third 3: Severity = Highest of 3d6<br/>After 9: Severity = Characters + Highest of 3d6<br/><br/>I'd have to do some math and playtesting, but my gut instinct is that would add a nice layer of tension but also keep it more predictable.<br/><br/><i>Update:</i> I did some math, and I'm really liking this so far:<br/><br/>First third: Lowest 1 of 3d6 + N of chars<br/>Second third: Middle 1 of 3d6 + N of chars<br/>Final third: Highest 1 of 3d6 + N of chars<br/><br/>For three characters, this hovers nicely around 4-5 in the first chunk, 6-7 in the middle chunk, and 8-9 in the third chunk. This also combines the nice tension of randomness, is easy to explain, and you always have at least as many severity as there are players. <br/><br/>For now, I think this will be the winner (until further playtesting).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451566/#Comment_451566" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-22T22:17:09+00:00" title="February 22, 2016 10:17PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that math, but I think you missed an important thing in my post above:<br/><br/>Having Resources means you don't need to worry about this kind of thing!

I'm still considering it though. I think the Resources being a type of card that they can use, and only use once, will automatically make each challenge more difficult without the need to increase the Severity. <br/><br/>That still doesn't account for a lack of severity difficulty. In your example, we might as well just say "increase severity by 1 for every challenge scene." But, again, that seems less "natural" to me. <br/><br/>I'll be honest, my brain is a bit mush on this subject at the moment, I'll give it some time and some playtesting to sort it out. Thanks though!<br/><br/>Any other comments on Resources or mechanics that can help hone the theme are always welcome.<br/><br/><i>Edit comment: Paul, I thought an easy way is just simply that every time a Resource is used (regardless of whether they succeeded or not) the Severity increases by 1. If you start with a set number (say equal to the number of characters) that makes it very easy to remember. I'll consider something like that, thanks again!</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451569/#Comment_451569" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-22T23:21:50+00:00" title="February 22, 2016 11:21PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben,<br/><br/>That's exactly what I mentioned earlier:\n<blockquote>Here's an idea:<br/><br/>You can risk Resources in conflicts (if they're not returned to your hand, they're gone for good, or something similar), but for each Resource you lose, +1 Severity to future challenges.<br/></blockquote>\nHowever, then I realized that if Resources dwindled over time anyway, you don't need to do any adjusting of Severity numbers.

It's a foe you can study, and if you read it right, you can prepare yourself before it's too late, which in turn can save your life.  That process utilizes various skills and includes various choices.  It also entails various costs, such as strains on your time and resources and mind and nerves.  Nature is a foe who travels with you, ever present, asking you whether you're paying attention and prepared enough, every second of every day.  For all the ways in which nature is partly predictable, it is never <i>completely</i> predictable, and could always ambush you.  <br/><br/>If you're in a group, who is responsible for doing these tasks and shouldering these burdens?  Who can do it best?  Who can handle it best without breaking?  How do we share, the good and the bad?<br/><br/>Nature is also a foe you can't trick or fight or reason with, so when it hits, the enemies you <i>can</i> fight are internal -- exhaustion of the mind and will, inattention, frustration, despair, impatience, panic, dread, and existential crises about meaning and identity.<br/><br/>That's what first comes to mind, anyway.

The survival of the expedition isn't at stake, and the players aren't thinking about solving problems or exploration. Rather, the survival and expedition color is a backdrop for interpersonal drama.<br/><br/>One other thing which might be really interesting for this game is giving a reason for certain characters being <i>more or less valuable in different situations</i>.<br/><br/>As it stands, the Traits are so broad that they can pretty much always be brought in (or not). That's nicely balanced by you risking them when you use them.<br/><br/>However, applying how Resources and/or Traits (it doesn't have to be Traits, it could be a different way, like simply listing characters' positions in the expedition or some other "soft mechanic" expression of the idea) work to fight challenges could help create some guidance for "which characters are invaluable and which aren't". This, in turn, can be good grist for the "interpersonal challenge" mill: who's important and who's disposable? We can argue about it. "Hey, we're going to have to cross the raging river. We can't do it without Jim!"<br/><br/>As for the Resource issue, I saw the difference you mentioned (I prefer risking Resources, myself, as that has more narrative possibilities than just using them up each time, which is always essentially narrated the same way - "Ok, I guess we've used the last of our food now..."). That's not what I was trying to point out, though: I think the exciting and elegant application is dwindling resources over time, so you don't have adjust Severity numbers upwards.<br/><br/>Speaking purely for myself, I'm perfectly happy to apply any rules changes you want to try in the middle of our playtest, no problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451592/#Comment_451592" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-23T06:08:04+00:00" title="February 23, 2016  6:08AM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2016 6:09AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The survival of the expedition isn't at stake, and the players aren't thinking about solving problems or exploration.</blockquote>Huh.

Skills, resourcefulness, ideals, motivation, relationships, whatever. You can't outmight or outmaneuver Nature, but you can overcome it through will and determination. To me, the game isn't about preparation - but rather what the expedition does in spite of being prepared (or not). <br/><br/>Paul, the expedition is definitely at stake. There is a section in the rules called "Finishing Our Story" in which I touch on if everybody is dead or defeated - the game just ends and you don't achieve your goal. That's a very real possibility (and has happened in a playtest, actually) even without betrayal and social conflict.<br/><br/>On the other hand, social conflict can help or hinder the group's success. There's certainly a possibility that if you betrayed a comrade in one scene, the group would succeed and move on, but that character would be dead. Would the survivors resent the traitor who killed their comrade? Who knows.<br/><br/>As for role-specificity, that might be neatly folded into "History." What, if anything, is a unique specialty or skill or area of expertise that only your character has. And what would the journey look like if that character died or became incapacitated? I think that's already implied, to an extent, but bears (perhaps) further elaboration in the rules.<br/><br/>So, I think what <i>I</i> want the game to be about (whether I executed well upon it or not is another matter) is pretty much an even blend of what Paul and David are suggesting. The struggle is the backdrop, but it also drives the conflict. The conflict helps the party move through the struggle, but the struggle and Nature is very much a real threat.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bendutter" title="bendutter"><img alt="bendutter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nIUA15RZGEM8B.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bendutter">bendutter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451608/#Comment_451608" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-23T18:32:26+00:00" title="February 23, 2016  6:32PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Resources</b><br/><br/>I'm thinking I will use this as a stack, just like locations, as discussed up thread. To start, I think each player makes only one, and if keyed and successfully used they can return to the stack for the group to continue using.<br/><br/>(Tentative): in any scene in which the challenge was overcome without anyone rolling a fail (perhaps too harsh, maybe without anyone earning a setback), the group earns one new resource that is befitting of that scene. I want it to be exceptionally rare, as I want resources to dwindle as they go through their journey.<br/><br/><b>Trait cards</b><br/><br/>I'll keep these the same for now, but with a nod in the rules toward making each character very distinct in terms of what they can do. <br/><br/><b>Severity</b><br/><br/>Here's another contender that I quite like, that doesn't have a lot of shenanigans or conditional rules or whatever.\n<blockquote>Roll 1d6. If the result is lesser than or equal to the number of players, add this result to the number of players. This is the scene's severity. If the result is greater than the number of players, this is the scene's severity.<br/><br/>For example, a group of 3 characters rolls with a result of 3. Their challenge scene's severity is 6 (3+3). Later, the same group rolls a 4. This challenge scene's severity is 4 (as 4 is greater than 3). </blockquote>\nThis keeps it nice and easy, only 1d6 roll, and it averages around 1.6 challenge severity per player per scene regardless of the number of players (I did some brute force crunchy math with lots of rolls, but I'm sure there's a way to calculate it in anydice or something).<br/><br/>You get a bit of uncertainty, and you know that you'll never have severity less than your group.

I had somewhat overlooked them, since they include rules like "your character cannot die without your consent", and losing ALL your keyable cards (i.e. "dying" or being defeated at least four-five times) sounds incredibly unlikely to me, given what I've seen of the game. I could be wrong, of course! But my impression is that character death and defeat is more of a story concern than a "survival of the expedition" concern, generally. (Contrast that to a hypothetical version of Perseverant where only one character is guaranteed to make it to the end alive!)<br/><br/>The reason your Traits don't cover necessary skills and important character roles is because they are too freeform. I can use any Trait in any situation, including Relationships, barring some really unusual circumstances. I can barely *imagine* an instance of play where keying a certain card would be ruled out.<br/><br/>That's a very different process than, say, having a challenge which literally cannot be defeated if Alhazren is left behind. So, I don't feel that tension in the game at all: how many cards you use is a "game" choice (manipulating risk/reward) and which cards you use is a storytelling concern. As written, I don't think this mechanic will ever generate that kind of tension. That's fine as-is (and lots of fun to play), but if you want to introduce that kind of challenge, you'll have to change something about the design.<br/><br/>Challenges producing Resources from time to time (but only rarely) is an excellent addition, I think. I like your idea of attaching it to succeeding particularly well in a challenge (e.g. no failures). Another idea might be to include it as a character option: we intentionally try to secure Resources during the challenge, at some cost to our overall odds of success. (e.g. dice now generate failures on 1-4 instead of 1-3, or some such)<br/><br/>That kind of thing creates an interesting sense of cause and effect between scenes and challenges - "Oh, good thing we got that thing from the earlier challenge, because now we have the perfect thing for this one!"<br/><br/>I'd even be tempted to rewrite your game to be *all* about Resources, but some are Personal (and can even include things like "courage" or "determination" or "ideals" or "health", perhaps, if you want to keep the character focus) and some must be shared by the group and risked in challenges.<br/><br/>I could even see challenges threatening particular resources. We generate a challenge and we see that if we lose, we will have to go forward without our Food and without our Pack Animals. Oh shit! We'd better not lose this one...<br/><br/>Choosing one Resource to be threatened per point of Severity rolled or some such could be a way to do it, or you could let people bring them in for bonuses, risking them in the process, as it happens now with Traits.<br/><br/>I like that idea for a Severity roll: that's slick and elegant. If you like the numbers it produces, use it! (It might be too high for small groups, and too low for large groups, for example.) Procedurally, it's great.<br/><br/>(EDIT: Just ran the numbers. The range of average Severity is pretty nice: from a maximum of 2/player (with two players) to a minimum of 1.58 per player (with six). So, it looks good on paper. But those are still big gaps! With two players, with both have to generate two successes to win. With six, if the first four or five generate two successes, the sixth doesn't even need to roll. My gut feeling here is that Severity should scale *precisely* based on the number of players, but, who knows, maybe this is close enough!)<br/><br/>There's lots of other ways to balance # of players vs. Severity, as well. For instance, Severity can be fixed, but the resources of the players can be limited. Examples:<br/><br/>* The group's shared Resources scale DOWN as a function of increasing player numbers.<br/>* A player's Traits/Resources scale DOWN as a function on increasing player numbers.<br/>* The number of players who can act during any given challenge is fixed.

It is quite easy to become defeated or die in game - you can do it in a single round. Imagine if you key all of your cards, and then roll all failures. You're defeated (or dead). Not that hard. Also imagine if you haven't had enough social scenes, and you go into a scene with only 1 or 3 cards left, and the same thing happens. <br/><br/>Remember too that Setbacks compound the issue. Once you get a Setback, one of your cards becomes blocked until you go through a separate challenge severity to overcome it, or a social scene in which another character overcomes it for you. Setbacks aren't that hard to get (Alhazren got one in our playtest game, for example). If you got a few unlucky rolls and a few setbacks, even if you did everything "right" in terms of social scenes, you could easily die in the next challenge scene.<br/><br/>And, by the way, "defeat" is effectively "removed from the story." So, in that regard, it is akin to death, just with the option of the character reappearing at an interesting time in the narrative.\n<blockquote>The reason your Traits don't cover necessary skills and important character roles is because they are too freeform.

So, that's fine, and intentional.\n<blockquote>I'd even be tempted to rewrite your game to be *all* about Resources, but some are Personal (and can even include things like "courage" or "determination" or "ideals" or "health", perhaps, if you want to keep the character focus) and some must be shared by the group and risked in challenges.</blockquote>\nThis is a cool idea, but pretty far from what I'm going for I think. And, when I squint, my game sort of is already like that - you have your four traits and relationships, which are all personal "resources" in a way. But, an interesting spin on it!\n<blockquote>There's lots of other ways to balance # of players vs. Severity, as well. For instance, Severity can be fixed, but the resources of the players can be limited.<br/></blockquote>\nYep, those are some good ideas as well. I wouldn't want anything to take away from the pressure of creating social scenes for replenishment, but I also don't want the group scale to become a monster of a problem.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451612/#Comment_451612" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-23T20:11:16+00:00" title="February 23, 2016  8:11PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (There's nothing wrong with your Death rules, I just haven't seen them in play yet so it sounds distant and unthreatening. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> But if "defeat" means I can come back later in the story, that still sounds like my participation in the expedition is basically up to me - I can choose to die, or not.

We can make a stack of resource cards at the beginning of our game similarly to locations or challenge sources.<br/><br/>Each player makes one resource, reading them aloud and vetoing any as a group. These resources should be meaningful and inspiring - nothing so mundane as Food or Lanterns. During our story, any one of us can pull a resource from the stack, which is then keyed like any other character card. <br/><br/>The resource is expended if we roll a fitting failure or earn a setback, and that resource can\u2019t be used again. A resource that was used without failure is returned to the stack, and can be used again. Only one resource can be used per scene. <br/><br/>If we overcome a challenge scene without rolling any failures (no d6 rolls under 4 in our group), then we can earn a new resource. At the end of the scene we create this resource from the context of the scene. <br/><br/>EXAMPLE RESOURCE<br/><br/><i>Ben pulls the A Rare Delicacy resource from the stack, incorporating it into his description as a peace treaty, and rolls an additional d6.</i><br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bendutter" title="bendutter"><img alt="bendutter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nIUA15RZGEM8B.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bendutter">bendutter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451744/#Comment_451744" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-03T18:11:35+00:00" title="March  3, 2016  6:11PM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm still pretty much on the fence about incorporating the Resource stack as "core" rules or not. <br/><br/>Anyone have any inclination?

In other words, the player chooses if the resource is expended or not, based upon what occurred in the fiction (just like any character card).\n<blockquote>If the idea is to include a dwindling list of colourful narrative details into our expedition, this should do the trick.<br/><br/>* If the idea is to make the players wonder about what they have to bring and how they might to survive under specific conditions, it doesn't do that at all.

The second point is touched upon during the creation phase, where the players have to decide <i>which</i> resources are created, and as such steering their character's "preparation" in that regard. <br/><br/>What I'm worried about is adding too much complexity to the initial collaborative phase, as it can be quite taxing to build out all of these lists (sharing it as a group makes it less so, but, I've seen it in playtesting even without Resource cards).<br/><br/>Without a major overhaul of how cards work - like your suggestion that everything is a Resource upthread - I'm hard pressed to come up with an elegant solution other than the Resource Stack. If I did want to pump up the "preparation" aspect a bit more, do you think I could do that with some modification to the proposed Resource stack rules here?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451748/#Comment_451748" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-03T19:14:13+00:00" title="March  3, 2016  7:14PM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 3, 2016 7:15PM by Paul_T.">edited March 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think you can get around the big wall of placing more constraints on the freedom of narration here...<br/><br/>As the game is, anyone can basically narrate anything they want at any time, justifying any Resources or Traits or whatever else they want. That's great for a storytelling game. It's no good for a game where you struggle with survival and only the prepared make it.<br/><br/>Do you want this, for instance, to be possible: a situation where the expedition loses their [resource], and that means they are now totally screwed? You can't get that with the current rules.<br/><br/>As for things "bloating" the game, I don't think that's a concern. You just remove the same amount of other things to keep the balance where you like it. For instance, if you have to deal a bunch of Resources, you shouldn't have BOTH four Traits per character AND several Relationships. Instead, reduce the Traits and/or Relationships, and replace them with Resources, so the ratio of available cards stays the same. <br/><br/>After that, it's all about implementation.<br/><br/>"Fitting failure" still sounds awfully vague to me. (e.g. I would have no idea how it apply it in-game.)

I'm hoping this tips section helps clarify / justify some of my thinking on the game and makes for a better experience, especially for the facilitator. <br/><br/>Anyway, any thoughts and external playtest feedback is always appreciated!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20521/perseverant-my-mechanics-work-but-im-not-sure-if-theyre-fun" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20521/perseverant-my-mechanics-work-but-im-not-sure-if-theyre-fun" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20521/perseverant-my-mechanics-work-but-im-not-sure-if-theyre-fun/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F20521%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F20521%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
