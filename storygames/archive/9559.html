Turning it into a game about <a href="http://www.meekmok.com/games/rpg/civilwar/" rel="nofollow">superheroes during the Civil War </a>is probably the furthest from stock we've gone, but we've bent the core rules to play Firefly, zombie apocalypse, and lots of other stuff.  The actual hackage involves writing genre-specific Keys and Secrets for the most part, and occasionally figuring out how to handle things way outside the game's core conceit, like power beyond human scale and firearms.  <br/><br/>We have always liked the rules and their implied extensibility.  They've been very popular and become our "house system" - something several players really wanted, disliking having to learn new rules all the time.  <br/><br/>In terms of value, I'd say that our experience over several years and many play sessions demonstrates the pickup-truck-like nature of the base Solar System rules, and the availability of Eero's revision makes what we've been doing even easier.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ignotus" title="Ignotus"><img alt="Ignotus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ignotus">Ignotus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212098/#Comment_212098" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-13T06:54:33+00:00" title="June 13, 2009  6:54AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've made a Don't Rest Your Head hack called Hellbound that I've run twice now, about people descending into hell in search of mystic secrets, lost loves, and other quixotic ambitions.  I generally find DRYH an intimidating game to run, requiring as it does juggling several storylines with a minimum of prep while producing an endless stream of nightmare imagery.  I made Hellbound to provide no-prep, low-stress phantasmagoria that can be enjoyed in one evening.<br/><br/>Hellbound is GMless.  Each player takes turns being the pilgrim; the player on their right is Leviathan, who frames scenes, controls the environment, and introduces NPCs, while the player on their left is the Cenobite, who plays antagonist npcs as well as being able to introduce a special demon made during character generation and charged with the character's downfall (other named NPCs are played by players who wouldn't otherwise be in the scene).<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, the players create Hell together, and once they have a concept, they draw a map, with each player adding three locations (which consist of an evocative name and a mysterious scratchy little picture).  The most recent game of Hellbound featured a tiered hell, with an infernal subway system giving way to maintenance tunnels, built on top of mysterious catacombs, which were in turn built atop caverns in the bowels of the earth.  Each player's cenobite decides where on the map they're trying to reach.<br/><br/>As characters travel through Hell, and as the DRYH system takes its toll on them, they may have to bargain with the cenobite to survive - signing away pieces of their souls, or trading away narrative control of their past or future in return for opportunities to spend hope coins, which are few and far between.<br/><br/>I've played Hellbound twice now, once as victorian spiritualists, and once as a New York artist colony, and it's been very successful in producing baroque imagery and creepy stories without prep while spreading out the burdens and pleasures of coming up with cool stuff evenly around the table.  In particular, we've really enjoyed making and having the map, which unifies the game's mood, provides ideas for individual scenes, and helps provide shape to the characters' journies.  The hack still needs work, however - for some reason, the structure of the game seems to be keeping people to a relatively low number of rolls, so the DRYH death spiral mechanics don't really kick in... time to add a lot more opportunities to  gain exhaustion and check off fight/flight responses.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212114/#Comment_212114" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-13T09:07:08+00:00" title="June 13, 2009  9:07AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm running a hacked version of 316.<br/><br/>First, because I was horrified to discover the alien forms table did not include octopoid creatures (or as I prefer to call them, tentacle monsters)!

Prior to that, "Asskickers of the Fantastic" dominated my hacked game time. Originally welded together from Top Secret but eventually based on Twilight: 2000, it's the story of insane urban supernatural hunters who have combination bus pass/heavy weapons permits because the city does not feel it's safe for them to drive. Each character was required to have one psychic power that really works but isn't useful (can teleport, but always 30,000 feet up). Sort of Ghostbusters fused to A-Team.<br/><br/>The original Top Secret hack worked the best because the opening scene was always the phone ringing with a new mission, which immediately led to the Possession Combat subsystem.<br/><br/>Adventures included:<br/><br/>"The Hunchback of the Terry Fox Memorial" (turned out to be a homeless guy)<br/>"Werewolves of BC Place" (a Michael Jackson concert gone horribly wrong, embarassing the mayor)<br/>"The Shadow Over Ambleside" (strange new shoes in the Woodwards footwear department for people with chronic foot disorders diagnosed by one Doctor C.T.Hulhu)<br/>"Cola Zombies" (turns out they could be destroyed only with 7-Up)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212121/#Comment_212121" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-13T10:43:07+00:00" title="June 13, 2009 10:43AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I have this homebrew D&amp;D thing called "Swords Against Fate."

I have two different houserule mechanics for <i>Vampire</i> to make Humanity a punchier, more-central system.<br><br>The first is called Torment, and basically involves a new trait that builds up as a vampire commits inhuman acts, and depending on the relationship between Humanity and Torment, can take away character control as the PC is forced to confront their loss of humanity, and rewards players for bringing the theoretical focus of the game back to the forefront.<br><br>The second is called Seven Deadly Sins, Three Deadly Memories. The short version is this: the player takes 10 notecards and writes the seven deadly sins (conveniently, the three Vices of NWoD games) on the back of seven of them and then "Memory" on the other three. Then on the front of the Sin cards, they write a little bit of character history or detail pertaining to that sin, some dark secret or regretted act that ties to that. So for "Greed", a player might write "I lied and said I didn't know what had happened to the baby's college fund; the truth was, it had gone up my veins" The Memory cards have the characters three most humanizing memories written on them; the times when they felt the most alive. Then as they lose Humanity, the notecards are flipped to the side showing the bit of history, and in order to recover Humanity, they have to make acts of contrition that relate the the story, and then add a bit more detail to it. When the memory cards are flipped over, the character actually loses all memory of that event, since they have grown too monstrous to relate.<br><br/>I'm also in the process of hacking <i>Mage</i> and <i>Werewolf</i> into oracle-style games, with <i>Ghost/Echo</i> as my inspiration. Basically I want to strip out the 300-odd pages of tediousness from both games and get at the meaty nuggets of brilliance in them that attracted me in the first place.<br/><br/>I also have hacked <i>D&amp;D</i> in its various incarnations in simple ways to encourage fast and fun play, mostly by stripping out rules entirely and re-jigging the experience system to reward the things in play that I enjoyed (creative tactical thinking, clever use of environments, being either epically cool or epically silly) instead of just smash smash smash,                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212417/#Comment_212417" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-15T14:30:48+00:00" title="June 15, 2009  2:30PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a season of Torchwood: Ahmedabad this spring using Prime Time Adventures, and for the second season, I've decided to get rid of the parts of the system which were acting as dead weight, and make it better support the action mode which things evolved into. As a result, I'm hacking PTA with bits of Inspectres and Unknown Armies, and replacing the cards with dice to support VOIP play, and a bit of my own (likely) out-there system design. Here is what I sent my players for refining their characters for season 2:\n<blockquote>I'm also re-working the system to be a bit more focused on what <br/>characters put at risk and on the torchwood team as a whole.<br/><br/>Each Torchwood Player Character will have the following persistent <br/>features:<br/><br/>* Concept - short phrase that sums up your character's role on the team <br/>or identity<br/><br/>* Edges - character aspects<br/><br/>* Contacts - character relationships <br/><br/>* Stress Categories - these are fixed from the list: Alien, <br/>Relationship, Self, and Violence<br/>-- Alien - involes stress to the team as a whole, including Resources  (team Edges)<br/>-- Relationship - involves stress to your Contacts and other people you care about<br/>-- Self - involves stress to your identity and Concept<br/>-- Violence - involves stress to your person, often physically, impairing your Edges You choose one of these to be vulnerable, and one of these to be strong, the other two are normal.<br/><br/>Torchwood characters will also have:<br/><br/>* Screen Presence - a rating which varies by episode indicating your base dice pool and significance this episode. It goes from 1 (minor role) to 3 (star).<br/><br/>* Stress Ratings - a rating which varies during each episode for each stress category from zero up to your screen presence. The higher it goes the more risk you have from that category.<br/><br/>* Fanmail - the applause you gain (from the other players) for doing cool stuff.<br/><br/>Note, unlike the previous rules, Concept can now be spent, like an Edge or a Contact. And it is possible to gain new Edges and Contacts during play. Each of them can be spent up to twice an episode.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vasco%20Brown" title="Vasco Brown"><img alt="Vasco Brown" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/720dbb7653b3d0bf450544cf2959a255.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vasco%20Brown">Vasco Brown</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212523/#Comment_212523" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-16T01:39:25+00:00" title="June 16, 2009  1:39AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2009 1:52AM by Vasco Brown.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Since December our group has been playing a low-fanasty campaign inspired by George RR Martin's "Song of Ice an Fire" novel series. Lots of noble houses, blood-feuds, marching armies, banners, illicit romance, manipulation and political machinations. Fun stuff really. We started out using the Polaris system as written, but over the course of five 'chapters' (nine currently) we ended up drifting the rules considerably. The most notable changes were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We pared down and replaced the ritual phrases to three choices that fit our play style [Request Additional Detail, Negotiate, or Veto (Block or Let Fate Decide)]</li>\n<li>Although we kept the 'distributed GM' aspect, our play most resembles uber-troupe play in that there is little in the way of character ownership, as anyone can play any character from scene to scene. It resembles Capes to a certain extent in this fashion. Of the forty odd named characters in the story, more than half of them could be considered 'PCs' in a traditional sense.</li>\n<li>We apply 'Experience' whenever the group thinks it's relevant rather than by a die roll.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have <a href="http://www.vascobrown.com/rpg/wiki/ChroniclesOfTheRealm/System" rel="nofollow">a rough write-up</a> of the rules we're using on my wiki.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>As  far as hacks that exist only in our heads, for a while I have been bouncing around an idea for another Polaris hack that focuses on generating myth-like or 'mythopoetic' narratives. I'm specifically thinking of stories in the vein of JRR Tolkien's Silmarillion, specifically because Tolkien's drawing on Greek, Norse, Welsh and Celtic mythology, Christian mysticism and Arthurian legend is the sort of syncretic feel I'm shooting for and all hits the right notes for me. That isn't to say you couldn't do these same with say the Ramayana or Gigamesh epics as far as inspirations go.</p>\n<p>I'm thinking that Polaris as written would work well with a few adjustments taken from In A Wicked Age. Specifically, that each session, or 'tale', would be stand-alone to the extent that the aim would be reach their conclusion in one sitting.There would be no requirement to tell tales in any particular sequence, chronological or otherwise. A group could jump back and forth telling tales in any preferred order, discovering the fabric of their shared mythology as they went.</p>\n<p>However, there would be a critical requirement that each tale feature at least one linking Aspect or character introduced in a previous tale, thus establishing an element of continuity, ala IAWA. This way you could get cool things like a doom placed on a hero for defying the gods in one tale causing the fall of a great kingdom ruled by the hero's distant ancestor in another tale.</p>\n<p>A group could tell any number of tales they desired, though they might consider a particular 'cycle' finished once they've managed to hit an agreed upon number of tales in each of the several 'ages' or phases of the narrative. These ages might be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Age of Gods</strong> - This would deal with establishment the cosmology and the conflict and interactions among the gods; this is where we'd get our cool creation myths and fundamental aspects of the world that would end up heavily influencing later tales.</li>\n<li><strong>The Age of Gods and Men</strong> or <strong>The Age of Heroes</strong> - All those awesome tales of heroics, feats of renown, kingdoms established and thrown down? They go here.</li>\n<li><strong>The Age of Men</strong> - Divine influence has all but left the world, men are left to their own devices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm also tempted to graft the Best interests and GM framework from IAWA onto this hack as well, in order the facilitate the inter-PC conflict that works so well in that game. However, I'd have to think more on how the ritual phrases would work in under that setup. Perhaps the person you call "On No You Fucking Don't Asshole" on counts as your 'Mistaken' for the sake of the ritual phrases?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212984/#Comment_212984" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-17T13:10:57+00:00" title="June 17, 2009  1:10PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My recording equipment is en route, but I was planning on starting a podcast on exactly this topic.  Any objection to me stealing the name "Hack City"?  I was going to call it RPGDrift, but Hack City might have less baggage.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main topic of the podcast would be using systems, modifying rules, etc., to get the type of play you want.  It'd be an entirely non-judgemental approach where all approaches to a game are seen as correct in so far as they are what the participants desire.  It'd likely also include interviews with traditional gamers after their experiences with these hacked in ideas or their exposure to new games.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for my own Hacks, the first thing that popped into my head for Vampire was to add "Say 'yes' or roll dice."  Just reading the rules there are so many moments that call for opposed rolls to determine the results and I almost wanted to scream "Why!?" at the book.  So Hack #1 is no dice rolling to determine results unless someone calls for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm still working on a way to integrate best interests in Vampire as well.  Perhaps it would be best if also combined with some elements of Jared Sorensen's Monster Garage hack in the Chronicler's Guide.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin" title="Kropotkin"><img alt="Kropotkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin">Kropotkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213020/#Comment_213020" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-17T15:39:40+00:00" title="June 17, 2009  3:39PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 17, 2009 3:49PM by Kropotkin.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We almost always end up with a homebrew system.  Before discovering the indie gaming scene we used homebrews based on FUDGE and Chaosium's Basic Roleplaying system.  I've also got a houseruled version of AD&amp;D 1E which I messed with last year just to simplify the system to the point to where I'd feel comfortable running it.<br/><br/>Right now we're about to start playing this sci-fi police-noir thing which we're calling <b>The 9th Division</b>.  The rules we're using are a hack that takes bits we like from Primetime Adventures, Rob Donahue's Wheel of Fate, Hot War, Minimus, and Amagi Games' Metasystem.  We've modfied it so that system is gmless.  Each player has a protagonist and several npcs for which they're responsible.  Each player frames a scene for their protagonist and selects someone to provide adversity for the scene--although often we just volunteer.  The scene framing also usually starts coming more intuitively, and we eventually abandon any strict order.  We'll just go with whoever has an idea for a scene.  We're a pretty cohesive group as there's usually only three of us.  It's worked for us really well.<br/><br/>In the Ninth Division game I'll be playing a female android cop who works with a midget psychic gene-mod and an ex-military fixer type whose got an antique cybernetic eye.  Thematically were looking to get into Blade Runner / Gattaca / Minority Report territory. <br/><br/>We ran an X-Men game a while back which used this system, and we had some awesome unexpected stuff happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213069/#Comment_213069" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-18T00:33:04+00:00" title="June 18, 2009 12:33AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I was GMing a Swedish BRP-based game called <i>Mutant</i>. It's post-apocalyptic and stuff. Sort of like Gamma World. And the campaign I was running had all these skirmish-like battles. Since the original system was crap (we hacked it considerably just to make it function reasonably) and completely incapable of handling a battle with 20-40 participants, I created my own subsystem called <i>Plutonen</i> ("The Platoon"). It's awesome.<br/><br/>Basically, all the enemies are abstracted away and instead there are only goals. You roll skill rolls to get points towards accomplishing the goals and different goals have different risk values. Also, they can have a bunch of different effects. Friendly troops are abstracted to dice: D6s for regular troops, D8s for veterans and D10s for elites.<br/><br/>It works wonders with the big combats and it's totally creative. It sounds sorta like this:<br/><br/>GM: OK, so their reinforcements are going to arrive in three rounds, at which point all the risk values will go up by three.<br/>Player: I wanna delay them!<br/>GM: That's pretty risky. Let's set up "Delay the reinforcements" as a goal and put that at ... 5 points to accomplish at a risk value of 5/2. If you fill it, you delay them one turn. You can fill it every turn, if you want to, but that's gonna take some heroics or a lot of people.<br/><br/>Basically, the players come up with the goals and the GM interprets them in the mechanics. It's creative and massively fun, as well as smooth. I'm thinking of making it its own game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213177/#Comment_213177" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-18T11:34:30+00:00" title="June 18, 2009 11:34AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2009 11:36AM by David Artman.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In as-I-remember-them order:<br/>* At last year's Trinoc*coN, used the <i>IAWA</i> Oracles as written to run it in a modern game, just by slightly reinterpreting some of the terms that came up.<br/><br/>* Hacked <i>Shadowrun</i> (first edition) to make all of the resolution systems parallel in procedure and general results. Included (expensive) tech for instantiating programs into the real world, similar to Elementals' powers, so that Deckers culd do something other than run in parallel witht he rest of the team. Ditto for small mecha suits, so Riggers did more than idle the car out back of the scene. Turns out someone at FASA is psychic, because many of my system streamlining and changes appeared in Second Edition in one form or another (note that this was pre-Internet, so I didn't exactly have a forum for airing them to the world).<br/><br/>* Got sick of spell memorization in <i>AD&amp;D</i> (first edition) and instead calculated "spell points" from the spells per day per level charts. E. Gary Gygax released an article in Dragon about "mana" several months later. I was spooked (again, pre-Internet; and I hadn't mailed a letter to Dragon with my idea).<br/><br/>* Intend to run one or more old D&amp;D modules using MageKnight: each player get 200 points to build an "army," but 150 of them MUST go into a single figure and its artifacts and/or spell book; the rest goes into "retainers" (humanoid figures) or "pets" (monsters; AKA "Spawn"). This will give two actions per turn, which should reduce the "act... rest... act" pattern inherent in using only one figure per player. Or maybe I'll throw out the action points and pushing rules--needs playtesting. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>* One can't really "hack" <i>HERO System</i> so much as constrain it, but I once ran a campaign based on a concept for a sci fi novel I wanted to write, by providing an EXTENSIVE Campaign Sheet, complete with Active Point limits, required Limitations for most powers (or required Special Effects idioms, to suit the game world), and additional skills not in the book (mainly to do with the FTL drive I'd <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">invested</span>stolen from Delany.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213184/#Comment_213184" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-18T11:57:23+00:00" title="June 18, 2009 11:57AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Don't Rest In Shadows </b>is my young-adult-fantasy game that revolves around power, responsibility and risk.
