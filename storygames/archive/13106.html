The deal is - if they release a revised edition, you can return your well-loved copy of, say, <i>Don't Rest Your Head</i> to them. They will "cancel" it and trade it for a new version at a discount. The canceled game is then given away to a library or game club, of which Italy has many.<br/><br/>This is a tremendously cool idea and as a Janus-affiliated designer I really, really like it.<br/><br/>I only read Google Italian, so I have some questions, vipers - what's the discount/rebate? How will you determine which library/club gets a used book? Does the cancellation have to happen in person?

We'll give a more definite answer soon, but in the meantime we can say that it'll be a very substantial discount: it'll save the people who "upgrade" quite a bit of cash... and the new edition is (dare I say) <i>fucking cool</i>: not just a reprinting but new graphics, new contents and more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe swap has to happen in person: people that come to our booth at cons and fairs will see their copy being canceled before their eyes, stamped as "not for sale" with a spiffy rubber stamp (and maybe a corner cut in the interior flap of the cover).<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, clubs (and libraries) will need to contact us to make arrangements, plus the "scene" is pretty well connected over the internet, and we'll seek libraries on our own, too. It's a bit clunky, but hey, Italian bureaucracy, we have standards to keep up to!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, one last thing: Don't Rest Your Head will be our "test case". We'll see how it goes, if there is interest from our customers AND from clubs and libraries, and see how it goes. We'd like very much to be able to extend this initiative to future editions, too, obviously (new and improved editions just don't happen very often among these games, so...).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think other vipers will chime in ^__^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295859/#Comment_295859" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-04T15:25:39+00:00" title="October  4, 2010  3:25PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is such a clever idea.

A couple observations:<br><br>1. The Janus crew is very clever.<br>2. Italy is full of gaming clubs and has a meetup culture - it won't be hard to hand your old book to the publisher, in person, without a huge fuss.<br><br>For me, in the United States, this is a little more problematic. We are not clever and don't have a ton of events where people will be guaranteed to meet with publishers. We don't really have game clubs on a wide scale.<br><br>Doing this through retailers does not seem like a good fit - what is the retailer's incentive? How do they get compensated? Where does the old book go at that point?<br><br/>Doing this through the mail introduces costs and handling. American libraries don't want used materials. So I'd love to hear other ideas about how to reproduce this very excellent idea in our country.<br/><br/>Other countries will obviously differ - this seems like it might work in the UK, for example.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295899/#Comment_295899" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-05T06:13:48+00:00" title="October  5, 2010  6:13AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You konw, the weirdest thing is that from our point of view... the clubs and meetups are really pretty few and far between! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n<br/>\nBut huge thanks for the kind words ^__^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295950/#Comment_295950" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-05T11:51:31+00:00" title="October  5, 2010 11:51AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have so many books that I would happily donate if ...<br><br>a) I knew they would go to people who would use them / read them and pass them along<br/>b) it didn't cost me any money <br/><br/>optionally c) I got some, even small, recompense or trade for them                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/giullina" title="giullina"><img alt="giullina" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/458/nX18O567GCAJ6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/giullina">giullina</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295957/#Comment_295957" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-05T12:51:12+00:00" title="October  5, 2010 12:51PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello Adam, let me clarify:<br/>\nIn our Initiative, you can give us back your old version of the book if you want an upgrade.
