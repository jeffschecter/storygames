<p>Catching up on YouTube stuff from my hiatus from gaming, I was watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFbCxuvknWM" rel="nofollow">this roundtable</a> where three DMs were talking about why they hated the Inspiration rule in 5e and Mearls agreeing with them that it was made in such a way that it could easily be removed, that no other rule lean on it. (Other rules lean on having <em>advantage</em>, and inspiration gives advantage, which I think is elegant – it <em>is</em> integrated while not being strictly <em>necessary</em>.)</p><p>The case against inspiration were all centered around giving it out.</p><ol><li>You don’t need it because players RP anyway</li><li>It’s hard because you want to hand it out everytime any player opens their mouth</li><li>But some players don’t RP and they become resentful that they don’t get insp because it’s unfair</li></ol><p>My case in favor of inspiration is centered on using it.</p><p>The rule is that you spend your inspiration before you make the roll – unlike Fate, where you can spend fate points retroactively after you made the roll.</p><p>I prefer the 5e way (as I argued <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/438417/#Comment_438417" rel="nofollow">here, writing " I think the rolls get devalued and the tension deflated if you can just change it after the fact“</a>), it makes you have to be mindful of how much you care about a roll before you make it. It’s you having to be mindful of the bets you are placing. Generally I am in favor of placing the random elements at the end of resolving actions, situations, questions and conflicts rather than in the middle (which was the style for a while).</p><p>Listening to gaming tables you often hear “Oh, great roll! Good job!” but the truth is that dice are random. You don’t have power over them. Using insp is a way to get some of that power.</p><p>So to anyone thinking of ripping inspiration out of your game, that’s why I want you to reconsider.</p><p>Now, you can do what a friend of mine did, he gave every player inspiration at the start of every session just for showing up, and never any more, because of all of that. He was hip to all of the reasons Adam and the Matts had for removing insp, and all my reasons why I like <em>using</em> insp. It’s a good compromise.</p><p>But I’m also going to make a case, albeit weaker, in favor of handing it out during the session, to explain why I still do it.</p><p>I know I’ve said that I generally go to great lengths to deemphasize story. Story beats, story moods, the general Hamlet’s hit points thing. Focusing on the situation and the game world is what I’m here for. My role is <em>only</em> to set the stage. <strong>But:</strong> getting insp for when your character take emotional or social concessions and then translating that insp into successful action does tend to create interesting narrative. Quoting Fiasco, p50:</p><blockquote><p>Is it weird that you can wallow in failure the entire game, collect a ton of black dice from all those bad scenes, and then have a happy ending? I’d point to the source material – in the films Fiasco references, true sad sacks often come out smelling like a rose.</p></blockquote><p>You take your beatings in the beginning and then <a href="http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Luck_domain_deities" rel="nofollow">the gods of luck</a> smiles for you in the end. When I first read Hamlet’s Hit Points, I was like “this sucks, no way am I gonna go back to trying to curate scenes to that degree now that I’ve belatedly learned about player agency”. And then when I read Hillfolk I was like “Ooooooh! So <em>that</em> was the point of Hamlet’s Hit Points, <em>now</em> I get it.” You don’t curate scenes but having a token econ to affect how scenes are resolved automatically create a curve of downbeats followed by upbeats. (And, it’s only advantage, it’s not automatic success. You can still die in the end so the tension of D&amp;D is still there.) [That said, as I argued <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19763/d-d-5e-inspiration-compared-to-fate-core" rel="nofollow">here: “The economy was fragile. I sometimes would ponder solutions to this problem but nothing struck me as good.”</a> the economy in Fate and Diaspora would often grind to a halt. The way 5e works solves a lot of that, by:</p><ol><li>making inspiration that doesn’t stack, meaning there’s no nova and no glut</li><li>making many actions that in Fate costs points free, including fictional positioning. In Fate you spend fate points to invoke scene aspects, in 5e you get advantage for free for doing so. We want fictional positioning so it makes no sense in attaching a cost to it, it should be all reward.</li><li>Also refusing compels cost points in Fate, and is free in 5e. Also makes sense. The carrot is enough, no need for a stick.</li></ol><p>Anyway much love. Thanks for reading.</p> </div>

                            I do not award Inspiration in my games that often. I do award Advantage all the time, when characters help each other and when someone does something super cool or clever.<br/><br/>I award "Heroic Inspiration" to every player who posts a write-up of the last game. It lasts for one game session (the next one they play in). It works like <i>bardic inspiration</i> (a d6 they can add to a d20 roll, after the d20 hits the table but before final resolution is determined).                        </div>

                            My only problem with inspiration is that it's so loosely coupled to the game that we utterly forget about it.  <br/><br/>Well, that and "Good luck trying to remember everyone's background/flaw/etc, Mr. GM."                        </div>

                            I like Inspiration in principle, but it's awkwardly cobbled onto D&amp;D's chassis, and not very effective, in my experience. I've now played in three different D&amp;D5 games, and I've only seen a group remember to use Inspiration once (and it wasn't in the way it's described in the book). Two of the groups very explicitly liked the rules and wanted to use them (they told me so); they just couldn't manage to, in practice. That's not a good sign.<br/><br/>I agree with your notes about the mechanical implications of the rule, however - it's non-stackability and application is nice.                        </div>

                            I wouldn't say it's "awkwardly cobbled onto D&amp;D's chassis." I'd say it's loosely coupled to D&amp;D's chassis with great care and by design, so that it can be left off by people who don't like it. As a result, it's also not well integrated with (tightly coupled to) D&amp;D's other systems.                        </div>

                            Probably not (I'm not sure if the DMG recommends for GMs to occasionally award Inspiration, XP, or both for "good roleplaying" and "clever ideas", or not - so that may or may not be an issue).<br/><br/>The lack of clarity lies more at a structural level. What kinds of Character Traits are good for my campaign, and which will be irrelevant? Should I be pursuing opportunities to follow them, or just let it happen occasionally? Should the GM take Character Traits into account when prepping adventures? Does Inspiration represent anything in the fiction? Does awarding Inspiration for "good roleplaying" work against the purpose of the Traits? Etc. The purpose of the rules here is unclear to me.<br/><br/>My limited experience with other groups playing D&amp;D5 is that it wasn't clear to them, either. (For instance, the first group I joined raved about how much they loved the Inspiration rules when they invited me to join, but after four sessions I noticed that they never used them in play. In fact, after a year and a half of the campaign running, it turned out that I was the only player who had even written a Personality Trait, Bond, Flaw, etc, on my character sheet!)<br/><br/>It may be that it's all clearly explained in the DMG (which I haven't read), however. I'm just reporting on what I've seen "out in the wild" so far. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Yeah, the character traits part of the game, with the 1d6 tables to roll on (or choose, if you want) are <i>terrible</i>. Players ignore them most of the time. The Inspiration mechanic has neither legs nor teeth. <br/><br/>They'd have been better off with a rule that says, "Whenever you make a tough (and correct) decision regarding your Alignment, gain Inspiration."<br/><br/>(And I'd add, "And if a character takes an action that violates their Alignment, the DM can remove their Inspiration, if they have it.")                        </div>

                            If Sandra hadn't started this thread, I would have. I'm a huge fan of Inspiration, and it absolutely sings at my tables—including one I'm a player in, because I got the rest of the group bought into it. (It sings slightly less well there, but still 1,000% better than your median 5E game.)<br/><br/>But I also admit I houserule 5E rather heavily in my own games. My XP system is derived from Dungeon World, and you get XP every time you *spend* Inspiration. I also don't really worry about keeping track of who should get it when; I've handed the whole thing off to the players, and simply relied on them to have a sense of sportsmanship. If they didn't, I couldn't play with them anyway. Oh, but if someone does something Insp-worthy and already has it, the token "bounces off" of that person and they hand it to someone not currently Inspired. This takes of the less-confident-player problem. (This is only slightly off from RAW, which says that if you are Inspired, you can give it to another player.)<br/><br/>Still, even in my much less-houseruled Wednesday game of Tomb of Annihilation, in which I am a player, Insp works well. Because it turns out, the main hurdles to using it well are tactile.<br/><br/>-Everyone writes their BIFTs on a big index card / table tent thing, so everyone can see everyone else's BIFTs at all times.<br/><br/>-We have physical tokens for BIFTs. That part is ABSOLUTELY NOT OPTIONAL, and is *the* reason most groups fail at using Insp properly. It cannot simply be written down on the sheet; it has to be represented by physical tokens of some kind. In my Wednesday group, one player actually made hexagonal pieces of paper that say "Inspired" on one side, and, in a different color, "Not Inspired" on the other. It's a great design, because it's a subtle clue to pay more attention to the RP of whomever's not currently Inspired.<br/><br/>Now, in my own games—but not in the Wednesday game—we also do all the usual Story Games things of writing our BIFTs together at the beginning, so they're more relevant. Also, you get an XP for resolving and changing a BIFT, so that keeps things more dynamic over time.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the group I play in has always been fine with letting people spend Insp after rolls. While I used to be strict about requiring it beforehand, I've come to realize from that experience that was probably me being too much of a hardass for once, so I've changed that, and it hasn't really hurt things.<br/><br/>All that said, I will admit that "T" is definitely the red-headed stepchild of the BIFTs. You could probably ditch it for an additional B, I, or F and not hurt the game at all, and maybe improve it!                        </div>

This is me <i>giving</i> advice. This is me making a case to readers of S-G and to the participants in that roundtable that hey, inspiration can be an amazing mechanic that can pull a lot of weight.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" rel="nofollow">Adam_Dray</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I do award Advantage all the time, when characters help each other and when someone does something super cool or clever.</p></div></blockquote>
I wouldn't really use the word "award" there, they position themselves to have advantage so they have advantage.<br/><br/>Again, in my view of 5e as "improved Fate":<br/>in Fate you can spend FP to use the environment to your advantage,<br/>and you can get advantages (via FP) from concessions/compels you've accepted earlier, including calling on your own traits (I'm "The Fastest Gun in the West", or w/e).<br/><br/>In 5e the econ is refactored and simplified. Interacting w/ the environment is free, but there is still a way to turn your prior concessions/compels into advantage now. Insp is that way. And that is amazing.<br/><br/>As someone who have run Fate games where people forgot to use Fate Points all the time, the fact that 5e can sing even when someone forgets to use the most awesome mechanic of all time (inspiration) is a <i>good</i> thing. Advantage/disadvantage is used <i>all the time</i> (one of the best ways is via the wonderful "condition" system, i.e. aspects-with-codified-adjudication) even when Insp isn't.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" rel="nofollow">Adam_Dray</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>And I'd add, "And if a character takes an action that violates their Alignment, the DM can remove their Inspiration, if they have it."</p></div></blockquote>
Again, I'm happy that they removed the stick. D&amp;D can put characters in challenging situations and I love that it <i>rewards</i> flashlight-dropping without <i>punishing</i> you for refraining from it. In the Fate thread I linked to we went on a long tangent on how I've had some players who bought off every compel. And the FP econ ground to a halt.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" rel="nofollow">Adam_Dray</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>It has no relationship to XP at all, right?</p></div></blockquote>
Before Deliverator's (awesome) post my thinking had actually been that XP is sort of opposite to inspiration. XP = wordly power, Insp = emotional power. And when you take a loss, or give in to something, you gain Insp to compensate. <br/><br/>Matt:<br/><br/>NGL, I kinda still haven't gotten used to the word BIFTs. (I call them "traits" and I use the word TIBF to remember the order they're supposed to go on the sheet).<br/><br/>And tokens yes! Super necessary. And what I do is that I hand out physical tokens every time someone gets insp. If they have multiple physical tokens they lose them all when they invoke their insp, so it becomes ludologically isomorphic to binary "have it or not have it" RAW. (I have some other house rule where you want to spend one, two or three tokens but for the purposes of giving advantage/disadvantage, you lose 'em all.)<br/><br/>The reason I do the multiple tokens is that this would happen: if I don't give out insp to someone because they're already inspired, they lose the habit of playing to their traits or/and I lose the habit of giving out insp for them doing so. Having multiple tokens keeps the flow constant.                        </div>

                            Matt (Deliverator),<br/><br/>That sounds fabulous! I like how you've fixed most of the issues with Inspiration, made its use super clear, and drawn the whole thing together. Now it's clearly at the "heart" of the game's engine, and everyone is focused on it. Like Sandra's modifications, your little touches (like giving "excess" Inspiration to other players, which means it's still worth earning) build something really solid on top of the basic rule.

This is a large part of the problem, in my opinion. Putting the Personality Traits first and foremost (you start by choosing them, you choose TWO, and they're at the top of the sheet) really sends the wrong message.<br/><br/>Worse yet, every Background comes with tables of these to roll on or choose from. A few are quite nice, but many/most are absolutely terrible - not just the Personality Traits, but the others, too, like the Flaws and Bonds. I'll admit that I haven't gone through the book and read every single one, but when I made a character, I found most of the ones available to my Background entirely unapplicable to the way Inspiration works. If I was learning the game from the book, I would have come away with entirely the wrong idea for how to leverage the thing (and, quite justifiably, ignore the rules at the table - who wants to get a Bennie every time they describe their character twirling their moustache?).<br/><br/>On the other hand, if we pick our BIFTs carefully, openly, and/or author our own, there's a really good idea in there. For it to work, however, they have to be foremost in the DM's mind - if you prep material in accordance to the BIFTs, you can get some really juicy play out of them, I'm sure. I've yet to see someone do that (I think, because it's not part of the wider concept of "how to play D&amp;D" - for example, as far as I know, published adventures don't ever instruct the DM running them to adjust the content according to the PCs' BIFTs - and so overshadowed by other aspects of the rules and system, which take up all our time, attention, and focus), but I think it could work amazingly well as the springboard to a more story- and character-oriented D&amp;D campaign.                        </div>

Which is why I do it that way. I will occasionally give it to a player if I notice something no one else does, but I no longer feel any pressure related to awarding Inspiration.<br/><br/>Regarding the terribleness of the listed examples, well... I agree. On the other hand:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/5E PHB" rel="nofollow">5E PHB</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Four categories of characteristics are presented here: personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories, think about your character’s favorite words or phrases, tics and habitual gestures, vices and pet peeves, and whatever else you can imagine.<br/><br/>Each background presented later in this chapter includes suggested characteristics that you can use to spark your imagination. You’re not bound to those options, but they’re a good starting point.</p></div></blockquote>
So it's 100% RAW that the lists presented with the Backgrounds are just suggestions. Obviously, it'd be much better if 5E had explicit instructions to the group to write all the BIFTs together and such.<br/><br/>I have decided, after this thread and some conversations with friends, that next time I run 5E I'm going to tell everyone to choose only one Trait, and choose a second example of one of the other three, more dramatically motivating, characteristics.                        </div>

                            Just to reiterate I am a big fan of the RAW T T I B F.<br/>And picking up more bonds and flaws in play, or replacing some bonds and flaws.<br/><br/>In BW terms, the trait is similar to the instinct and the ideal is similar to the belief.<br/><br/>Again, I think there are just soo many analogies to Fate rather than any other game. And in Fate I like having some chill aspects that don't have to pull as much weight as the others. That also helps me as DM. I can think "OK I really want to be aware of Flaws this session" or "I want to involve Ashgar's Bond more". I can sort away the more harmless traits. And as we at the table, including me as DM, get more used to specific characters I can know when they are getting into trouble in a way that the character would but that they might not want to do otherwise (i.e. they are compelled).<br/><br/>My best tip for those who want to get the best out of 5e's adv/disadv system, both when using fictional positioning w/o insp and when using insp, is to read the multitude of Fate Core advice that has been written over the years. Read examples of Fate fights and think how would that translate into 5e.

The loading door is open, which means that there’s a large dock with water in it, so she also picks <i>Open to the Water</i> as a situation aspect, figuring that someone might try to knock someone in.</blockquote>
That is also awesome advice for 5e. Now, behind the screen, those aspects can be written up "<i>As Aspects</i>" with the camel case and the italics. That can really help you adjudicate and describe a scene w/o boxed text. (Unlike Fate, don't describe the scene <i>in terms of</i> aspects, instead, keep the aspect-ness of the aspects on your side of the screen or in your own mind.)<br/><br/><br/>The <i>Cramped</i> and the <i>Heavy Crates</i>? That's something to keep in mind that both sides can use to impose disadvantage or get the advantage.
<blockquote>On Lenny’s turn, he has Landon create an advantage by placing an aspect on Og called Hemmed In, hoping to corner him between some crates. That’s his action for the exchange.</blockquote>
In 5e, a lot of these aspects would be <a href="http://open5e.com/gameplay-mechanics/conditions.html" rel="nofollow">Conditions</a>, i.e. Langdon would make Og restrained rather than <i>Hemmed In</i>.<br/><br/>And read examples of Fate compels. I sometimes use insp in a way very similar to compels, i.e. hold it up to tempt a player to do something that would be true to my interpretation of their traits, ideals, bonds or flaws. And if they choose not to -- that's awesome too. I am so happy that they, unlike Fate, then don't have to pay for that.
<blockquote>Landon has I Owe Old Finn Everything and is returning to his home village after hearing it was sacked by barbarians, so it makes sense that, unfortunately, Old Finn was captured and taken far into the mountains with their war party. Damn his luck.</blockquote>
"I owe Old Finn everything" would be an awesome bond.<br/><br/>The fact that this system has been decoupled in 5e is a <i>good</i> thing. Similar to how you would want a software architecture to not be too tightly coupled or tangled. In 5e they various parts go well together, lean on each other, build on each other but can also be replaced and removed. It's a very houserulable, hackable system.<br/><br/>The character traits can inform you when you want to give advantage in a scene, they can help you when you prep and introduce NPCs, they can help you see when to hand out insp.<br/><br/>Insp can be a source of advantage, of sneak attack bonus dice, making a death save easier, or that desperate exhaustion roll in the deep desert.<br/><br/>Fictional positioning can be adjudicated as advantage, disadvantage, players can use it to their own detriment in order to fish for Insp tokens, and they can impose conditions.<br/><br/>Most of the conditions involve advantage or disadvantage or both.<br/><br/>But remove any of them (which I def wouldn't do) the system as a whole still stands. I think that's beautiful. Advantage/disadvantage is the glue that makes it all tick.<br/><br/><small>Also I love that advantage/disadvantage is pre-roll rather than post-roll. Really not into the elipsis trick:</small>
<blockquote><small>Lily says, “Okay, so I raise my sword up and...” (rolls dice, hates the result) “...and it looks like I’m going to miss at first, but it turns out to be a quick feint-and-slash, a classic move from the Infamous Girl with Sword” (spends the fate point).</small></blockquote>
<small>I get that it makes sense for super pulpy narration but to me it's a very stop-and-go, jerky, disruptive way of viewing the dice/cloud translation layer.</small> </div>

                            I'm not sure I agree with everything you said, but I really like that thorough overview of how and why it works for you, Sandra. Nicely put together! The examples from Fate are great (although I'm not at all sure what they have to do with Inspiration - wouldn't you do exactly the same thing in a game which didn't use the Inspiration rules?).<br/><br/>Two questions for you:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>The character traits can inform you when you want to give advantage in a scene [...]<br/><br/>Fictional positioning [...] players can use it to their own detriment in order to fish for Insp tokens<br/></p></div></blockquote>
These two things are things I'm not sure how to do.<br/><br/>Can you give an example of how a Character Trait might inform you when to give a character Advantage?<br/><br/>I've never seen someone do this in a game of D&amp;D. Is it, like, "Hey, you have a Bond with Alfalfa, so I'm going to give you Advantage to try to rescue him?"<br/><br/>And how can a player use fictional positioning to fish for Insp tokens? Or are you talking in a broader sense, here - where the player is aware that making a suboptimal decision (e.g. flashlight dropping) will reward them with Insp?<br/> </div>

                            Reading this thread, I think it's safe to conclude that the only people who have made inspiration actually work at the table are people who have modified it heavily in terms of how you get it and/or how it is tracked. <br/><br/>This is in line with my experience.  It is also in line with my opinion that Inspiration, as written, is garbage, because no one manages to get it working that way.                        </div>

                            I'm sorry my opinion is so upsetting;  It's just the vibe I got from this thread. Most of the people who have said "I love inspiration!" have followed up with "Here's how we made it work" and it contained a list house rules.<br/><br/>My personal experience with inspiration is we never remembered it or managed to get it to work until we implemented a bunch of house rules - much like the ones mentioned here, they were variants on the "use physical objects" and "Let players give out inspiration" mechanics.<br/><br/>This leads me to the conclusion that Inspiration AS REPRESENTED IN THE BOOK ("as written") is not very good, because everyone changes it.  A good mechanic doesn't require a bunch of people to tamper with it. <br/><br/>I'm not saying the CONCEPT of inspiration is bad, nor even every aspect of its implementation as written (non-stackability is pretty smart in context) nor am I trying to cast aspersions on anyone who likes it, but it's clear to me that lots of people struggle with it, and many of those who don't have diverged pretty far from 'rules as written'.  <br/><br/>Compare "HP" where the vast majority of people clearly have no problems using it as written.  Sure, you get some folks who make a physical tracker, or whatever, but it's obviously not the majority.  Inspiration seems to need this kind of physical help as a reminder.  Referencing your own thread on house rules, you've changed a good bit more than just "physical objects" vs "no physical objects".  And your list of rules isn't even comprehensive, since you also discard the standard/often suggested process of handing out inspiration for playing with BIFTs or whatever you want to call them.  Which only exists because the "rules" for giving out inspiration basically say "The GM can give out inspiration" and leave it at that.  So it's not really as simple as "You use physical objects".  You have a system, and it's not part of the rules as written.<br/><br/>I am not attacking you. I am not attacking your game. I am not attacking the way you use inspiration. I am not attacking liking inspiration.  I am pointing out that inspiration, as written, has issues that prevent a lot of people from using it effectively. Why is that not okay say that without you feeling "destroyed"?                        </div>

                            Stepping aside from the question of whether inspiration is well-implemented or poorly implemented as-written, which seems like a debate that could go in circles for days, I'm curious about what practical impact inspiration actually has. I'm curious about this because I don't have a very deep understanding of 5e, and I'd like to understand what I'm using inspiration to do before I start thinking about how I'm going to do it.<br/><br/>I apologize if I'm derailing by asking such a basic question, but at that zoomed-out conceptual level: what is inspiration for? That is, what is the inclusion of inspiration, as a mechanic, supposed to do to the game?                        </div>

This is me <i>giving</i> advice. This is me making a case to readers of S-G and to the participants in that roundtable that hey, inspiration can be an amazing mechanic that can pull a lot of weight.</div></blockquote>
Yeah, sorry - that soon became apparent, especially as I was reading a few threads in parallel.<br/>I'm loving these discussions about inspiration in 5E, especially all the cool ideas for tracking it physically at the table. Even as someone who has no plans of playing any edition of D&amp;D in the foreseeable future, I feel like I'm getting some mileage out of it.<br/>Plus - while the only forms of D&amp;D I'm ever remotely likely to gravitate toward again might be either some low-level B/X or BECMI based dungeon-crawling or heavily house-ruled 4E (perhaps made GM-less) - your various threads and comments have taught me how advantage &amp; disadvantage work in 5E, and made me appreciate it as a mighty fine subsystem which I'm totally going to appropriate for my own house rules or even new designs. Thx!                        </div>

                            My impression and experience, so far, has been that D&amp;D players either ignore Inspiration for the most part (in three games I played, it only ever came up once, and in a way that's not how it works in the text - as a substitute for XP after an encounter), or give it some serious thought, modify it extensively, and make into a more important part of the game (like Deliverator and 2097 seems to have done).<br/><br/>That said, this thread has really Inspired me (gah!) to consider it a little more seriously. I think they've really achieved their goals of making a mechanic which can inspire (gah, again - but it's really the right word!) people to focus their play in a more story-oriented direction, without the game hurting at all if the rules are ignored. A lot of D&amp;D5's design is like this: a bunch of tools loosely bound together, so you can (somewhat) choose which ones to use and which ones to ignore. I think that has contributed a lot to the game's popularity.<br/><br/>I've really enjoyed this discussion - there's been a lot of interesting food for thought!<br/><br/>Sandra, for me, at least, you've painted a much more flattering picture of Inspiration than I had before, and I'll be thinking about it for a while! I'd say that, if your goal was to make a strong case for Inspiration, then you've succeeded!                        </div>

<p>I was away and posting from a super primitive GSM connection (also had problems making uppercase letters) and I missed one of your posts in between mine, manixur:</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/manixur" rel="nofollow">manixur</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> Have you found inspiration to shift the focus of the game, or to have a significant impact on what happens fictionally, or has it been more peripheral?

I tried to answer it in my first point but maybe it got drowned out by all of my emotional ranting. Here’s what I wrote: “…it makes you have to be mindful of how much you care about a roll before you make it” That’s something I love about inspiration.</p><p>It’s also good at being an affordance mechanism that signal that following your traits/ideals/bonds/flaws is not only rewarded, but <em>allowed</em>. I know many roleplayers don’t need carrots. I know I, when I meet up with my old B/X group for a one-shot now and then, go just as wild and stolen-car-ish with my PCs that I do in games where I would get insp. But it’s not just a carrot. It’s a big sign that says that “this is <em>OK</em> to do, it’s <em>allowed</em>, you won’t get punished for doing it <em>or for not doing it</em>”. I love that. It is a chill and laidback mechanic (unlike me, I’m a nervous wreck as a human being♥).</p><p>It isn’t great at doing the HHP ups&amp;down thing. Because advantage is just one extra d20 so the reward of inspiration is actually a pretty puny compensation for putting your character into serious trouble. You might lose out on 200 xp for a meager insp. And that’s interesting to me, that’s an appealing tension to me. Like there are two separate, often conflicting scoreboards in the game: how often can you get insp vs how much xp can you get.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>The examples from Fate are great (although I’m not at all sure what they have to do with Inspiration - wouldn’t you do exactly the same thing in a game which didn’t use the Inspiration rules?).<br/></p></div></blockquote><p>The first two examples (with the crates and with the restrained condition) was meant to contrast the third (the “I owe Old Finn everything” one), which was a clear use of insp.

                            Good answers, Sandra!<br/><br/>Although I'm lost when you say the following:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>In 5e, you need to know exactly how they’re doing something (or exactly what they’re saying when they’re talking to an NPC) <em>because you have to know in order to even decide <strong>which rule to use</strong></em>.</p><p>To even find out which of these it’s time to use, you need to know more about the situation and the context and the time-scale you are in and things like that.

</div></blockquote>
Can you give an example of how the Inspiration mechanic might influence our choice of which rule to use? (And isn't Inspiration usually <i>all about</i> "intent" as opposed to execution?)<br/><br/>You've shown one strong example:<br/><br/>* When a player decides to willingly lose, quit, surrender, or flee and it can be tracked to a TIFB on their sheet, they know they stand to gain Inspiration from their decision.<br/><br/>That's a very important point! I can't really think of any other examples, though (and that one has nothing to do with the resolution mechanics of D&amp;D, as far as I can tell).<br/><br/>It also - it seems to me, please feel free to correct me on any of these points, if my guesses are wrong <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> - really depends on writing particular kinds of Traits. Most Personality Traits, Ideals, and Bonds won't often be applicable to "flashlight dropping", at least not the examples in the book.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Incidentally, most of my issues with Inspiration come down to one very simple problem:<br/><br/><b><i>They do not, as written (and in common practice, too) interface in any way with the GM's prep.</i></b><br/><br/>This means that writing them up is often meaningless, or a waste of time. It also means they rarely come up in play meaningfully. (In the last 7 sessions of D&amp;D5 I've played, across three different gaming groups, Inspiration did not come up even once. In the episodes of Critical Role I've watched - granted, only a handful - Inspiration has not come up once.)<br/><br/>I think that if the players are instructed to write BIFTs (or TIFBs!) in reaction to stuff the GM has prepped, they'll have a lot more "teeth". Similarly, if the GM preps material which builds on the BIFTs, they'll have teeth and come into play in interesting ways.<br/><br/>Neither of those happened at all in the D&amp;D games I've played of observed.<br/><br/>That's really the key here, in my opinion.<br/><br/> </div>

Huh, that's really interesting. This also explains why I haven't run into it much, I think -  it makes a subtle but significant change to a specific kind of play that I haven't been doing much of lately. Thanks for explaining!<br/><br/>Regarding the "no other rules lean on it" thing - do BIFTs lean on it? From this conversation, it sounds as if inspiration is the mechanical bridge between BIFTs and the advantage/disadvantage thing central to 5e.<br/><br/>(Also, can someone clarify exactly what BIFT stands for? Trait, bond...?)                        </div>

I think that if the players are instructed to write BIFTs (or TIFBs!) in reaction to stuff the GM has prepped, they’ll have a lot more “teeth”. Similarly, if the GM preps material which builds on the BIFTs, they’ll have teeth and come into play in interesting ways.<br/></div></blockquote><p>Mercer and Koebel seem to always involving NPCs from the player-created character backstories. (SWN doesn’t have “bonds” so in Koebel’s case during Swan Song he was doing it more informally, and I’m not familiar enough with Mercer’s methods – my point isn’t that <em>they</em> are looking at bonds to find these NPCs, but that lurkers of this thread can do that.)</p><p>Whoops I guess the word “teeth” is becoming polysemic in this thread.</p>

It would also be nice if it didn't conflict with other rules and mechanics*, of course, but now we're just better off choosing a different game.<br/><br/><br/><small>*: For instance, you're afraid of Shoggoths (your Flaw), and there's an encounter up ahead with Shoggoths. Being true to your character means you should run, but the XP system says "you don't advance as a character unless you fight these" (would you rather have Advantage on a single roll, or advance to level 2? ... the choice is obvious), and the encounter design rules say, "if you leave the others to fight on their own, you're letting down your team".<br/><br/>This works well if we're <i>intended</i> to ignore BIFTs in favour of, you know, playing the adventure (arguably the point of D&amp;D, so that's good), but is a terrible idea if you're interested in something more character-driven. Matt does a good job, above, of reworking the XP system so it's in line with BIFTs, above, as an example of how you might do that.</small> </div>

                            I can only conclude that the games you run are wildly different from any 5e D&amp;D game I've ever encountered;  I've played in several, with multiple different GMs, and none of them have ever managed to make inspiration work.  The GM just has too much to do to track all the stuff that's supposed to be involved in it and there's nothing to tie it to to remind us it exists, so everyone at the table ends up forgetting about it.<br/><br/>I don't think it stands particularly well as a teaching mechanic, unless the GM is really focusing on it.  Similarly, "The existance of the insp mechanic is part of what gives 5e resolution as a whole its teeth in the first place. It’s an affordance that it’s allowed to just fail. It’s OK to just take a loss. " seems like two completely separate ideas to me - the resolution mechanic does not need an "its okay to take a loss" mechanic to have "teeth" unless you are using that term in a way I am not familiar with - I am accustomed to it in the sense of "Has power" and considering that the resolution system already has the power to kill your character, I don't know that it needs any more teeth.  I in fact feel that the point of Inspiration is to take some of the teeth OUT of the resolution system, so it is at best confusing to me for you to assert that the whole system doesn't work without it, because that's contrary to every experience I've had.                        </div>

                            The whole system certainly doesn't work *for me* without at least some focus on Inspiration, but I agree, and Sandra seems to as well, that 5E does *function* without it.<br/><br/>Come to think of it, I'd say the way that *I've* given 5E's resolution mechanics teeth is by giving XP on a failure.

<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>Sometimes you go “Wait, you said character is a town merchant, uncomfortable with nature.

</div></blockquote>
That makes sense as a technique.<br/><br/>I must say that, as Airk outlines above (I agree with his post, broadly speaking), that's not a thing I've ever considered doing in D&amp;D or seen a D&amp;D GM do. I suppose it's fairly logical, especially to someone coming from a background of Fate compels, but, in practice, the GM never remembers all the PCs' Traits well enough to use it as resolution technique. I can see someone coming up with that idea, but I've never heard it articulated or used like this before - I don't think it's suggested by the rules text at all.<br/><br/>(It would also need to be player-initiated, I think, to be practical - e.g. four PCs times five Traits is 20 Insp triggers for one DM to keep track of... tough.)<br/><br/>Still, it sounds like a good tool! I'll keep it in my back pocket if I ever play 5e again. (Although the only game I can imagine wanting to rejoin doesn't really use Inspiration much at all, in my experience!)                        </div>

                            Airk, thanks for being chill and not escalating, much appreciated♥<br/><br/>By 'teeth', as discussed in that thread, I mean things that help you know when to do things in in terms of numbers/stats/dice vs when to do things by make-believing in the shared imagined space. Again, 'teeth' seems to have become polysemic in this thread.<br/><br/>Let me try to make this point in another way:<br/><br/>Compels in Fate teach people that it's OK to just fail without rolling. If you want to and if it makes sense for your character. To me that's interesting and valuable and it's been hard for some people I play with to grasp until we got 5e. In 'dice&amp;cloud'-terms, it helps us spend much more of our time in the 'cloud'. It's part of what makes us always have 'what does this situation mean for me?' in mind.<br/>That's the power.<br/><br/>In general, capable characters limited by voluntary subtractive mechanics is a big, powerful shift from low-capable characters using low-numbered ostensibly 'additive' mechanics as their interface with the world.<br/><br/>The additive model: My character's Persuasion score is how I interface with the world. It's the 'button' I want to push in order to get NPCs to do what I want. (Called additive b/c a high score could 'add', augment your character's abilities above your own. Obv a low score could be lower than your own abilities. If you're playing WFRP that's probably the case. Whiff-factor roleplaying.)<br/><br/>The subtractive model: To say it, say it. But if I deliberately give in or take a loss, in accordance with my character, I'll be rewarded.<br/><br/>I've found that engaging via the subtractive model has many benefits but most of them center around the dice/cloud relationship, making it more 'cloud'. And, what's awesome is that you have the choice to <i>not</i> give in.<br/><br/>Like, last session the only dice we rolled were for random encounters &amp; the rumor table. Social situations were handled by participants giving in voluntarily. Exploration situations were handled finchian style. And the one fight was avoided by use of a spell (a cantrip no less). This lack of rolling isn't necessarily awesome. The awesome part is that we don't automatically and mindlessly reach for the dice. We do that when an outcome is truly in doubt. And since the mechanics have given us  a culture of voluntary giving in, we less often have to actually go to Fortune to resolve. The "OK let's say I <i>do</i> fall down that tree" school of play. That's a pretty powerful mechanic.<br/><br/>Everway ahilh was a great predecessor in being a game that very early was explicit in giving guidelines for when to resolve randomly and when to use circumstances of situation combined with either the character's capabilities (Karma) or destiny (Drama). But it can sometimes chafe, 5e is better at putting more of that choice in the hands of the players, which I prefer. Karma = Finchian finding, Drama = Lawsian token shenanigans, Fortune = ability checks.<br/><br/>A lot of my thinking about this does come from that I ran Fate before running 5e. 5e has worked better for us. But every GMs/DMs journey is different.                        </div>

                            The 'keep track of 20 traits' thing: just learn to recognize 'giving in'. Learn to recognize flashlight dropping in its many forms. Over time get to know your characters and once you do, you can try suggesting compels.<br/>If you're weaving it into the traits into your prep, putting ghost aunts onto your roll tables etc, well, then you can make a note there about who to compel when auntie agatha comes a-knockin'.                        </div>

                            No worries; I apologize for my earlier choice of words - it's just that I've seen this mechanic fail at the table so many times that it's easy to be harsh with it.<br/><br/>I find your additive/subtractive model pretty apt, but I can't help but feel like the only reason the "subtractive" parts function here is because people want the bonus for their additive later because SO MUCH of D&amp;D is hardwired around the additive model still.<br/><br/>To put it another way: I feel like inspiration works for you not because you have house ruled inspiration, per se, but because you have houseruled a large part of the rest of the game.   I don't think the mechanics of D&amp;D 5E have given you a "culture of giving in".  I think you have developed that on your own.  Inspiration is like a <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFeather" rel="nofollow">magic feather</a> here. <br/><br/>Also, I find it very interesting that your view of inspiration seems almost entirely focused on voluntary failure -- I agree with Paul that this is something that is not even <i>suggested</i> by the rules, and something I've never even really seen anyone else discussing Inspiration consider as a way to use it.  <br/><br/>I think the disconnect here is that if I watched you play your game, I probably wouldn't even recognize it at as D&amp;D 5e.  This is not a bad thing -- I don't particularly LIKE D&amp;D 5e, and it seems like you've made a heapton of improvements, but I feel like representing the way things work in your game as the way things work in D&amp;D5e as written and as played by most people is not necessarily accurate.                        </div>

                            I agree with Airk, in that final paragraph. <br/><br/>Your game sounds like a lot of fun (as does Matt's), but, in both cases, the things which make it fun don't sound like D&amp;D5e to me, at all.<br/><br/>There's nothing wrong with that! Sometimes a given set of rules inspires us to do great things!<br/><br/>But I wouldn't, for instance, feel comfortable saying that "these are features of D&amp;D5!", in the sense that it <i>would be fair to expect them</i> when joining any old random group of people playing the game.<br/><br/>Still, this discussion has been really interesting, and educational, and thought-provoking, too. I have a good friend who's starting up a D&amp;D5 campaign soon and I'll forward it to him as an excellent resource.                        </div>

Thank you, though this seems counterintuitive to me.  I'd expect someone who'd been up to their eyeballs in 4e/PF to be all "Whoa! Inspiration so new and innovative!" whereas someone who'd been playing Fate all that time would, in my brain, be going "What, that's it?" <br/><br/>Maybe it's your background in other systems that is allowing you make something of Inspiration.  That would follow, but casts some doubt on the value of the inspiration rules (as opposed to the inspiration concept) if you need to have a strong grounding in other games that do this before you can make it work. (Incidentally, this is not really my experience either - I feel like I have a pretty good grounding in games with this sort of mechanism, and I just can't seem to engage with Inspiration without basically rewriting it to be more like one of the others.)                        </div>

                            Sandra,<br/><br/>I think the reason people find your comparison of Fate to 5E odd (or, at least, I do) is because those are (I agree) almost all potential problems with the Fate Point economy. D&amp;D doesn't have a Fate Point economy, so... of course it doesn't have those problems.<br/><br/>In other words, we could point to dozens of other games and also say that they 'fixed those problems'. It's just odd to compare two very, very different games and to say that one does the other one better. I think you just like D&amp;D's way of handling things better, and that's great! <br/><br/>On the other hand, I don't think many Fate players would completely ignore Aspects in play, the way most D&amp;D players seem to ignore the Inspiration rules, right? I don't see this so much as a case similar designs, with one being more elegant (or whatever), but just two entirely different games, one of which is more to your taste.<br/><br/>(I'm also not a huge Fate fan, but Aspects do about a million things Inspiration doesn't - e.g. Scene Aspects - so it would be just as easy to make an inverse version of your list, based on a player's preferences. For an easy example, "Post-roll changing the result, making you have to describe your actions w/ ellipsis trick" isn't to your taste because of the retcon required. However, a Fate fan would probably say that spending Inspiration on a roll and then failing anyway is a terrible design flaw in D&amp;D. And so forth.)<br/><br/>That's a really well put-together list, though, and interesting to consider. To the best of my knowledge, no one's ever compared Fate Aspects and D&amp;D Inspiration so formally before (again, I don't think that, to most people, they are entirely analogous). That's very cool! Kind of like turning a picture inside-out and seeing what it makes.<br/><br/>I think your comments on the presentation of the rules and the goals of "not angering the masses" are spot-on, also. I think it worked to maintain a happy fan base but annoys more serious game design fogies like us!                        </div>

I don't understand this part at all, though: you've lost me. Don't (or didn't) most traditional RPGs (including D&amp;D!) have modifiers for making "imagined space elements mechanically relevant"? <br/><br/>How is 5e's Advantage/Disadvantage any different from 3rd Edition's "if they are at an advantage, give them +2 to the roll/if they are at a disadvantage, give them -2 to the roll"?<br/><br/>I think it's more elegant, easier in terms of math, and it doesn't stack (which can be seen as a benefit or a negative, depending on your tastes), but it seems like exactly the same thing to me, otherwise.<br/><br/>And hundreds of RPGs have that kind of rule - probably most of them. <br/><br/>Help me out here!<br/><br/> </div>

                            Yeah, I think I see where you're coming from. <br/><br/>I think older games (like 3e; especially 3e, in fact!) certainly have "consistent adjudication of fictional positioning". They're just less elegant/more detailed (again, that can be a benefit or a drawback, depending on how much detail you like).<br/><br/>You're right that most "trad" games don't have "resources you can spend at will / that you get by playing your character according to freeform character aspects". However, that's been fairly common in game design since Fate, and probably before. I mean, <i>Fate</i>, <i>Burning Wheel</i>, and similar games have whole design traditions based on them.<br/><br/>You make an interesting point about how integrated advantage/disadvantage is in D&amp;D5; that's fairly unique, as a game which has both "consistent adjudication of fictional positioning" and narrative resource-spending (such games are fairly rare). There's a certain elegance to that.<br/><br/>But it comes with drawbacks, like anything else - for example, it's impossible for Inspiration to ever affect a sneak attack, so you can't make, like, an Inspired Sneak Attack - it's always one or the other. I think it's a worthwhile tradeoff, but I don't see anything particularly ground-breaking about that application.<br/><br/>Games like <i>TSoY</i> and <i>Sorcerer</i>, for instance, had fun negative feedback mechanics for bonus-spending, which accomplish the same thing but without the arbitrary limitations. I'm playing <i>Tales of Entropy</i> right now, which, like my game <i>Inconceivable</i> and <i>The Pool</i>, incentivizes you to try to win by the narrowest margin possible, which makes using "free form character aspects" a really interesting choice in other ways. <i>In a Wicked Age...</i>, especially with "Use it, lose it" rules, does a cool thing where you effectively get to choose how powerful you are in a conflict, but you're not very likely to end with its equivalent of "character resources" if you always pick high. <i>Lady Blackbird</i> combines Keys and Pool mechanics, so its equivalent of "inspiration" can be gambled and lost at varying levels, or even banked for character experience. Lots of designs do this kind of thing, as far as I can see.<br/><br/>My own games usually have something like this built into them. For example, my "Eowyn" game (and its generic version, "Burned at the Stake", which I know you've read) have a fun thing where fictional advantage gives you an extra die but resources you get for playing your character allow you to reroll a die (like D&amp;D's advantage, effectively, but stackable while retaining diminishing returns).<br/><br/>I guess I don't see such things as incredibly clever design, but as a kind of baseline for 'state of the art' game design - it's modern, it works, it's elegant.<br/><br/>Still, you make some interesting points about the integration of advantage/disadvantage and Inspiration. That's made me appreciate it a little more as a clever way to make a mechanic which can matter, if you want, but can also be safely ignored, all while staying carefully within the bounds of the game as written. That's well done! There are a lot of little slick things in the 5th Edition of D&amp;D which I appreciate. (I would probably play it more often if not for my various problems with it.)<br/><br/> </div>

                            I am with Paul; I don't think D&amp;D 5e is as revolutionary as you are painting it, and your examples just seem strange to me.  For example, "consistent adjudication of fictional positioning" is basically a ground floor feature of a functioning RPG -- a game that doesn't have that is a failure.  And as you point out, it's not really a difference between 5e and 3e.  Sure, 3e has different bonuses for different things, but it's not "inconsistent."  Indeed, some people might find it extremely frustrating that they are just as likely to hit a dazed, prone opponent as they are to hit one that is one or the other.  This is neither feature nor bug, it's just a design choice.<br/><br/>There are certainly also mechanical "chains" in 3e.  In fact, I suspect there are a lot more of them than there are in 5e.  They just don't chain back to "gotten by playing your character".<br/><br/>I dunno. I feel like giving Inspiration credit for the benefits of Advantage is thanking the cart for the efforts of the horse.                        </div>

                            I think the two of you don't see what I mean by 'consistent' in that phrase.<br/><br/>Like if 3e had that list plus one row "Anything else: +5" you would have a stronger case. That long, hard-to-remember list would still be detrimental (wtf where they thinking with that?) but you'd have a case for my point one. But that row isn't there.<br/><br/>Like in Fate if there's a rain of bananas? The rules <i>handle</i> that.<br/>This is where I see the strongest DNA strain from Fate to 5e.

                            Maybe I'm arguing a bit circular<br/><br/>1. 5e insp is good b/c does those three things (afford flashlight dropping, create ebb/flow econ w/o choke/flood, create agency w/ spending)<br/>2.

                            As the author, I can assure you that "Eowyn" was not in any way inspired by D&amp;D (I was entirely unfamiliar with Fifth Edition until 2017, and Eowyn's rules are all based on "earlier technology" as far as the economy goes). <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Like I said, I'm pretty sure I understand your point here - I don't think there's much more to be said, and your further elaborations just seem to be reinforcing the original points, as far as I can see - I just don't agree with it.<br/><br/>For the sake of a response, so you know where I'm coming from:<br/><br/>For example, sure, Inspiration attempts to afford flashlight dropping, create and ebb/flow economy, and create a sense of agency through spending... but, in my opinion, it doesn't do any of those things <i>well</i>. They are weak effects, easily ignored, easily overlooked, and largely unrelated to anything else in the game.<br/><br/>Just taking the first one, "flashlight dropping":<br/><br/>I've yet to see a D&amp;D player recognize Inspiration as something that can enable or even be used to afford flashlight dropping (it certainly didn't occur to me as a possible use of the mechanic, nor at least a few other readers here), its reward is far too small to outweigh the other economies present in the game, and it would require very specific TIBFs to be written up to work as such. (Looking at my last character, only one of the TIBFs could even remotely be used to justify flashlight dropping in any likely scenario, and even that one would be a stretch.)<br/><br/>In addition, we have the evidence (anecdotal though it may be) that very few D&amp;D players actually get any of those effects out of those rules, which is not a good sign by any metric.<br/><br/>But I appreciate the passionate advocacy for it here! Showing others how rules work in your favour at your table is really fruitful, I find, even if it's just to inspire people with good design ideas or new techniques for play. I appreciate the efforts you're making; I know that such discussions can feel disheartening when you don't win over your audience, but I want to emphasize that I've learned a lot from reading about your experiences with Inspiration, and there's a lot of good stuff to ponder as a result. If I ever run D&amp;D5 (unlikely for a variety of other problems I have with the game, of course), I'll be rereading it and picking out some of these great ideas. I bet this thread will be useful for other people, too; in fact, I've already forwarded it to a friend who's starting up a D&amp;D5 campaign! Thank you for starting it.                        </div>

                            Re-arguing points I've already brought up myself (advantage becoming zeitgeist after the playtest started, the weakness of the effect, the subtility of affordance mechanics, why even if it's not used it's a big deal didactically, other explanations why D&amp;D might be played in the same ord way) followed by "at least you're passionate" is a little frustrating (#emo2097) and I'm trying to read it charitably to not find it patronizing. I'm OK with the debate being over, of course. We'we been going in circles for a while.<br/><br/>You have a good point in how Otherkind is also a precedent.<br/><br/>But point of the OP wasn't to say "Hey you should ditch [game X] and start playing 5e instead" (well not in <i>this</i> thread at least). It was to advocate to WotC and to the D&amp;D luminaries at that round table that hey, <i>this</i> is what's inspiration is for. Please don't remove it.<br/><br/>Now Airk: adding some guidelines for unexpected things is great and one of the good things with 4e. But I've already addressed how advantage goes further than that. How the game teaches it to you via conditions, spells, abilities and how other things key off it. 5e eats its own adjudication food♥<br/><br/> </div>

                            Sorry, Sandra! I'm not trying to be patronizing. I think you've made a good case! I just don't see it the same way you do. However, this has definitely opened my eyes to some positive aspects of the Inspiration rules, which I had been totally not aware of before (at first glance, it seemed almost entirely useless, so hearing how someone is getting a lot of use out of the rules is a major point in their favour). I'll try to keep an open mind about it all, and maybe someday I'll actually see some D&amp;D in action with the Inspiration rules being leveraged fruitfully. I'd like that!                        </div>

Oh, it's absolutely the case for me that my background in other games is what enables me to function as a 5E GM. Hell, this was true back in 4E days, too; having run Mouse Guard is a big part of the reason I was able to make Skill Challenges—notorious as the absolutely most broken part of 4E, even after several revisions—work at all.<br/><br/>But there's a very subtle philosophical thing here between the actual "rules" and the "presentation of those rules." I'd love to see "2097th Edition D&amp;D" which doesn't really change the rules of 5E, but presents them in a different order, giving Inspiration and BIFTs their proper centrality.<br/><br/>I also wanted to mention that it is ultra-clear that the 5E designers didn't want to take strong stances on matters of underlying creative agenda or table social dynamics. This is entirely because of the much-overblown "4e backlash." The DMG has some cool tools in it, like the chase rules, but it is a fucking mess when it comes to play advice.

I just can't agree with any of your arguments on this topic.  I don't see anything in 5e that makes me feel like it teaches this stuff, and I don't really agree that the rules say what you say they do in a lot of cases.  My suspicion is that you are seeing logical connections that are obvious to you, but not to other people who haven't gone through all the processes you have, which is why Paul and I are sitting here scratching our heads and thinking "I don't think that means what you think it meants." We'll just have to agree to disagree on this one.<br/> </div>

                            I've mentioned this before, but I think it's worth pointing out on its own: by far the most significant "changes" I've made to how Inspiration works aren't really against the RAW, they're *just* formatting. Having everyone write their BIFTs on little table tents is certainly not forbidden by the rules of D&amp;D! Same thing with using physical tokens. Those two things alone do so much to just give BIFTs and Inspiration more mindshare.                        </div>

                            I think <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> brings up some interesting points on why inspiration works as an alternative to Fate points, and I will note that I have experienced several of the same issues come up in Fate games in which I've run. However, I have had little success in getting players invested in inspiration. I've tried increasing the bonus, allowing to be spent after the roll, and allowed it to be stored up for future use, yet my players ignore it for the most part (unless I offer them compels-by-another-name). I believe the issue stems from weak advice on how to make inspiration a part of the game, and there's no way to "earn" inspiration outside of the GM's whims.<br/><br/>If there were a list of ways to ensure that GMs hand out inspiration on the regular, I think that the system would have more success. These might include, but not be limited to, the aforementioned compels, automatic failing of dice rolls, choosing to suffer disadvantage on a dice roll, or suffering a "hard move" from the GM.<br/><br/>Or, to put it succinctly:

This is sortof what I was trying to drive at earlier.  The MOST IMPORTANT house rule that 2097 has is the one that systemizes/standardizes what sorts of things get you inspiration.  That's utterly missing from the rules as written except for some vague handwaving in the direction of BIFTs, which often fail because GMs have trouble tracking them.                        </div>

                            I'm not Adam, but his experience is almost exactly like mine - even when the GM said "Hey players, ping me if you see an Inspiration thing happening!" no one was remembering Inspiration.<br/><br/>I think it is different in Fate (Disclaimer: I've only played Fate Accelerated.  I'm still vague on why you'd want to combine Skills with Aspects ala Fate Core) in that Aspects are so central to everything that they are constantly on the brain.  Also, each player has ONE Aspect that they've sortof specifically tagged for this sort of thing - a Trouble Aspect - and while others CAN be used this way, you don't usually need to be on the watch for them.  So they are both central to the game in a way BIFTs are not, and there's actually fewer of them that really need to be actively tracked. <br/><br/>And on the flipside, somehow I feel much less shy saying "Hey, since my aspect is Billionaire Playboy Philanthropist, I'd like to get into trouble by hitting on the wrong person at this party." than I do saying "My flaw is "I have trouble trusting in my allies" so I'm going to turn and bolt." I suspect this is because D&amp;D remains, in my brain, a team based game overcoming obstacles, and just getting Inspiration for this still feels like it treads dangerously close to "I was just playing my character when I stole all your gold." I always winced at once upon a time.  Whereas in Fate, not only are the consequences are less (No one is gonna be out of the game because their character died because I decided now was the time to play a flaw) but this sort of thing is what the game is ABOUT - not getting levels and loot - so if I'm NOT calling this stuff out, I'm doing it wrong.  This part is all perceptual, mind you, but it's because I'm trying to play D&amp;D like D&amp;D and Fate like Fate as I perceive them.                         </div>

                            I feel like Inspiration management flies in the face of "the DM plays the world; the players play the characters." I am generally busy enough with world tasks. I forget about BIFTs.<br/><br/>I also think players forget about their own BIFTs a lot. Or at least playing to them.<br/><br/>When does level come up in play? Not in the middle of scenes. Generally only when you receive XP or use an ability that keys off it.<br/><br/>Alignment comes up in play, sure, but it's usually really natural to spot it. Everyone has alignment, and the number of alignments at the table is probably 3-4. It's pretty easy to remember "Neutral Good" or "the Rogue is chaotic neutral (asshole)."<br/><br/>Aspects come and go in play, and they can be a pain to manage, but lots of index cards on the table helps. Do you want 20 index cards on the table for 5 players?<br/><br/>When I run 13th Age, I have to track the following for each character: race, class, one unique thing, 1-2 backgrounds, 2-3 icon relationships. That, too, can be tough. However, I don't need to track each of those things <i>constantly</i>, waiting for it to come up. I need to remember these things <i>at some point in the game</i>, so that I can throw something at the character that references that choice. That is, there's no reward mechanic tied off these things. I put each thing I have to track on a separate index card, but shuffle the cards and treat them like a queue, looking at the top item and dealing with it, then sending it to the bottom of the pile.<br/><br/>With BIFTs, the DM is supposed to be watching for any sign of any one of those four things, for each player, at all times. That's a lot to track.                        </div>

                            People don't remember to involve inspiration, even if players are empowered to award it to each other, if the group doesn't craft their BIFTs together. But, I mean, we craft our flags together during session zero of every other game with flags... right? So that's also part of the "me &amp; 2097 (5e buddies 4eva!) method" that in no way goes against the rules of 5E, but is also just not culturally part of how people play D&amp;D generally.<br/><br/>Obviously wouldn't work for a drop-in game, I'll grant.                        </div>

I, or perhaps my Fate Core–worn eyes, understood the DMG p240-241 to that you should make up <em>a</em> rule for, but it’s utterly unsatisfying in giving you clear and good examples. I had been doing it the same way since the Starter Set (which came out half a year before the DMG) and didn’t change my style in that regard when the DMG came out.</p><p>This thread has given me reason to think to formalize it further, a la VSK’s interesting ideas:</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" rel="nofollow">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>compels-by-another-name […], automatic failing of dice rolls, choosing to suffer disadvantage on a dice roll, or suffering a “hard move” from the GM.</p></div></blockquote><p>I’d consider making the three latter into subsets of the former.

I tried the 16 thing (actually 20 b/c two T-traits), I tried having a sheet infront of me, I tried the table tents and like OK. Just like you: not into that.</p><p>Instead, the most important technique I’ve mentioned upthread is to teach yourself to recognize when people are giving in / taking a loss / being unstubborn (or overly stubbon) / doing risky, cowardly or otherwise unoptimal things. That’s a clue that they <em>might</em> be due some insp – often enough even then it’s obvious, if it’s not you can ask them. (“Was that one of your traits rn?”)</p><p>The second most useful technique is to weave the bond, or ideal or flaw, into the prep. Stick it onto ye random table. I haven’t done this a whole lot but this thread makes me want to do it more.</p><p>And then as you get to know your characters personalities you can learn more when to give them insp etc. I tried and tried and tried to do what Adam Koebel does in his BW campaign, where his players update their Beliefs, Instincts and Traits at the end of every session, but it’s been tough. Like this one player had this super amazing character concept [a theatre director/choreographer using necromancy to animate skeletons disguised as actors] that he played to the <em>hilt</em>, but he didn’t write it in the TIBF instead he just rolled some random stuff in there from the Entertainer background that he never looked at. I was like “wait… you never leave a corpse behind, that should be your trait, you’ll ge<br/>t so much more insp”. After a while I should’ve just started playing as if it was – that’s the hindsight lesson, learn your player characters as they actually <em>are</em> and try see whether or not players are taking losses in order to be true to them. But that PC died soon enough.</p><p>In other words, for the first couple of sessions don’t worry about the T-traits. Just try to develop an awareness of “whene are they just being pretty much themselves in the dungeon” (and I <em>like</em> that D&amp;D sometimes goes into that mode) vs “when are they ‘being Joanne’ instead of doing what they themselves would do”. If they are good at ‘being Joanne’ all the time, and that’s how it is with the group I have, I instead start looking for ‘being Joanne <em>to their detriment</em>’.</p><p>I’ve asked players to nominate each other or themselves for Insp, but they forget, too.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" rel="nofollow">Adam_Dray</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>In the end, I ditched it because it just wasn’t getting used that often.

Many people like to save their insp for the death save. Hence the growing pile of tokens as a cruel reminder that “oh, ok, I could’ve spent some of these.”</p><p>Also, Airk, with regards to house rules: I do have one house rule! I’ve allowed insp to be rolled on things like encounter checks and number-of-appearing as well. This is most def a change from the RAW. (That reminds me, I need to tell my new group that.) Not that it makes a big difference to meet 3d6 wolves [3d6 wolves have killed more parties than any other monster in my group] if you get 9 (average of lowest of 3d6 vs 3d6), 11 (average of 3d6 plain) or 12 (average of highest of 3d6 vs 3d6). But hey those two fewer wolves can be the difference between life or death. Or when you’ve become powerful, you might want more monsters b/c more xp.</p><p><small>Also for <em>some</em> campaigns I’ve tried a much bigger house rule: using insp as drama tokens that you can use to get people to give in etc etc. That has only been in play for a very small fraction of my games but I like it and will try to do it again.</small></p>

And how likely it is for "that PC died soon enough." to happen. <br/><br/>I think this is part of my problem with inspiration D&amp;D as well.  If death is legit on the table all the time, all this "be true to your character to your detriment" stuff can end up REALLY being to your detriment in a way that "But you got inspiration!" can't mend.<br/><br/>I feel like there is a legitimate clash between the way D&amp;D is/historically has been and the idea of roleplaying a flaw to your benefit in anything other than "Yeah, my flaw is that I spend all my money on ale and whores, so I do that when we get back to town." kind of way.                        </div>

                            Tying Inspiration to not only Advantage but also XP—specifically, gain XP when *spending* Advantage (something else I think you'd like, Sandra!)—has really helped with that.

                            Tying Inspiration to XP fixes almost all of my problems with it. (Consider, for instance, that your D&amp;D players will almost never forget to use Inspiration! You get to the end of the session and they go, "Hey, how much XP do we get?" Nope - next session the whole group is going to be trying to get Inspiration into action and play to their Traits, the GM will be prepping according to them, and so forth.)<br/><br/>Getting XP upon spending it reinforces that cycle even further. Now we're talking proper game design! A tight system which does what it's designed to do, with little room for failure and a very clear process for everyone to follow, buy into, and feed into their decisions when playing.<br/><br/>That brings D&amp;D5's <i>Inspiration</i> rules up-to-par with modern RPGs, in my book.<br/><br/>(That's a pretty DEEP hack, though, in my opinion, likely going so far as changing the supported Creative Agenda in play.)                        </div>

                            Agreed with Paul again.  An implementation like that would reverse my opinion on Inspiration (Well, assuming they cleaned up, if not the rules around awarding it, at least their explanation of the process around rewarding it).  It's a thing that integrates itself into the game instead of a weird little spinning flywheel off on the side that you need to remember to spin from time to time.                        </div>

                            The worst thing about 5e is that it's all things to all people. Like, so many of my house rules are from the DMG or better yet, me just refraining from using optional rules (like grid fighting or multiclassing).<br/><br/>The bad thing is that if someone plays 5e, I have no idea if there's gonna be a good match or not. If there's gonna be some mouse skulls involved. T_T<br/><br/>But the good part about it being all things to all people is that there are so many adventures and such great compatibility with OSR stuff. They really succeeded in the "modular" as far as I'm concerned.                        </div>

If that's the aim of this thread, it seems like there isn't much for the other forum members to say.  I don't see D&amp;D dropping inspiration any time soon.<br/><br/>However, this thread has branched out from this promotional purpose, so I'm going to jump in with a different experience that in no way refutes the good tweaks to formatting or drift in usage that folks mentioned above. (The "xp for spending inspiration" seems like a very viable hack).
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Airk" rel="nofollow">Airk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>To put it another way: I feel like inspiration works for you not because you have house ruled inspiration, per se, but because you have houseruled a large part of the rest of the game.   I don't think the mechanics of D&amp;D 5E have given you a "culture of giving in".  I think you have developed that on your own.  Inspiration is like a <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFeather" rel="nofollow">magic feather</a> here. </p></div></blockquote>
I have played 5E three times and I was thrilled to read the BIFTs rules.  During play, I found BIFTs and Inspiration deeply frustrating.  We played through tightly scripted modules and so BIFTs had no influence on events in game.  I received inspiration more frequently than some other players, but it felt like a reward for my (very amateur) acting skills rather than for providing depth to a character or building off the contributions of other players (which are closer to what I want to accomplish in "good roleplaying").  I have never heard of gaining Inspiration for choosing to fail.<br/><br/>I think the tweak I would make in a similar instance would be to introduce the themes and key NPCs of an adventure, and then do collaborative BIFTs that interweave with the core themes of the adventure.  (What is Curse of Strahd about?  What character beliefs would provide interesting points of friction around these themes without detracting from our effectiveness as a cohesive combat unit?).  We could then pull any one of the good Inspiration tweaks from above and get rolling.<br/><br/>In short, the impression I get from this thread is that there are styles of play worth promoting, for how they incorporate BIFTs and Inspiration.                        </div>

<p>The “BIFT” name sounds so dumb in Swedish… it’s like a meat smoothie T_T (biff saft)<br/>Also it’s a good way to remember the traits in the wrong order.

It’s -5 points (i.e. you get five character points at creation for taking it), but is it <em>really</em> worth as much as 5 in a dungeon or ice cold space where you never meet anyone? Is it really worth as <em>little</em> as 5 in a campaign where you have to be deceitful? Etc. Fate fixed that with an automatic balance idea: points are awarded post-hoc.

That that line is in 5E is sounds like a good framework for inspiration (if murky) but it doesn't say <i>when you choose to fail</i> (which is the thing I hadn't heard of).<br/><br/>I didn't read Curse of Strahd (I figured I wan't supposed to) so I didn't know it has BIFT suggestions.  Very cool.

The reason Burning Wheel gets "all the love" (from me at least) is that character beliefs drive play.  This is not just play culture tradition.  GM prep is explicitly and exclusively to challenge beliefs and bring them into tension.  I think 5E Inspiration plucked some bits from Burning Wheel's Artha rules, but it takes a huge amount of artistry to make them work in a different context.<br/><br/>There are reasonable critiques of BW's rewards systems (Your note that it emphasizes authorial skill is a strong one.  <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21921/end-of-session-rewards#latest" rel="nofollow">This thread dissects them. </a>), but the Artha system works because it is the beating heart of play.  You could not reasonably remove it (same for Mouse Guard or Torchbearer) without dramatically altering the game rules.

I disagree, because of the disparate importance of these systems to the two games, but I don't want to derail the thread with system-favoritism.                        </div>

                            We've definitely had the "why does Inspiration fail to work in 5E for most people, when the rules it's inspired by work so well?" debate before, so I'm sure Sandra is familiar with those arguments (perhaps even earlier in this very thread).<br/><br/>But, yeah, I agree fully with that. I think "BIFTs" going unused in D&amp;D is VERY much a design flaw - a case of incomplete design that wasn't well thought-through (by failing to integrate it with the rest of the game), much like the Plot Points rules which are also in there.<br/><br/>Still, I applaud peoples' attempts to make them work (even if it seems like too much work for very little reward to me - why not just port in Keys or Artha or something?); it's a worthy challenge.                        </div>

                            That’s definitely one part of the answer to your question in your previous post. There are lots of little dynamics like that in the design of games like BW which don’t function in D&amp;D because the Inspiration mechanic was simply slapped on top of an existing structure which doesn’t need it and doesn’t feed back into it. Equipment, on the other hand, is so fundamental to how the game works that, as you can see, it just all comes together, working as a part of “the beating heart of play”. As you point out, you saw Inspiration function in one of your other (?) campaigns because of the way you added social interaction rules which rely on Inspiration and this put it front and centre (but the parts which do that basically have nothing to do with D&amp;D).<br/><br/> </div>

Encumbrance is even an off-by-default variant rule (<abbr title='our beloved "Peachbee"; the Player'>PHB</abbr>. p 176). Most groups don’t use encumbrance. Most use equipment, but even that is optional as my <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20658/the-searcher-very-simple-5e-class/p1" rel="nofollow">“searcher” class</a> proves (which just uses 1d8+<abbr title="non-fighting ability">NFA</abbr> for damage for everything). We ran six campaigns before we started tracking inventory to this degree. All seven of our longer campaigns have used inspiration.</p><p>The fact that Inspiration has such a gentle touch on the structure of 5e, yet can have such an impact if given the right presentation &amp; a group that’s into it, is so elegant. They wanted (and succeeded) in making inspiration an optional rule.</p><p>Early on, this was after the PHB had <em>just</em> come out but before the <abbr title="monster manual">MM</abbr> had come out, I ran a one-shot at a con and it ended up being all about the insp, people were doing <em>everything</em> to get as much insp as they could as quickly as they could. In a way, I was both lucky to experience that game while also being unlucky to experience such an outlier since it made me kind of blind to the problems other groups (including my home group for a while) were having with inspiration.</p><p>(As an aside: DMs, if nothing else, if you use the little check box on the character sheet or whatever, if you don’t use tokens, or whatever, please keep this in mind: <strong>Never think “They already have inspiration so I shouldn’t give it to them”.</strong> Just give out inspiration if they earn it. The way I do it is that I use tokens but when you spend it, you use all of it. That is also a motivator to see “Oh, I could’ve used it two times if I had used it more often”. (I later came up with other uses for one, two or three tokens too. Not sure that was the best idea!))</p><p>Other optional rules haven’t been as successful; the 5e <abbr title="dungeon master guide">DMG</abbr> introduced a system where you could play with miniatures on a map and I asked around and people who were doing minis were like “It sucks compared to 4e, people are standing still so much more and just wailing on each other it’s kinda pointless <abbr title="to be honest">tbh</abbr>”, because of the lessened reliance on cartesian space of 5e’s mechanics. In 4e everything is all <code>shift</code> this, <code>close burst</code> that, in 5e the mechanics are about other things. It heavily leverages whether or not you next to someone else, but that’s it. Not saying no-one uses minis, obv a lot of people do, including Critical Role, but that that part of the game wasn’t as successful as a “module”.</p><p>So the “miniatures &amp; map” module didn’t touch on every part of the rules. Almost no ability, like for example the ranger’s “Colossus Slayer” (deal an extra 1d8 damage to a creature if it had already taken damage), actually <em>care</em> that you are 28<abbr title="millimeters. 28 millimeters is a little over one inch">mm</abbr> tall. The Colossus Slayer doesn’t depend on <em>where you are</em> to work. So the “miniatures&amp;map” was a flop as a module. <small>(Which, since I don’t want to use minis, is great. I personally love that that module was so loosely coupled. I feel for those who didn’t appreciate that, though.)</small></p><p>What if inspiration was tied to almost every class ability? What if the “Colossus Slayer” special power used it, what if the Rogue’s “Expertise” power used it, what if the Wizard’s “Ray of Frost” used it, what if death saves and wilderness navigation used it? Well… <strong>it is</strong>. All of those powers, and almost <em>every</em> power, benefit from inspiration, and it adds more agency and deliberation to using those powers. “Is <em>now</em> the best time for me to exert his extra effort? To spend my inspiration? What if I need it more, soon?”</p>

True, but since inspiration also touch on every other rule, maybe it, too, just needs the right "inventory sheet" equivalent. I won't get a chance to playtest my new presentation until this Saturday and it's likely it'll need a couple of more iterations to get good. The "inventory sheet" needed five iterations, the version with the chains was the nadir and that one stuck around way too long.<br/> </div>

                            The difference is that all those things feed back into the inventory rules. (When I pick up that golden statuette, I have to choose whether to drop my weapon or my torch - that’s interesting!) Nothing at all feeds back into Inspiration.                         </div>

                            Or does it ? It's earned and spent. You can chose to spend it or not, in a roll / resolution. More important, you can chose to earn it or not, and that's in the background all the time for decisions regarding "the goal". <br/>I understand there is no strict focused mechanic shooting pellets into the Inspiration funnel.

Which, as Sandra points out, is why making Insp part of the XP mechanics is so important.<br/><br/>Though the XP is not critical in my version of 5E! By far the biggest source of XP is failed rolls.                        </div>

                            Sure, technically you could. In practice, Inspiration is probably... 10-20% of XP gain? Not trivial, and it certainly flows back and forth in the way that you and I both like. But TBQH I think the physical reminder with tokens, and the table tents with the BIFTs on them, is as much a thing as the XP.                        </div>

                            I believe I actually questioned that balance over in the other thread (or was it here, earlier? can't remember). Wouldn't it serve the game better if more of the XP balance was based on Inspiration? 10-20% is something, but a fairly minor impact (probably not enough to hold someone or the group back a level, for instance).                        </div>

Possibly! But remember, you're also getting a powerful mechanical benefit every time you spend Inspiration.                        </div>

                            Ah, yes. Good point!<br/><br/>(I just love the unignorableness of XP awards, you know? You go without Inspiration for a session... not a big deal. But people stop leveling up and they're <i>gonna do something about it</i>.)                        </div>

                            Otoh I kinda like that they can choose to not go for insp and not use insp. It's a strength of the game that it's not like Microscope that always put you on the spot to be creative<br/><br/>But otgh the games where insp does matter are often awesome<br/><br/>On the fourth hand, my fave kind of D&amp;D is the players trying to deal with item, location, obstacle, person, creature, or trap through talking about it as if they were talking about something that actually existed.                        </div>
