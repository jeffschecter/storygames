The criteria were to write an espionage game in an interesting time period prior to 1914. So I wrote <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/post.php?CategoryID=16" rel="nofollow">Okhrana</a>, about political emigres trying to dodge the Czarist secret police in belle epoque Paris (1899, to be precise). the game is rough, is scrappy, but the core, I think is there. However...<br/><br/>The bit that is troubling me the most is the rewards in it. At the moment, each scene defines what the protagonist gets for winning or losing. Fair enough. But it doesn't seem satisfactory at all. I'm thinking of changing it to allow the player to 'bet' how much he/she would like their protagonist to gain/lose as the result of the conflcit contained within the scene. I was thinking of a range from 1 - 3. If the protagonist succeeds, the positive attribute they were using goes up by the amount selected. However, if they fail, then the negative attribute that was opping them goes up by the amount selected.<br/><br/>(Protagonists have two pairs of attributes: Guile and Stupidity, Fervour and Doubt. The protagonist use the positive attributes, the antagonist uses the negative attributes. The game text contained in the PDF linked to above is actually pretty brief and gives and idea of how things work).<br/><br/>Any feedback and advice would be grand.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64525/#Comment_64525" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-20T07:21:57+00:00" title="April 20, 2007  7:21AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Malcolm,<br/><br/><span style="color: red;">I'm thinking of changing it to allow the player to 'bet' how much he/she would like their protagonist to gain/lose as the result of the conflcit contained within the scene.</span><br/><br/>Dangerous. See <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=689.0" rel="nofollow">no islands in the pool</a>.

That's a very instructive and interesting thread there, one which I think I will be reading at least another couple of times to make sure I'm taking it all on board. Your very first post in that thread actually provided a lot of insight for me in terms peoples reactions to such a mechanic.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
