Here's how it will work:<br/><br/>1.  You have until Monday, 9 February at 0800 EST to write up a situation.<br/>2.  A situation in this case is the intersection of two or more people or groups, tied to two or more locations or objects, at a point of explosive tension due to incompatible goals, beliefs, or obsessions.  It cannot exceed 400 words.  <br/>3.  Give your submission a short title.<br/>4.  You must include at least two people, groups, objects, or locations <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/henford/henford_1.0.pdf" rel="nofollow">already authored</a>, as well as something new.  If your original location description got edited down, feel free to re-introduce stuff you originally contributed.<br/>5.  The original rules apply.  No magic or monsters, one entry per person, name list, build on what's been created.<br/><br/>After the deadline I'll set up a survey and we'll vote on the best ones to include, so this is a little competition.  Show us your best work. As with the locations, winning submissions will go in the final thing, which will be CC-Attribution.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190824/#Comment_190824" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-02T06:17:34+00:00" title="February  2, 2009  6:17AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2009 6:23AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The Slave Auction</b><br/><br/>The Shining Host has returned, as it does every summer.  This year Captain Cassamorno has brought eight slaves with him, matched pairs of sickly young men and women, their skin the color of teak, their hair straight and black.  <br/><br/>Slavery isn\u2019t unknown in Henford \u2013 serfdom is a fact of life in the Royal Banns beyond the gates, so the concept isn\u2019t truly alien  \u2013 but it is a grey area in the law under the People\u2019s Reformation within.  And, at least officially, there are no slaves in the city proper.  Arcus Baston\u2019s arrangements with the Captain are not common knowledge, nor are his purchases.  Or his appetites.<br/><br/>But Cassamorno has eight slaves to sell, and sell them he will.  The Apernathian\u2019s have taken the slaves in until the date of the sale, housing them in a stable within the cloister  attached to St. Frishop\u2019s Cathedral.  The Brotherhood is in the process of teaching them just enough of the local tongue to convert them before their imminent public auction in Glonton Market.<br/><br/>The Captain gave them names of convenience:  Primo, Secondo, Terzo, and Quarto for the men; Quinta, Sesta, Settima, and Ottava for the women.  Their real names are W\xe9waam, Utpijan, Nuntin, \xc9kunyn, Irqna, Ahta, Wanta, and Kijpijana.  They passed through many hands before being sold to Cassamorno.  They are confused and ill and have been subjected to unspeakable cruelty.  One of the women, Ahta, is pregnant.  <br/><br/>Sensing a profitable event, the Merchant\u2019s Camp lobbied to host the sale, but the Captain turned them down cold.  He wants to establish and expand a profitable trade in slaves, of which this is the first timid  salvo, and to do that he\u2019ll need the backing of the Duke-Elect.  The Council of Six, in retaliation, passed an edict declaring slavery an affront to God and nature, and announced that anyone \u201cchained in vile durance\u201d who set foot in the Merchant\u2019s Camp would be instantly and forever free.  A small-print exception was granted to \u201cforeign embassies\u201d, such as their neighbor the Sultan.  <br/><br/>There are those in Henford who find the selling and keeping of slaves repulsive.  There are those who would bloody Cassamorno\u2019s nose.  And there are those who would see the Duke-Elect and his evil son knocked down a peg.  Eight poor strangers are the unwitting fulcrum for all these desires - and they have their own plans, as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tobiasopdenbrouw" title="tobiasopdenbrouw"><img alt="tobiasopdenbrouw" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tobiasopdenbrouw">tobiasopdenbrouw</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190962/#Comment_190962" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-03T01:54:30+00:00" title="February  3, 2009  1:54AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 3, 2009 1:57AM by tobiasopdenbrouw.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Yorsa's end (?)</b><br/>From the Sultan's balcony, backlit in blue from the dome\u2019s crystal, Yorsa is looking across Henford, easily looking over the walls. The light glints grey-blue from his slightly unfocused eyes as he pets the dog that will make him, and his master, undisputed champions. His mind\u2019s eye is upon the Rat Pit, and the walk that will take him there \u2013and back, hopefully. The dog\u2019s eyes are light blue too, and there ends all its cheer.<br/><br/>The sultan\u2019s vizier read his fortune this morning. All the bloody signs came up.<br/><br/>His  informant from the Palanquin couldn\u2019t tell him too much, but some, he knows. They\u2019ll try to put their razors on him at the Merchant Camp, in the crowds and business surrounding the slave auction, or on Gurge Lane. He obviously cannot take the Sultan\u2019s eunuch guards. The newly imported hard men from Sailor\u2019s Corners and their bought loyalty will have to be enough.<br/><br/>And if they are indeed enough, Yorsa has his own targets.

Frenkle\u2019s began to flourish under Prit watchful, albeit somewhat dictatorial, eye.  Prit and Kale met frequently to discuss business matters, often late into the evenings.  The partners\u2019 business meetings soon took on a more personal air when Prit tested a new love potion on an unsuspecting Kale.  The results were more than the Mother Surgeon expected.  Kale\u2019s passion was unquenchable and the seducer became the seduced.  Thus began their secret, tumultuous affair.  Prit, usually the aggressor in love making,  was completely overwhelmed by Kale\u2019s domination in bed.  Months later and Prit was pregnant with Kale\u2019s child.  Soon Vercy was born.  Kale immediately knew that Vercy was his though Prit denied it to everyone insisting that her husband, Moce, was Vercy\u2019s father.  As Hymerset\u2019s was a matriarchal business and having not been able to produce a female heir, Prit was at once ecstatic and grieved by the birth of Vercy.  Here was her chance to keep the business in the family and not break the line.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIgnored and unnoticed by either of them were Moce and Kale\u2019s wife, Elza.  At first drawn together to commiserate they began their own tryst. They were truly happy with each other and their love produced a son whom they named Amot.  Oblivious to his wife\u2019s indiscretion, Kale accepted Amot as his own and raised him to be his heir.  Elza\u2019s guilt grew as Amot did and she tearfully broke things off with Moce.  Years later on her death bed she confessed to Bishop Bramon.  He and Moce are the only ones who know Amot\u2019s true lineage.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, being an astute business man himself, Kale recognized a chance to move up the social and financial ladder.  He began to blackmail Prit for better clients and a bigger stake in Frenkle\u2019s.  Prit complied with Kale, biding her time.  Kale found that social status and wealth suited him well and he continued to put the screws (in more ways than one) to Prit.  He desired to be rid of treating riff-raff and his lust for more power emboldened him.  One night he confronted Prit in her laboratory beneath Hollas Garden.  The partnership was to be switched.  He was to be the controlling partner in both establishments!  Or else her lovely Vercy and darling Moce would know the truth and the Hymerset line would fall because of her.  Prit had had enough of this and attacked Kale with her dagger.  Though she was an athletic woman, Kale was larger and stronger.  He overcame her and slew her with her own weapon.  He dragged her body deep into the catacombs and buried her there.  He then slipped out of the catacombs through the secret jail entrance beneath Archam\u2019s Peak.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDays later Kale began to act strangely.  He would beat customers at the slightest provocation.  He began talking to the air as if someone were standing there.  He didn\u2019t shave nor bathe.  He took to wearing a nightshirt everywhere. Whatever had taken over him was progressing.  What had taken over him was Prit\u2019s revenge.  It seems that her dagger was poisoned with a slow acting concoction that rendered the victim insane.  He continued to decline.  Kale spend his last days cared for by monks in the sanitarium of St. Wester just outside of Henford.  <br/>\nFortunately for Frenkle\u2019s Kale\u2019s son Amot is a cracking business man and the business turned back from the brink of ruin.  Gone though were the days of hopknobbing with the aristocracy.  Kale\u2019s removing of Bishop Bramon\u2019s ear during one of his fits saw to that.  Amot longs for his former life and knows in his heart that somehow the Hymersets were responsible for his father\u2019s insanity.  He yearns to avenge his father and reclaim their former glory (such as it were).  To this end he arranged for his daughter Isabert to be apprenticed to Vercy.  Vercy had become Mother Surgeon upon Prit\u2019s mysterious disappearance.  Vercy has a keen business sense and is a kind woman.  She happily agreed to take on Isabert who is the same age as her own daughter Cottie.  Isabert has joined Cottie who is training to take over from her as Mother Surgeon.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAmot is pushing Isabert to spy on the Hymersets.  But she and Cottie have become fast friends.  Will she betray her best friend and help her father?  And what of Kale\u2019s ravings that Vercy is his daughter?  Will Bishop Bramon keep silent or use his knowledge to destroy both families?  What of Prit\u2019s strange disappearance?  Will her grave give up its secret?  What of Moce?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192202/#Comment_192202" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-12T04:46:24+00:00" title="February 12, 2009  4:46AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For whatever reason this failed.

None recall their names, but some few do recall their presence, and the legend of their treasure...<br/><br/>Blance Hollas was one such, and as a friend of Arcus Baston, he felt that he could pursue the legend without fear of reprisal.  What peasant would challenge a bravo such as he?  When the cowled figure appeared from the mist behind him and he saw the gleaming sword, Blance realized, too late, that he was wrong.</i><br/><br/>It was in the holly grove atop Fallow Mound that a local farmer discovered the corpse.  Headless, handless, and dressed all in dark velvet, it was found lying near a shallow pit dug into the side of the Mound.  A lantern and a shovel lay near the body, and there were other shallow pits nearby.  The corpse's sword was still sheathed.<br/><br/>Sheriff Robel, investigating, noted that the body was unmarked, apart from the missing bits.  Had the man been forced to dig his own grave?  Or had he been digging for something else?  The farmers claimed to have seen 'witch lights' up on the Mound during the past nights, and had wisely stayed away.<br/><br/>The widow Ducell, claimed to have seen no such lights, but said to the Sheriff "Them as has no respect for the dead shall get no respect when they joins 'em."  Then she spat on the corpse.<br/><br/>No farmer had killed this man, the Sheriff was sure -- this was the work of a professional, a swordsman of unparalleled speed.  But what motive could such a slayer have, to kill a man out here?  <br/>Sheriff Robel knew that this would be another unsolved crime -- and so long as friends or family of the victim did not put in an appearance, he could be content to leave it so...  <br/><br/><i>Aleand Bastaff, Playwright-in-Residence at the Palanquin, nodded once as the widow Ducell passed him the small pouch.  The silver it contained was enough to pay for the task accomplished, and Bastaff had no interest in asking how she had obtained it, or why she had purchased his particular skills.  The money itself was sufficient.  After all; The Whimsy Guild, like any artist, works on commission.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192570/#Comment_192570" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-14T09:30:14+00:00" title="February 14, 2009  9:30AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 14, 2009 9:37AM by JuddG.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i><b>For  Few Berries More...</b></i><br/><br/>Bridgebee Crossing [C] is throwing one of its famous block parties again and the ladies of the households are already scheming to outdo each other.  Andra Kulsun has a scheme to beat the band.  Maybe she knows you from her herb shop in Glonton Market [M], or maybe from the neighborhood, but she has a task for you.  She's making fruit pies for a pie-eating contest \u2013 with fruit that comes from just one place.  One well-guarded place.<br/><br/>Lover's Tree [V] bears strange fruits not seen elsewhere in the region (no one knows what land the seedling it was grown from comes from). These Berra fruits (green fruit within a hard gray shell) are a delicacy that is associated with love and serves as the center of candies traditionally given to lovers on the Feast of St. Frishop.  They would make sinfully great pies, but the guard posted there guards the tree and its fruit.<br/><br/>The guard on duty tonight is Tulag Gracem, an honest cop to be sure, but a heist is a heist \u2013 and a promise a promise.  He will not be willing to let the fruits go, and you may not be alone in wanting a few of them.  More razors than yours may lay in the bushes.  Andra was clear the pies aren't worth a man's blood, but she didn't come along, so you kept your options open.<br/><br/>Maybe you get there and do the deed and a farce unfolds in one of those legendary funny moments every dark-blooded town has.  Maybe you scheme Tulag and get the fruit only to find him winning the pie-eating contest himself.  Maybe, you get there and Tulag is hung from the tree and you can hear Law Crawlers stalking the woods to finish the frame-up.  Maybe the tree is barren and Tulag wakes up from a head blow to see you not the honest thieves.<br/><br/>Lots of maybes tonight and only one way to know what happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
