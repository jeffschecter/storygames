Could experience levels in a RPG be used to effectively create a "narrative evolution" of the characters' involvements in a story?<br/><br/>In many TV, comic, and serial novel series, it can be pretty common for a character to seemingly invent a new power, trait, or historical motive on the fly, without any prior mention of this aspect ever occurring in the context of the medium.  Comic book heroes might manifest a new power that they had all along but never had a reason to use, for example.  Just about everything that happens in the show <i>Lost</i> is another good example.<br/><br/>I would hazard a guess that the large majority of tabletop games out there are played with the focus upon a group of lowbies who progress to greatness, developing new abilities and advancing old ones as they progress.  But there are other takes on this idea out there, that instead focus on a group of characters with a myriad of backgrounds great and small, allowing starting characters to be established warriors, rulers of men, accomplished tradesmen, famous rock stars and more.  In games using experience levels, it is typically assumed that such characters are of higher levels, having accomplished much and learned great things in their careers.<br/><br/>But what about instead representing them as low-level characters?  These characters would be crafted the same as any other character, but special attention would be taken to foster a mindset that not all of the character's future abilities are learned and acquired as the game porgresses, but instead they are there but simply manifest when the time is right.  You could play the Greatest Wizard in the Land as a lowly first-level caster, who only casts the low-level spells because the biggers ones just aren't appropriate now.  The Great General Morbecase is a great leader of warriors, but only functions as a first-level armsman because that's what is appropriate for the current developing narrative.<br/><br/>I think this playstyle could be quite workable, but requires a major shift in perspective on behalf of all involved.  When new levels are acquired, instead of the typical "learn a new ability" approach, the new powers and traits could manifest on the spot with some bit of a Flashback introduction, to the character learning the power long long ago from a great master.  Or perhaps instead a "I haven't done this in ages, let's see if I still have the knack" perspective.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73612/#Comment_73612" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-04T12:51:53+00:00" title="June  4, 2007 12:51PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thats the way I have gone with my system for <b>MI:666</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThe GM sets a minimum and maximum number of 'destiny' points that each player can have. So the game might be a 3-10 game. Minimum 3, max 10.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt Char Gen, the players spend these Destiny points to build their characters. Yes, you could choose to spend 10 but that would mean your characters story was 'finished' and they wouldn't have any real impact on the ongoing story. In test most players have chosen 4-6 from that range.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring play, when the PLAYER thinks it is appropriate they can spend a Destiny point and reveal a new skill/power/connection/relationship - whatever. The GM then has to adapt to that new facet of the character that has been revealed.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously, theres more to it than that! However it has worked in test and it has got a lot of positive feedback from the testers. Because the DPs are a finite resource, they are not something to fritter away thoughtlessly. They only come into play when you really need to do something impactful to the storyline. It also passes my 'Star Wars' test, in that I can model Star Wars on it - Luke starts out as a 3DP character, spends one when he talks with Obi-Wan ('Your father is a powerful Jedi') and one in the cockpit of the X-Wing ('Use the Force, Luke!') etc. One when he trains with Yoda, one when he has his heritage revealed by Vader (Leia's player spends one then too...) etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe downside is that yes, it does require the players to be 'on board' with the concept of the game building the characters through dramatic revelation. Someone who couldn't give a flying fook will just burn their 10 DP at the start and be left with a mannequin (and a search for a new gaming group. Tough love, folks, tough love!)<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73613/#Comment_73613" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-04T12:58:28+00:00" title="June  4, 2007 12:58PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why does a character become a "mannikin" after his last DP is spent?

So a "Ninja Master" trait might be a whopping 10 if the game is all about ninja masters, or just 2 if the game is all about teen romance, and one of the teens happens to be a ninja master.  Additional traits can be added to the sheet, not because they are learned or had been blocked or were not appropriate to use, but because now they are significant and beforehand they were not.<br><br>Uncle Iroh's ability to redirect lightning being a prime example.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phasmaphobic" title="phasmaphobic"><img alt="phasmaphobic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stuff.realitymerchants.com/pics/drg01.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phasmaphobic">phasmaphobic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73640/#Comment_73640" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-04T14:20:18+00:00" title="June  4, 2007  2:20PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that idea.

It wouldn't change the <em>mechanics</em>, sure.  But it would certainly change the <em>system</em> (the means by which the players agree what happens at the table).  Characters with rich histories function <em>fundamentally differently</em> than characters designed to accrete rich histories.  If you have all this history behind you and you want it to be relevant to the development of the fiction, the GM either has to pre-weave your history into the prepwork or has to constantly field questions on an improv basis about how the PC's history interacts with the prepwork.  That is very, very different than starting the game off with "the farmboy," "the tomboy," and "the baby mage" and developing the rich history there, at the table, as a shared foundation from which to create new situations and play experiences.<br><br>There is something to the school of play that rejects pre-prepared character histories; you get a very different play experience from that set up, and it can be positively thrilling.  That we-did-this-together thrill comes from the game working differently.

I'm talking about simply looking at the experience progression in a different way.  Instead of it representing a character's groth, it's representing that character's power of technical ability being unlocked as the story progresses.  The mage could know that world-ending spell the whole time, and not use it until a higher level because it doesn't make sense within the narrative.<br><br>I'm a bit confused.  JBR, are you saying that starting a game with a rich, detailed character is a bad thing?<br><br>Also, I don't know if you're reading what I'm saying correctly.  I'm not specifically talking about defining everything beforehand.  I'm talking about starting a game, at level 1, as the greatest general of the nation.  As play proceeds (and experience accumulates), more abilities and traits manifest - things which are assumed to have always been there, but never had the right moment to arise.  They don't have to necessarily all be written down before the game, but when they are gained through play, they come out of the woodwork.  And so does the narrative.  In the TV Show Firefly, for example, there's an episode which features an old war-buddy of Mal and Zoe.  This guy is never mentioned before, but when he enters the scene they already have a strong bond.  Likewise, in another episode they point out a trait that has never surfaced before: their habit of eating apples by slicing them with knives.<br><br/>In many animes, the "party" features characters of multiple levels of ability.  Lodoss Wars is one that comes to mind.  You don't enter the show knowing every spell the wizard can cast, but when the time comes and he casts it, you assume it was already known.<br/><br/>If that perspective is applied to a traditional experience level game, as long as the players and GM are on the same page of perspective, I don't see it being much of a problem.<br/><br/>And don't get me wrong, I'm not proposing completely replacing the ability to advance and develop!  They can <i>both</i> function side by side.  A scar is gained as a lesson, an ability is taught by a master, but then later a secret final attack is unveiled, one which was known all along but the warrior swore to never ever use again, and so on.<br/><br/>Essentially, I'm proposing an optional way of looking at experience levels.  Sure they function well for their intended purpose (advancement), but I think they can function just as well to slowly unlock lost, forgotten, hidden, or merely unstated memories and lessons from the past, as well.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phasmaphobic" title="phasmaphobic"><img alt="phasmaphobic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stuff.realitymerchants.com/pics/drg01.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phasmaphobic">phasmaphobic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73681/#Comment_73681" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-04T16:35:48+00:00" title="June  4, 2007  4:35PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2007 4:39PM by phasmaphobic.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's like looking at the technical experience in the same way as you look at new plot elements.  The GM can introduce a character you've never met before, right?  A bad guy, store clerk, distant prince, etc.  The game goes on and you experience the real-time development of a relationship with this character.<br/><br/>But on the other hand, the GM can also introduce a character you've known for years.  You meet a long-lost cousin in a bar during the 9th session of the game, a childhood friend calls you up out of nowhere after months of play, and so on.<br/><br/>Just because these NPCs were not previously-written by anyone before the game doesn't make them less valid once they're in.  With a shift in perspective and a little narrative empowerment, the same can be applies to actual character abilities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73683/#Comment_73683" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-04T16:43:37+00:00" title="June  4, 2007  4:43PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2007 4:46PM by John_Harper.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nathanael, as far as I can tell, you and JBR are loudly agreeing with each other.

I believe my normal group (with whom I've been playing other such games) might be looking for a pick-up game soon.  I'm considering giving this a try, perhaps run a one-shot with an adopted group cohesion similar to that in the old Battle Chasers comics - characters would range from the world's greatest wizard to a weak little kid with a great destiny, yet all at level 1.

When encounters arise, the players can "set their own handicap," so to speak, choosing which version of their character they wish to use to combat the encounter.  Some variable tokens could even be used to purchase the power level before or mid-scene, and the rewards, instead of typical XP, could be something more abstract, like plot tokens, bennies, etc.  The greater the difference between your handicap (low levels) and the challenge, the greater your story reward for overcoming it.<br/><br/>This could be looked at in a few different lights.  It could be seen as your character choosing to "pull out all the guns" and draw upon all their strengths and powers for a major encounter.  Or instead, a character that is inexperienced could be drawing upon some inner fate or destiny to assist them, guardian angels, mystic fortunes, the pwoer of will alone, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74058/#Comment_74058" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-06T14:09:00+00:00" title="June  6, 2007  2:09PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: phasmaphobic</cite>This could be looked at in a few different lights.

Seems like this would be a keen way to do a "the more powerful I am, the more out of control I become" kind of a thing - maybe the characters have nasty urges, and keeping their abilities in check is the only way to control those urges.
