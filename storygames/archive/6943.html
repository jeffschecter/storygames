Each member of a group reads a text, and interprets it in different ways.  This might be based on their own past experience, which parts they like or don't like, which parts catch their attention or don't, and so forth.<br/><br/>There's also how each person puts their own individual interpretation into practice.  Each person's individual interpretation influences what actions they take in myriad ways.<br/><br/>Then there's how the group functions as a system.  In other words, we can examine how each individual's actions fit into the overall group context, how much synergy there is between them.<br/><br/>And lastly, there's what ideas the group shares.  Not only am I talking about a shared concept of what the text means, but also the other ideas the group brings to the text, their cultural values and priorities, and so forth.<br/><br/>The neat part is that these four aspects are "tetra-arising" -- they're simultaneous, interdependent, and co-creating.  Individuals affect the group as a whole, and vice versa.  Ideas, values, and priorities affect procedures and actions, and vice versa.  And all of it happens at the same time, all the time.<br/><br/>For example, the group may read the text, sit down to play, and then find that something just isn't working.  They might then realize that their individual interpretations differ, or that they agree but maybe aren't reading the text as intended.  Or, they might bring idiosyncratic cultural values to a text, and play it differently than other groups would.<br/><br/>I think it's really cool to see the links between these aspects being discussed.  Just wanted to share how I see them all fitting together, my own personal big picture, if you will.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154668/#Comment_154668" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-03T10:12:36+00:00" title="July  3, 2008 10:12AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Max,<br/><br/>Smart.<br/><br/>So, there's a challenge to designing a game that folks don't much talk about: when you have an expectation of producing stories within a genre, what do you do about players who don't all already understand the genre of the game you're designing? Lots of games don't even identify the problem. They just expect everyone to know and understand the genre. Some games try to solve the problem by providing a bunch of setting material, and/or ancillary fiction, or suggested film and reading lists, with the implied expectation that they'll be used somehow by a group to understand the genre. But in practice a lot of genre gets taught in play, informally, via feedback and suggestions.<br/><br/>And with the latter, when you have players with sketchy understandings of the genre, there's this thing I think of as a least common denominator effect: a player who doesn't understand the genre tends to tip-toe around doing what seem like safe things (safe, based on play assumptions from the game's culture, as we've been discussing, or safe, based on the sketchy understanding of the game's genre). And there are all sorts of consequences from this. Mostly though, stuff gets instantiated in the fiction that takes the game away from the rich and nuanced core of the genre.<br/><br/>So the design challenge sort-of becomes: how do you teach genre in play? And the answer...at least the one I've been toying with...is to design at the level of your four aspects. So that the whole group mastery of the genre is not left to the informality which produces a weak genre foundation in early play. So that the whole group mastery of genre is greater than the sum of the parts.<br/><br/>For instance, Acts of Evil has suffered from a least common denominator effect in the form of players repetitively going for small, squalid, often sexual beat-downs of NPCs, rather than more cinematic expressions of power, truly disturbing cultural effects, and adulterations of human values. So in an earlier iteration of Acts of Evil I had a mechanic called Concomitance that encouraged players to take input on their character actions prior to a die roll by requiring if they didn't that they'd take input after the die roll. I believed the whole group understanding of the genre would trump "safe" choices via this Concomitance mechanic.<br/><br/>It actually didn't work so well. But you get the point. The edge of game design is crafting the social architecture.<br/><br/>(I've recently solved that particular least common denominator effect for Acts of Evil. The game now teaches its genre in play. And I did it by designing at the social architecture.)<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154695/#Comment_154695" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-03T12:31:34+00:00" title="July  3, 2008 12:31PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Max,<br/><br/>The way I think about groups implementing roleplaying texts is strongly influences by reading about intercultural communication.  For example, one of the most influential books for me is Richard White's <i>The Middle Ground</i>.  As I posted somewhere else:\n<blockquote>White's book is about Native American and European interactions during a specific period of French colonialism in the Great Lakes region. His central argument is that -- because neither side had the power to dictate the rules of how the relationship between them could be conducted -- they created their own system of interaction through a process of trial and error, a pidgin in-between culture founded on misunderstanding the intentions of the other. For example, the French would do one thing, hoping for a certain kind of reaction from the native peoples, and the native peoples would do something else, maybe in response, maybe totally unrelated, and, over time, this formed a set of rituals, rituals that weren't things native people or French people would ever normally do, but rituals that only had meaning when certain French and Native American people performed them together. Otherwise, they were meaningless. These rituals were both an artifact of intercultural communication and a method of communicating between the cultures. So, basically, before they could communicate, both sides had to collectively create a system for communicating, basically through misinterpreting what the other side was doing.</blockquote>\nIn my mind, this is what happens within a roleplaying group, with the text playing a role similar to, say, the French system of etiquette in the interactions White describes.  Some of the people involved in negotiating with native people knew about etiquette, but some didn't.  Some were just these trappers out in the woods with minimal or no formal education.  Often times, they made up stuff that was inspired by what they'd seen upper class French folks do.  Likewise, in a roleplaying group, how often is it that everyone's read the text recently?  Maybe the person who's organizing it read it the day before, but some people may have read bits of the text a long time ago, some people may have read about it on the internet, some people may make stuff up based on what they think it is, and some people may take their cues from what everybody else does, or based on their own distinct roleplaying background.<br/><br/>So what develops over time is a set of norms for how a specific group plays game X, which is probably pretty different from how other people do it, and the text plays a role in shaping that, but it isn't necessarily the most significant role.  And I think texts are more effective when they take that into consideration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154700/#Comment_154700" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-03T13:03:53+00:00" title="July  3, 2008  1:03PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Jonathan, this clearly explains some of my problems/opinions.<br/>I assume that all players have read the text and remember most of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154705/#Comment_154705" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-03T13:16:07+00:00" title="July  3, 2008  1:16PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I print the pdf, I mark it with a red pen to find quickly anything I could misremember during the game. Sometimes, it there are too many rules (but we avoid these games these day, to give you an example Bliss Stage was almost too rules-heavy) someone write a very short mnemonic summary of the rules. After the first one-two sessions I re-check the printed copy marking anything we misremembered.  And the first one or two sessions are considered "trial runs" where we often stop the game to check on the rules.<br/><br/>I don't really see a better way to be sure that I didn't waste my money buying a game and playing another that I already know.

It's amazing to see how modifications to the social architecture of a group can change the whole feel of play.  It's also amazing to see how, for a certain group, some attempted modifications take hold, and others fall flat.  This problem is related in a lot of ways to group culture, how individuals interpret the textual calls for these architectural modifications, and how they put them into practice -- no surprise there, given what I said above.  In a general sense, if one of these four aspects should work but doesn't, the problems is likely to lie with one of the <i>other</i> aspects.<br/><br/>Re the process of individual interpretation:  Not everyone will remember every word of the text.  Which things people remember is hugely important, not only because of which rules that implies are missing in their mental model of the game, but also because of how those gaps influence the ways that they interpret the pieces they do remember.  Question: How do you design for this?  Can you design for this?  Maybe you could use text layout somehow...<br/><br/>Re the process of cultural construction:  It's a really good point that group culture is often formed by a series of misunderstandings.  As J-Walt points out, these misunderstandings are often the result of differing (mis)interpretations of the same source material, or even different source material altogether.  In the case of roleplaying, that source material might be other games and past experiences playing them, or it might extend to experiences outside of roleplaying.  As the process continues, it feeds back on itself -- individuals craft new interpretations based on the events happening in the group (and their past interpretations!), which causes them to act differently in the future, which alters the functioning of the overall system that is the group, which over time shifts shared values and priorities and ideas, and thus individual interpretations -- around and around again.  You can run the circle in the other direction too.<br/><br/>Re interpretation and fidelity to the text:  There are two things I want to say here, and I swear they aren't contradictory.  First, everyone's interpretation of a text has value, and second, some interpretations are better than others.  The text will be interpreted differently in different group contexts, and that's both fundamentally unavoidable and fundamentally OK.  Each perspective has some merit -- but not necessarily equal merit.  Some interpretations will come closer to the textual instructions or author's intent than others, some will more reliably deliver fun than others, some will create more efficient and effectual social architectures than others, and so on.  No matter what criteria we pick for "better," some interpretations will more naturally create that than others.  None of that changes the fundamental OKness of having whatever interpretation you happen to have.<br/><br/>So, good points all.  You made me think through it a bit more, which I like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154716/#Comment_154716" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-03T14:21:53+00:00" title="July  3, 2008  2:21PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite>Max: the major thing about your four aspects that jumps out at me is the first one.

Even if someone doesn't read the text, they still have some individual idea of how the game is supposed to be played.  Where does it come from?  From the other people at the table, over time, one supposes.  That oughta have a rather large effect on how the game is played, it seems to me.  But it can still be explained in terms of individual and shared ideas, priorities, values, and expectations, and individual and systemic actions, interactions, and procedures.

It's not like everyone just has one style of play that they do all the time.  Most likely, each person is comfortable with a handful of different styles of play cultivated within different play groups over their play history.  And, when encountering a new group or a new game, they're likely to pick one or shift between a few of them until they find a style that seems to work with the new group or game.  And, from that foundation, a new group culture is (mis)constructed.  But you have all these norms from different play groups in players' pasts interacting together at the table, where they may or may not gel and/or lead to the improvisation and eventual (informal) institutionalization in the new group's play culture.<br/><br/>For me, then, one of the most interesting things about a text is the ways in which it assists players in taking their personal play history, picking out the parts that are relevant to this particular game, and then -- with everyone else at the table -- taking the diverse things people are bringing to the table and creating something workable and (hopefully) enjoyable out of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155285/#Comment_155285" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-07T18:40:50+00:00" title="July  7, 2008  6:40PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like the culture-based approach, and I think it's got some very interesting things to tell us.

I'd be curious to hear more of what you're thinking there.<br/><br/>There's another approach, which I think also has interesting things going on, but which seems to be less popular.  Of course, that would be an individual based approach.  I think it might look at the linkage between individual ideas/interpretations/motivations and individual actions.  One of the more obvious ways to approach this would be introspection.  The barrier to doing that seems to be a general cultural aversion to 'getting in people's heads' -- even our own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155301/#Comment_155301" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-07T21:25:32+00:00" title="July  7, 2008  9:25PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everyone plays every game differently at every second that they play.

[if a big bad big modle mamajama wanted to correct/confirm would be great). You have the text contributing techniques, you have the players contributing techniques. But if you wanted a text that emphasised/worked with the player's play history you would have to know something about that play history, which if your going to do on a largish scale is gonna smush a lot of the "i'm a precious snowflake" of play culture and identity stuff going on<br/>\n<br/>\nLogos                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155361/#Comment_155361" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-08T07:47:27+00:00" title="July  8, 2008  7:47AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Everyone plays every game differently at every second that they play.

It sounds like you're arguing against the idea that there's a right way to play given a particular text, which I don't think anyone upthread has endorsed.  If by 'wrong' you mean 'in a way different from what the author would have imagined or intended,' then I half-way agree -- factually this seems true, but I wouldn't attach a value judgment like 'wrong' to it.<br/><br/>What I am saying is that everyone plays in a certain way, and that whatever that way is, it can be influenced by a number of interrelated factors.  Depending on what the goal is, some ways will achieve that goal better than others.  But then, some goals will simply be unachievable -- one of those would be the goal to play the game as the author intended.  Still doesn't mean we can't get comparatively clos<i>er</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
