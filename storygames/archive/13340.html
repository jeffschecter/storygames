It's a die pool system where players can choose to roll as many or as few dice as they like up to their maximum. However, tasks can have both a Difficulty and a Threat. Any die that rolls over the difficulty guarantees you success, but any die that rolls under the Threat is lost, representing damage of one kind or another. Therefore the more dice you roll, the more likely you are to succeed, but the more likely you are to get hurt if there is a Threat in the current roll.<br><br>I liked it because it's such an adaptable system. You can have tasks that are difficult but non-threatening, such as calculating a tricky mathematical formula. You can have tasks that have zero difficulty but are likely to get you hurt, such as reaching into a bramble bush to retrieve an important key. Or you can have tasks that are both dangerous and difficult.<br><br>-Ash                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300699/#Comment_300699" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-13T14:12:43+00:00" title="November 13, 2010  2:12PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James Mullen</cite><br>Are there any other games that have such 'dips' in the linear progression of more dice=better result?

It does something different, but on a similar wavelength.<br><br>In Ghost/Echo, you roll 2 dice - one for Goal, one for Danger. 3-4's are a borderline success/neutral result. 5-6's are successes. Allocate your dice as you see fit, between your Goal and your Danger.<br><br>You can add additional Dangers in order to add additional dice. So, if you have 1 Goal and 3 Dangers, you roll 4 dice and allocate as desired.<br><br>With the basic two dice, it's quite possible to roll a 5 and a 6, and avert all crises. But it's not a guarantee that you'll get <i>any</i> successes, either.<br/><br/>Let's say you really, really, <i>really</i> want that Goal to come true. Let's say that Goal is "Rescue Coil before the Spider Queen gets to him." And the danger is "Get Bitten by the Spider Queen." You could just roll, but there's a pretty significant chance that you'll roll a 1 and a 3, or something like that. So, you could add more dangers: "Her minions block your exit," and "Slink hears the commotion and tracks you guys down." Now you're rolling 4 dice! You're almost guaranteed to succeed at your Goal, if that's your top priority. You're also almost guaranteed to have at least one Danger come true, probably more.<br/><br/>In Ghost/Echo, rolling more dice means it's more likely to get you exactly what you want, but at the cost of more problems.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300708/#Comment_300708" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-13T18:52:59+00:00" title="November 13, 2010  6:52PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not familiar with other games which do what the OP suggests (I don't think Ghost/Echo is the exact same thing, really), but I might suggest "overkill" as a potential term to discuss, one that would be interesting to see explored in more games.

For each point in the trait you're using to achieve that Goal, roll one die. For each die you roll beyond the first, everyone at the table gets to devise one Complication that could happen because of your attempt, or could just happen regardless. None of these Goals or Complications can be specifically reliant on one another happening.<br/><br/>Thus, you really want to max out at around 2 or 3 dice, I think. Keep in mind that the rating of the trait isn't the efficacy of some skill you possess - it's merely the approach you take, and how chaotic and worse-making it is. I suppose the low ideal trait ratings mean that players are encouraged to spread things out a bit  - I also added in the efficacy of special gear or locations that add straight-up +1's to your dice, as you see fit, instead of giving you *more* dice. Such gear and locations are hard, indeed, to come by - everybody gets one, to start, and they are all places or things that could transfer "ownership" in some way. The ideal situation would be to get a trait rated at only 1, and get a +3-quality tool or location. <br/><br/>I think I actually need to go back and highlight that in the rules - at least point out the best odds of getting a single success, as a design feature. <br/>By the way - the result of play-testing my game is that everybody tends to already be a glutton for punishment, since we didn't highlight moderation in trait ratings. If you aren't interested in trying to encourage people to want to suffer, or can't find any such players, see what happens if you encourage moderation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300715/#Comment_300715" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-14T00:04:02+00:00" title="November 14, 2010 12:04AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 14, 2010 2:27AM by James_Mullen.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is a distinction to be made here between two different styles of measuring outcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, the most popular type, are systems where chance/quality of success rises hand in hand with risk/price of that action, e.g. each die you add to your pool increases both, which are measured separately. For example, Ghost/Echo, where you can earn more dice by bringing in more Dangers, but are more likely to trigger one of those Dangers as a result; this is the style we can call "Overkill."<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, there are systems where the types of outcome you get on your roll are not arranged from lowest to highest in the order Good-&gt;Better-&gt;Best, e.g. where a small number of successes on your roll is Good and a large number is Best but an average number of successes is actually Bad or Worse. That's the sort of thing that happens in Never to Die, so I'll call that style "Disarray." I believe that <b>Bliss Stage</b> has a disarray model, since getting too many successes can be as bad as not getting enough, but that's more of a peak than a dip: a small number is Bad and a large number is Good, but an average number is Best, depending on the targets set by the GM.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Edit:</b> On reflection, these are two sides of the same coin:<br/>\n<br/>\n<b><i>Peak:</i></b><i> AKA "Overkill."</i> The sweet spot for success is in the middle; too small a dice pool and you risk failure, too large and you can pay a heavy price, but in the middle is just right.<br/>\n<b><i>Dip:</i></b> <i>AKA "Disarray."</i> The sweet spots for success are at the ends; small pools get small successes, large pools get large successes, but in-between them is a danger zone you can fall into where you pay a price for what happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat interests me about this now is the new game I'm working on, which allows you to gamble with getting a Peak or a Dip; you build a pool of Fudge dice and roll them against a target. If <i>both</i> your + and - results are greater than the target, you succeed ("Yes"), but if <i>only</i> your +s beat the target, you get a "Yes, and..." result, while if <i>only</i> your -s beat it, you get a "Yes, but...". Building a large pool can almost guarantee you a normal success, but you can build a smaller pool if you want to take the risk.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
