                    I've been participating on a few local groups and boards: <a href="http://www.techfix.net//cvgamers/nfphpbb/" rel="nofollow">CVGamers boards</a> and the yahoo group for a local <a href="http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/DnD_LibraryMeetup/" rel="nofollow">Library Meetup</a> group.  They've proved somewhat useful for finding game days, local RPGA events, and the like.<br/><br/>After finding that people still aren't assembling groups very successfully, I finally took the plunge and have started a local mailing list, modeled on the <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=16760.0" rel="nofollow">Stealth Gamers</a> Forge post.<br/><br/>So, a few things:  <br/>First, thanks to James for talking about Stealth Gamers and providing a useful model I could crib from.<br/>Second, if you're in Fresno (or are somewhere nearby) and are looking to join a PTA game, let me know.<br/>Third, if you're not looking to play PTA, but are gaming in the area, contact fga [at] scottrpg.com and I'll add you to a games announcement list, so you'll know what games are available to join.                </div>

                            Here's a link to <a href="http://www.techfix.net//cvgamers/nfphpbb/viewtopic.php?t=443" rel="nofollow">the post</a> I put up on the local gameboard (CVGamers)--  do you have any advice on how to tweak it to maximize responses, or advice on where I've gone wrong.  Was this a foolish project to take on, is it something you wish was around your hometown?                        </div>

                            Hi Scott,<br/><br/>I've passed the email along to a girl I know in Fresno who's always complaining about being bored.<br/><br/>The post looks fine to me. As for the project: like most things, it's worth a shot. If it takes off, it takes off, and if it doesn't, than you've probably made a couple of contacts on the way.<br/><br/>Good luck with it.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>
