There were five players: Jay (a biology professor), Jim (a history professor), Jay\u2019s two sons Maxwell (a fifth-grader) and Jack (a third-grader), and Jim\u2019s son Oscar (a first-grader). Jim and Oscar \u201cshared\u201d their character (Dominic Belinfante, a dragonborn warlord). Jay played Finfang, a dragonborn wizard, Maxwell was Kondax the Traveler, a dragonborn paladin of Bahamut, and Jack played Moridai, a tiefling rogue. Missing from the group\u2014having been there last week for world-building and character creation\u2014were Oscar\u2019s brother Tom (another fifth grader), Tom\u2019s friend David (ditto), and David\u2019s dad John (a math professor) ; Tom and David had both come down with a 24-hour bug of some kind. It was ironic that those two fifth-graders were absent, since it was Tom\u2019s interest in D&amp;D in the first place that had set events in motion.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the game did not wholly hold the attention of the two younger boys; after a while they bounced downstairs to go play on the Wii with my daughter Hannah, Oscar\u2019s classmate.  Occasionally, Jack would bounce back up to see what has happening, and was present at the finale of the two-hour session. But the target audience\u2014Max, the fifth-grader\u2014really dug it. Jay was impressed with how the game sustained Max\u2019s attention, and with Max\u2019s ability to make real contributions to the on-going fiction. Jay never played as a teenager, but had friends who did; they would ask him to draw their characters for them. He says he now regrets not having tried the game in high school.<br/><br/>Last week, we collaboratively built the campaign world. This involved a little mini-game that made use of a 22-card Deck of Many Things (some of you will recall the magic item of the same name from AD&amp;D). Each card of the deck has a name like \u201cBalance\u201d or \u201cKnight\u201d or \u201cDonjon,\u201d and I found out that those names correspond pretty nicely with the portfolios of the 20 canonical deities from 4E; \u201cBalance\u201d was Bahamut (Dragon-God of Justice), \u201cKnight\u201d was Kord (God of Battles), \u201cDonjon\u201d was Torog (Rat-God of the Underworld) and so forth. All I had to do was create two new deities for the extra cards, which was easy.<br/><br/>The world-building mini-game worked very well. I took a piece of poster board and put it the middle of the table, and then drew nine overlapping circles in pencil on what was now our world map. I put one card face-down in each circle, and then dealt the rest of the cards out to the players. \u201cOn your turn,\u201d I told them, \u201cyou can either explore a new region by flipping over one of the cards on the map and playing a card from your hand, reading the two cards together to say what this region is like. Or you can play a card to an already defined region, adding a location or event to it.\u201d To demonstrate, I took the first turn. \u201cI will flip over this card right in the middle of the map and it\u2019s Comet [Avandra\u2014merchants, travel, adventure, luck]. I\u2019ll play my only card, Skull [Vecna\u2014secrets, undeath] in this area. Now I read the two cards together. The combination puts me in mind of a city of conniving merchant princes who engage in elaborate schemes. And maybe some of them are vampires.\u201d I wrote Mankara, City of Masks on the map, and drew a crude picture of a walled city with square towers.<br/><br/>They got the idea, although one of the 11-year-olds decided that he would create a place called \u201cIdiotopolis,\u201d which made us grown-ups roll our eyes, but as the description of the place emerged, it turned out to be a ruin inhabited by crazed cannibals, which is kind of awesome, and then someone added a soul-sucking Soul Void to the region, so that Tharizduna (the \u201creal name\u201d of the place, at least in my mind; Idiotopolis would be its colloquial name)  was now filled with crazed and soulless cannibals, and in my head I went, Okay. Flesh-eating zombies. I can work with that.<br/><br/>The other places they created included Great Brazond, home of the Machinesmith Orcs who build terrible weapons and war machines; Sulfur Swamp, where lizard people lurk; the Cold Waste of Gomondor, where evil gnomes plot conquest to fulfill their leader\u2019s prophesied destiny; the Towers of Ioun, a high elven city dedicated to learning; the Caves of Chaos, huge caverns wherein lightning storms rage; the Wilderness of Bahamut, a forested region of eternal summer; and the Mountains of the Moon, where wizards watch the goings-on of the world via their crystal balls.<br/><br/>I then stepped them through character creation. I had them draw one card to be their \u201cpatron\u201d and one to be their \u201cnemesis,\u201d hoping to inspire some interesting character ideas that way. There was a little confusion there, since Max wanted to be a paladin of Bahamut even though his patron card was Kord, and he wondered if it would be all right to do that (of course it would).  But overall the players did a fine job with that. The other two fifth-graders made lone wolf-type rogues. David\u2019s character Dimitrios was an orphan raised and trained by a thief who lived in the Caves of Chaos and had just been killed by a wurm, leaving Dimitrios on his own. Similarly, Tom\u2019s character \u201cMy name is unpronounceable in your language, but you can call me Joe\u201d was born in  a village of half-elf, half-serpent people who had been conquered and destroyed by the evil gnomes, leaving Joe as the sole revenge-bent survivor. I found the difference between the two characters very interesting: some players like to have a backstory that drives play, and others to have one that gets out of the way of play. Even at 11 years old. But those were the two boys who were sick, so I didn\u2019t get a chance to see their characters in action.<br/><br/>When we convened on Saturday, I had each of the players declare a \u201cpersonal quest\u201d for their characters. Jim decided (with Oscar\u2019s approval) that Dominick was seeking his long-lost father, rumored to have been imprisoned somewhere in the Caves of Chaos. Jay wanted Finfang to retrieve the Midnight Sun Orb from the Mountains of the Moon in order to destroy the Vampire Princes of Mankara at night. Young Jack wants to have Moridai steal parts from the Machinesmith Orcs to make weapons. Originally, he included weapons like \u201cnukes\u201d in his wish list, which met with some grown-up disapproval on the grounds of thematic inappropriateness. However, I was able to suggest that there is some fantasy in which a kind of techno-magic makes its appearance, and so we changed nukes to spell bombs (as seen in <i>Magic: The Gathering</i>). \u201cI still want a missile launcher, though,\u201d said Jack (so I\u2019m going to have to see what I can do). Maxwell created the quest \u201cRetrieve the Amulet of the Sky and conquer Mankara,\u201d which I split into its two component halves. \u201cConquering Mankara is a big deal,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m going to make that a major quest.\u201d<br/><br/>Formalized quests are at the center of my conception of how to run D&amp;D 4e, with its heavy emphasis on the set-piece encounter as the building block of play, in a story-friendly way. Players specify the quests they want their characters to be pursuing, and each quest has a level that reflects its difficulty. The characters then face encounters, also measured in levels (randomly determined by a special card draw at the beginning of the scene); at the end of the encounter, its levels can be divided among those quests. The last time I ran D&amp;D, once you allocated completed encounter levels to an ongoing quest, the quest was completed; completing a quest let you draw a card from the Deck of Many Things and narrate it as the resolution or outcome of the quest.  The nice thing about this system is that everything the characters did contributed to moving the action forward.<br/><br/>I am in the process of revamping the quest rules, however, so that (1) there\u2019s an element of strategic choice involved, and (2) the resolution of the quest is a challenge rather than being anti-climactic. To that end, I\u2019m thinking that (a) the quest level is unknown to the players; (b) the difference between the encounter levels allocated to the quest and the quest level serves as a modifier to the level of the encounter the players face when they are finally in a position to resolve the quest; and (c) there should be some way that fulfilled quests can provide \u201cbonus levels\u201d to other quests in a way that makes it cost-effective to pursue subordinate quests before tackling the final objective. So \u201cBring the Ring to Mordor and throw it the Fires of Mt. Doom\u201d is a major quest, with \u201cBring the Ring to Rivendell and the House of Elrond\u201d as a subordinate quest whose completion contributes to the ability to resolve the major quest.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309418/#Comment_309418" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-24T20:40:24+00:00" title="January 24, 2011  8:40PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2011 9:48PM by Bill_White.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Once quests were established, it was time to actually begin the game\u2014\u201cHere the adventure began in earnest,\u201d as Gary Gygax would have said. Based on the character\u2019s backstories, it made sense for Jay\u2019s character Finfang to be fleeing from Mankara to the Towers of Ioun while the others were traveling in the opposite direction. I have a bunch of battlemats I\u2019ve saved, scrounged, or borrowed from my brother Mel over the years, and some miniatures likewise. I broke out a mat that said \u201croad in the country,\u201d told the players where to put their minis, and ran a fight where the three characters coming from one direction saw Finfang being chased by two cloaked figures who seemed to have moving shadows tattooed on their faces. The two shadow-men warned the others not to interfere with the business of the \u201cLord and Lady of Mankara\u201d (who I\u2019ve decided are the boss bad guys in that city).<br/><br/>The players then decided that they would head south to the Caves of Chaos\u2014I think mainly because it sounded cool. The card I drew next was a \u201cspecial encounter,\u201d which I had decided would be for things like hearing rumors, meeting important or helpful NPCs, and the like. So I had them meet a high elven ranger as they entered the Wilderness en route to the Caves of Chaos; the eladrin warned them of slavers dragging people to the Caves, never to return. This was followed by a treasure card, so the ranger gave them a suit of +1 leather as a token of respect for their bravery in choosing to continue toward the Caves.<br/><br/>Then I drew a card for a level 3 encounter, which gave me a 300 xp budget, which I used on 4 minions and a leader that I had previously written up. The leader was actually somewhat overpowered, so I downgraded him on the fly so that he was less instantly deadly. Luckily, I had just read Rob Donoghue\u2019s blog <i><a href="http://rdonoghue.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Some Space To Think</a></i> where he talks about integrating skill challenges into set-piece encounters, and so when I set down a map that had a woodland stream running through it, I took away 20 hp from the leader to use as \u201csituation points\u201d that could be reduced by using skills to attempt to bridge or ford the stream.<br/><br/>The minions I called \u201cman-catchers\u201d and their leader an \u201cenforcer,\u201d but they were just re-skinned critters from the <i>Monster Manual</i>. I set out the map, told them about the skil challenge, and had them roll initiative. Jack won initiative and tried to cross the stream, but blew his Endurance roll and wound up getting tossed around by the current\u2014essentially, the stream attacked vs. Fortitude each turn for 1d4 damage. Max and Jim started working on building a bridge out of rope so that everyone could cross the stream safely.<br/><br/>At this point, the bad guys showed up; vile-looking desperadoes bearing whips, chains, and nets. \u201cThere\u2019s a fine looking bunch!\u201d said their leader. \u201cThey\u2019ll fetch a fine price at the Caves of Chaos!\u201d Jay stepped up and we had a fine old battle, with his dragonborn wizard casting Sleep on the minions, firing Magic Missiles and breathing acid on the leader, trying to hold them off long enough for the bridge to be complete. Luckily, they finished the job and everyone scampered across. Finfang the wizard got tangled in a net as he tried to cross, but Max\u2019s character threw him a rope and pulled him to safety. The evil leader\u2014\u201cLet\u2019s call him Drake,\u201d I said\u2014shook his fist at the departing heroes and vowed that he\u2019d see them again someday, particularly the wizard.<br/><br/>All in all, a very positive first session, with lots of good energy and enthusiasm from the players and some real interest in continuing. I\u2019m looking forward to the next session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309424/#Comment_309424" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-24T22:01:54+00:00" title="January 24, 2011 10:01PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds pretty great.

That's the experiment I'm trying with this little mini-campaign. I will have to work hard to improve my sense of stagecraft, so that while the PCs' opponents are fighting them, they're also delivering evocative and useful in-game information. "Arg! Ye've wounded me to the quick! 'Tis no matter! Now I can go to the grave and never reveal to ye the secret ways into the Caves of Chaos! Ye fools!" Something like that, anyway. But the upshot is that the kewl powerz are always at least potentially relevant, because the world happens in combat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309482/#Comment_309482" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T07:41:36+00:00" title="January 25, 2011  7:41AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 25, 2011 7:43AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>the Towers of Ioun, a high elven city dedicated to learning;</blockquote>\nOf <em>course</em> you had an ivory tower.

So, if you describe your action in a way the makes the flavor text "come alive", the DM can award you a stunt die based on how awesome the description was. This extra die can be added to one of the d20 rolls (if any) called for by the power. Basic award is a d4 just for the attempt, but if the description is evocative and cool, d6. If the whole table gives a "holy crap!" reaction, d8.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome d20 games add dice like this by spending "action points" or something (I think Eberron worked like this), so this is sort of a similar thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrawback is that it is even more crap to track, and how the NPCs use it is open to discussion.

There were 8 PCs, including the four from last week\u2014(1) Finfang the dragonborn wizard (played by Jay the bio professor), (2) Kondax the Traveler, a dragonborn paladin of Bahamut (played by Max the 5th grader), (3) Moridai the tiefling rogue (played by Jack the 3rd grader), and (4) Dominick Belinfante, the dragonborn warlord (played by Oscar, the 1st grader, with support from his dad Jim)\u2014as well as four new characters: (5) \u201cCall-me-Joe,\u201d half-elf rogue (played by Tom, another 5th  grader), (6) Dimitrios, human rogue (played by David, the third 5th grader), (7) Saeldur the wood elven priest of Tiamat (played by John, David\u2019s dad, a math professor who had played AD&amp;D in high school), and (8) Rugg, the human fighter (played by Luke, a friend who had played in my last 4E mini-campaign; in the past he\u2019s also played Amber Diceless, Seventh Sea, and previous versions of D&amp;D).<br/><br/>Eight PCs (and nine players) is probably a little too big, especially given the limited attention spans of the youngest players; most of the 5th graders hit the wall at the 1 hour 40 minute mark, bouncing back to take their turns during the extensive combat rounds\u2014a definite weakness of 4E, exacerbated to some degree by the fact that some players were new. We only managed to get through one long encounter and start  a second, but there was a lot of action, and the grown-ups at least were engaged.<br/><br/>For the first encounter, I brought out two gridless terrain sections, A4 sheets with a path through a forest figured on them. I\u2019ve had them for decades, literally; they\u2019re part of the old \u201cEndless Plans\u201d series of dungeon geomorphs that came out in the early 1980s. \u201cYou guys,\u201d I said to the first group, \u201care heading south toward the Caves of Chaos.\u201d I put them on one map section facing one way. To the new guys I said, \u201cYou guys are coming north having just left the area near the Caves of Chaos.\u201d I put them on the other map section facing the other direction. \u201cYou can just see each other. Also, you can hear from the north a noise that sounds like trees being ripped from the earth. Everyone, roll initiative.\u201d<br/><br/>Nine-year-old Jack\u2019s PC moved south and readied some shuriken to throw at the other guys; his dad Jay and his older brother Max moved up to restrain him. David\u2019s rogue climbed a tree, at which point I showed them the purple worm that was headed their way, putting down a third forest geomorph to the north. Next round, a whole bunch of panicked forest animals came charging toward them, fleeing the purple worm\u2019s path of destruction\u2014I put down an assortment of wolf tokens that I\u2019d gathered from <i>Dragon</i> magazine inserts and other cardboard heroes collections over the years and moved them to engulf the northernmost group. \u201cThink of the forest fire scene in <i>Bambi</i>,\u201d I said. \u201cFrenzied animals on the run.\u201d <br/><br/>Now, I will admit to making at least one little mistake in staging the scene how I did, in that the most experienced players (with one more session under their belt) were closest to the threat, and so knew what to do right away\u2014grab your d20 and start swinging. The less experienced players were a little more cautious, and so they hung back and found themselves out of the action; I\u2019m thinking of David and Luke in particular, who never really got a chance to do anything. At one point, Jack came up to me and said that I should get <i>another big monster</i> so that the guys in the back would have something to do, but for some reason I didn\u2019t want to do that. But maybe I should have, since (a) escalation is never wrong, and (b) why not have the heroes stumble into the middle of some kind of purple worm mating ritual ? The mouths of babes, as they say.<br/><br/>One thing that I did right, though, was never to say no to having a character try to do something. The first highlight of that fight emerged when Tom suggested that if the blood of the wolves could be smeared on to the rampaging purple worm, the other wolves would be enraged and would turn and attack the purple worm. Max literally ran with that idea. He picked up a dead wolf, hustled up to the purple worm, threw the wolf into the air, and breathed lightning at it, blowing the corpse into bloody gobbets that spattered across the flank of the worm. The wolves of course were too panicked to notice, and the purple worm just kept coming. Max then had to avoid being trampled by the worm and separated from the rest of the group.<br/><br/>I think that seeing Maxwell doing something maybe-stupid, maybe-clever was inspiring, because now the players started getting clever. Jim suggested to Oscar that maybe Dominick Belinfante could \u201corganize a defense\u201d against the worm, and so he rolled his Diplomacy skill successfully and I let him reposition all the PCs on the map (as well as doing damage to the worm\u2019s \u201csituation points,\u201d per Rob Donoghue\u2019s recent <i>Some Space to Think</i> posts). And John, who seemed dissatisfied with picking on the panicked forest creatures to give his allies healing surges, wondered if he could channel his divine power in some way. I reminded him that I\u2019d given him three rituals that he could use, based on three cards from the Deck of Many Things, including the one for Tiamat. He made a successful Religion roll, and I channeled some <i>Final Fantasy</i> to have a five-headed dragoness come down from the clouds and breathe fire, lightning, acid, cold, and\u2014what did the fifth head breathe? I hesitated, trying to remember. But David interjected \u201cSnot!\u201d and everybody laughed, so why not?\u2014some kind of vile mucus upon the purple worm. \u201cDiscouraged, it turns and wanders off in a different direction,\u201d I told them.<br/><br/>So now I know how I will handle ritual casting in this game. You get a ritual and you can use it to do anything appropriate to the portfolio of the god or entity it concerns, with your chance of success dependent upon what you\u2019re trying to do and the defenses of who you\u2019re trying to do it to. The attempt uses up the ritual until you \u201crecharge\u201d it with levels from an encounter you\u2019ve completed. The situation point damage that it does will be very high, equivalent to a daily power (or a \u201climited damage expression,\u201d as the <i>DMG</i> puts it). Beautiful.<br/><br/>Another lesson I learned was not to get too cute with the set-up for an encounter. I thought the scene was going to be about running away from the purple worm, but it didn\u2019t turn out that way; they stood and fought. So all the rules-thought I put into defining each geomorph as a \u201csituation\u201d that movement actions would reduce was not only wasted but besides the point, since it had no real connection to the action. I abandoned it midway through the encounter, and I won\u2019t make that sort of mistake again. If there\u2019s a map, I\u2019ll implement normal movement rules rather than trying to superimpose some abstraction.<br/><br/>But Rob\u2019s situation rules helped address of issue of using your cool powers to do stuff other than attacks, in the sense that since everything is defined in terms of how hard it is to smash (its AC), circumvent (its Reflex defense), manipulate (its Fortitude defense), or understand (its Will defense), if it made sense to attack something, it could be attacked. So later when Jack wanted to use his shuriken (\u201cYour name is now \u2018Shuriken\u2019\u201d his dad told him) to cut through the chains holding Giacomo Belinfante (Dominick\u2019s father) imprisoned in the Caves of Chaos, I could just let him roll a d20 and his damage and based on the result say, \u201cYou\u2019ve freed him from about half of his chains.\u201d<br/><br/>They also helped integrate skills into the action, since they can be assigned a damage value and on a success do something in the current situation. Jay made particularly good use of his Arcana and History skills, for example, discovering in the first scene that \u201cpurple worms are easily distracted,\u201d a fact which I made up. Later, while fighting Machinesmith Orcs (with guns! and whips!) in the Caves of Chaos, Jay wondered about the possibility of him describing the facts that he\u2019d like to be true, rather than me determining it. \u201cI\u2019m willing to allow you to use your knowledge skills to make what are called \u2018declarations\u2019,\u201d I told him. \u201cSo you might say to me, \u2018Excuse me, Dungeon Master\u2014isn\u2019t it the case that such-and-such is true,\u2019 and I\u2019ll tell you what the difficulty of the roll is.\u201d Jay got it right away. \u201cExcuse me, Dungeon Master,\u201d he said, \u201cisn\u2019t it the case that orcs are very pliable, and so if I talk to them in Orcish\u2014which I speak\u2014I might be able to win them over to my side?\u201d Since Jay\u2019s character was a wizard, and considering the example of Saruman, I let him roll for it. But he blew the roll! So he tossed in an action point to re-roll (I let that go) and succeeded, and then tossed in another AP to begin to wheedle them over. Once he does damage equal to the value of a full orc, I\u2019ll give him an orc minion.<br/><br/>Another thing that I did right was having the players make defense rolls rather than the DM making attack rolls. This has a number of nice effects, including the psychological one where when you roll the die you feel like you\u2019re doing something. Additionally, having the player roll means that I can hand out a \u201cblood token\u201d for getting hit as well as for blowing an attack. And since they\u2019ll have blood tokens in their hands in the first place, that defense roll is in fact more under their control.<br/><br/>Playing with the huge age spread is actually a lot of fun. The things you have to concern yourself with are the short attention span and the fondness for things like mucus, but we play in two-hour blocks and roll with what comes. In return, you get some hugely imaginative play. The two youngest boys are frankly a little too young, but they do okay, and the 11-year-olds seem to be having a good time finding their way in the game. It is the grown-ups, it seems to me, who are enjoying themselves the most, both in their own play and in watching their sons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
