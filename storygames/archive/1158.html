                    Cards have come up a couple of times in the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1092" rel="nofollow">recent</a> <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1157" rel="nofollow">dice</a> <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1151" rel="nofollow">threads</a>, and I've been debating starting a "cards" thread. So here it finally is.<br/><br/>Matt Wilson uses cards in Prime Time Adventures (2nd edition) - I believe because they're more familiar to non-gamers, easy to obtain and easy to handle.<br/><br/>Fred (Vaxalon) is using cards, totally appropriately given the importance of the Trumps in the source material, for his Amber game.<br/><br/>I'm using them in both my games-in-development, City of Masks and Errantry. Perhaps my next design challenge is to design a game that <i>doesn't</i> use playing cards.<br/><br/>Anyway, there are lots of ways you can use them, and I'll kick off with what I've done so far in the hope that others will chime in with implemented and unimplemented ideas.<br/><br/>In both games I separate the face cards (J, Q, K) from the pip cards (A-10). That was inspired by someone's passing mention on the Game Chef forums (if I recall correctly) that he was using a split pack like this to replace the various types of dice. He didn't explain in detail, but you can see how this would work: <br/><br/>* d4, either packet, by suit.<br/>* d6, face cards, denomination and colour.<br/>* d8, pip cards, by suit, 6-10 add 4.<br/>* d10, pip cards, denomination.<br/>* d12, face cards, each with a value.<br/>* d20, pip cards, denomination and colour.<br/><br/>EDIT: Of course, you could also do d3/Fudge really easily by denomination of the face cards.<br/><br/>Anyway, in <a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/wiki/pmwiki.php/COM/HomePage" rel="nofollow">City of Masks</a> I use the face cards (plus the Jokers) to represent masks, effectively pre-made sets of attributes which players play both to and against. I use the pip cards to provide a set of random numbers from -10 to +10 which players assign to their characters' relationships with other players and the several factions in the game at the time of character creation. <br/><br/>In <a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/wiki/pmwiki.php/Errantry/HomePage" rel="nofollow">Errantry</a>, the cards are used to generate random encounters, with a bit more sophistication than the old D&amp;D monster tables. When you're in the rotating slot that runs the encounter characters (NPCs), you draw three cards, one face card and two pip cards. <br/><br/>The face card represents the encounter character from then on, so you can re-encounter the same characters in future scenes. <br/><br/>The pip cards' denominations act as a percentile roll which you look up on a table to see what kind of character you've encountered. It's not quite the same as rolling 2d10, because when you draw the second card there's only a 3 in 39 chance instead of a 4 in 40 chance of it being the same denomination as the first one. But it's a randomizer, right? It doesn't have to be statistically exact.<br/><br/>The suits of the three cards, and the denomination of the face card, combine in various ways to generate everything else about the character on a Solar System (TSOY) framework. It's actually quite cunning, and I'm absurdly proud of it, though it remains to be seen how practical it is.<br/><br/>Vax, Matt, anyone else want to comment on what you're doing with cards?                </div>

                            Too Much Rock For One Hand resolves fights by getting both players to draw a card from the other's hand. The winner keeps both cards, which has the effect of diluting a strong hand, making it less effective. The aim of the game is to get as many cards as possible, but the more cards you get, the less effective you become.<br/><br/>Cards are fascinating.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            As a guy who seems to never have a card deck around, I've not really thought about these things.<br/><br/>I did, however, read about <i>Onion Roulette</i> recently, which is apparently a way to do roulette-style bidding on a card deck.  It's not quite as elegant (the odds for some of the allowed bids aren't nice), which just makes me want to retool it into something that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> elegant.<br/><br/>Besides that, I've tinkered with baccarat-type mechanics, where people slap things down on their own piles (and other people's piles) to change their totals.                        </div>

                            I'm using cards in a work-in-progress called Saga. There, I also separate pips and face cards. But the way it works is different:<br/><br/>You establish a stake for the conflict. You draw cards. You discard some. Then the pips are added and decide the stakes winner. The face cards, however, are lined up highest to lowest and compared. Each trick won that way allows a player to change the <i>opposite</i> character, such as inflicting handicaps, establishing influence, or even completely changing character traits.<br/><br/>That way, due to drawing more cards and discarding some, you can choose in every conflict whether it's more important to you to win the stakes or to have an effect on the other player's character.                        </div>

                            Mob Justice uses poker as its skirmish system, allowing for all the bluffing and the like you would expect from a regular game of poker, but in this case the bets are narrative. I myself don't like the idea of using cards merely to replace dice. I think that if you need a number and a dice would do, you may as well use dice over cards as they are simpler and easier for people to grasp, especially when it comes to probabilities. <br/>
<br/>
Cards are very much underused though and I am going to be using them in an upcoming project called 'Arrrrtifact!'. This system uses whist essentially. Each character has a strength which is a trump suit and a weakness which is a suit they can never play their trump suit in. When you play a trick in your trump suit you can use all suits but your weakness as your trump suit. When playing a trick in your weakness you may never trump and the other two sutis just work as for regular whist.<br/>

                            I like cards as randomizers because of the tailorability of custom decks. I've found most mechanics that use prepackaged cards require more pre-work to setup a deck than dice, for about the same results in play.<br/>
<br/>
So one thing to consider is "What can cards do that dice can't?"<br/>
"What can dice do that cards can't?" when you get down to designing for an effect, remember you make too much play go into any mechanic, and all play will be too or for that mechanic (I've had a friend flat out despise Dust Devils because it silenced the game while people messed with card hands.)                        </div>

                            I like cards very muchly. I've used cards in many of my <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.princeofdarknessgames.com" rel="nofollow">RPGs</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Contenders</b>, as mentioned above. Just quicker than dice really, I'm guessing that's why Matt switched to cards in PTA too.<br/>
<b>Call To Adventure</b> - used very simply as a D13 alternative (the game can be played using D12s instead).<br/>
<b>Piledrivers &amp; Powerbombs</b> - now this game uses the true power of cards, allowing bluffs after hands are dealt, player skill comes into the mechanics alongside fortune, allowing a more satisfying Gaming experience (Mob Justice's  poker influenced mechanics do a similar thing).<br/>
<b>Swansong</b> - The tarot deck is an amazing storytelling tool and Swansong expands upon the bluffing mechanics in P&amp;P. The cards make the game, fuelling scenario generation and narrative effects.<br/>
<br/>
For me the big thing cards have going for them is that is more difficult to cheat with cards than with dice. And I often get distracted building dice towers...                        </div>

                            Cards are cetainly very much easier to use in a situation were you want bluffing and maybe even strateigcal play. In Arrrtifcat, the players always have a hand of cards but may not get rid of them without playing them, which means they must choose their moments to be triumphant and to suck. i think cards are very useful resource and almost as common as dice in most people's houses. Not to mention there is a vast array of card game mechanics to draw on from pontoon to pairs.<br>

                            I'd actually say that more people probably have cards in the house than dice. They're certainly stocked in a lot more stores than even d6s (is my experience in New Zealand; elsewhere may differ). And they're familiar to almost everyone, where dice other than d6s are not.<br><br>And as you say, Morat, there are many different ways to match them up and many types of game to draw on.<br/><br/>Some great ideas coming out here, including several where they aren't randomizers at all but resources to use strategically.
