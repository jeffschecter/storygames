For all I know, there's a Stealth (Psionic) skill as well, to conceal your brainwaves from passing psychics.<br/><br/>[Evergreen] doesn't tell me a goddamn thing; it is completely without meaning in this context.  And even if I knew the context, I'd probably still think it was a poor choice of word, and be irritated by it.  I can be picky about things like that.<br/><br/><br/>Edit:  Upon further reflection, I think I know what it means now.  This is a skill for a game in which the PCs can take on the form of trees.  Stealth (Physical) is the skill used when trying to conceal oneself as an actual, real-life tree (as opposed to a strictly mental tree, sort of an illusionary tree-form).  [Evergreen] denotes that in this case, the character's preferred tree-form is an evergreen...a bonus when in, say, a stand of fir, but a serious drawback when you're trying to conceal yourself among the maples.  If the rest of the game were as gleefully nonsensical and surreal as this, I could be very interested in it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85463/#Comment_85463" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-03T20:19:37+00:00" title="August  3, 2007  8:19PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My immediate response:<br/>- Stealth, cool.
