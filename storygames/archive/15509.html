The basic idea is that you make the character just interesting enough to hold the reader's attention, but simple enough that the reader can easily get behind his skull. He has to know little or nothing about the events that are happening (they'll all be revealed to him by other characters, so he learns about his world at the same time as the reader), and strong opinions on any subject are likely to put off a significant fraction of readers, so you'd usually avoid them. The end result is that when you watch SW, you can visualise *being* Luke much more easily than you can any other character, which involves you in the story and invests you in his stakes much more than riding on the back of somebody harder to sympathise with. Taken together, this means that pretty much by necessity, all the other characters end up having the memorable opinions and revelations to impart."</i><br/><br/>Has this technique ever translated into roleplaying?  Where players deliberately each make a simple protagonist character to root for, but then maybe players also make other non-protagonist NPC characters that reach a bit deeper into theme and premise? Possibly the real meat of the story is told through the NPCs, while the protagonists are not much more than pretty minecarts.<br/><br/>Seems like this happens all the time in video games.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351603/#Comment_351603" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-15T15:44:03+00:00" title="December 15, 2011  3:44PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            See also: Bella.

No need for a generic "everyman" when you can customize everything to your specifications, you know? At least that's how I see it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money" title="Big_J_Money"><img alt="Big_J_Money" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money">Big_J_Money</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351660/#Comment_351660" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-16T09:28:44+00:00" title="December 16, 2011  9:28AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 16, 2011 9:29AM by Big_J_Money.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was thinking more along the lines of a character's ideas and headspace being simple enough that a player doesn't have to feel like they need to analyze their character's position/philosophy/whatever when making decisions with the character.  I mean, I guess some people automatically make characters like this anyway.   <br/><br/>I guess the part I'm more intrigued by is the part where a writer is willing to make thematic or philosophical points through other characters that the "viewer" (read: player) is relating to in a more externalized way.  I'm wondering if there are things that players or even GMs can do with NPCs that can't be done well with PCs for this same reason.<br/><br/>Anyway, this whole comment could have been bullshit.  I'm not a writer, so I wouldn't have a very informed opinion on that <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
