It comes more from my own play experiences, less from theory.<br/><br/>Does it make sense? Do you think this would help you play the game? Or decide not to play it? Is it too long? Thanks.<br/><br/>A note on play styles:<br/><br/>While playing a role-playing game, you and your fellow players, including the GM, will create an imaginary world that you share. It is something like the board in a board game, or the tabletop battle map in a war game, only much more vibrant. That is because instead of creating a visual representation of that world, you will imagine it, together, by describing it\u2014through conversation about the world, through acting out the characters in it, and describing where they are, what they do and say, and sometimes, even what they think and feel. When you describe your characters in action, you will need to place them in context, and to do that, you need to create, expand, or utilize that shared imaginary world, which becomes the setting of your game.<br/><br/>Not all games ask you to imagine that setting in the same way. I don't mean whether it's a fantasy game or a sci-fi game. That's genre. Role-playing is such a vast and flexible medium, there is room to imagine your setting as an <i>environment</i>, or a <i>narrative</i>.<br/><br/>Because role-playing developed out of war games, the original conception of the setting was as an environment. A place, or a location. A virtual environment, actually, before video games introduced them to the world. Players took on the roles of characters in that environment, and moved through it, exploring it. When players imagined events or characters in that setting, they judged them based on <i>how they imagined their setting worked</i>. If they thought that something was not functioning <i>according to the way they thought it should function in that environment</i>, it was not considered fair. It broke the constraints of the game.<br/><br/>Over time, another style developed, that of <i>story</i>. Instead of imagining the setting as an environment, people began to imagine their characters moving through a story. Instead of asking "would that happen in this environment?" they started asking "is that right for this story?" This type of setting allows players to use different play techniques.<br/><br/>Let's take an example. Say you've just been reading a Raymond Chandler novel, and it's got you all excited. You want to play something in Chandler's style! But there's a substantial difference between mid-20th century Los Angeles as a setting, and a Raymond Chandler novel as a setting. You can only play mid-20th century Los Angeles as an environmental setting. What would happen in mid-20th century LA? Who would be there? What kinds of things would the see and do? There is no one story to a city, only the place. To get that Raymond Chandler feel, you have to think of your setting as a story. Since the only things that are appropriate in a Raymond Chandler novel are the things that Raymond Chandler wrote, you have to judge events and characters by whether they are appropriate for those stories, not whether they fit into mid-20th century LA. Chandler's novels may have been set there, but they were not typical examples of what happened in Los Angeles, ever.<br/><br/>Now, if you were to play in mid-20th century LA, you don't necessarily need to have characters from that place and time. You can put a robot or an alien into that setting, still thinking "what would happen to a robot or an alien in mid-20th century LA?" without ever considering why that would be interesting. A story setting tends to bring the players closer together. They have to decide on what kind of story they are playing, and what it means to them, and for their characters. Players have to ask, not only "what would my character do <i>in this situation</i>?" but also "what would my character do <i>in this story</i>? and "is that right for the story?" Naturally, some players will feel this is too much added responsibility, while others will find it easier than maintaining the authenticity needed for a great environmental setting.<br/><br/><i>Flowers in the Fall</i> demands a story setting. There is some leeway here, and of course, you are still expected to create a colourful, immersive world for your characters to inhabit. But the way opposition is structured is meant to give a sense of dramatic momentum, while player characters relate to the GM's supporting cast in ways that are determined by their place in the story, not their place within an environment. Characters are intimately connected with the setting, because it revolves around them.<br/><br/>Because play is focused on the players' characters, and specifically their struggle against the forces threatening the world they live in, the game plays better when you think in terms of story arcs, scenes, and dramatic tension. The game might not be exactly like your favourite novels, but when you play with them in mind, you can come pretty close.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226958/#Comment_226958" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-23T17:09:23+00:00" title="August 23, 2009  5:09PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When probing for mines, it's generally best to use a non-ferromagnetic implement, such as a sturdy branch or aluminum tent pole.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226960/#Comment_226960" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-23T17:27:21+00:00" title="August 23, 2009  5:27PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Its is both too long, and seems arbitrary (not that this particular compleignt is solely yours, most of these attempt at (rpg)  taxinomys seem arbitrary because its literally being imposed from the top (that's where you, god, and the game designer live)). The second last paragraph seems particularly confusing to me, (yeah i get you are trying to say you are making a story and not a playbox type game, but when you say things like 'relate to the gm's supporting cast in ways that are determined by their place in the story, not their place within an environment' it sounds really weird to my ears.  <br/><br/>If I were you and trying to communicate this to others, I would really stay away from making a new division of things that seperate the way we are surposed to play and the way we are not surposed to play. First of all, its just one more thing to learn for a new player THAT THEY MAY OR MAY NOT USE, honestly if I play your game and I'm all in the environment really what's it to you. Either it will work or it wont and the game (not the players) will be judged accordingly. Secondly things that stick arround (like genre concepts or even *shudder* big modelism/GNS/whatever a person in the know will enivtibly say i should have read a 6 year old blog to find out the appropiate name of) stick arround because they work. People can get that bruce willis may not need to reload or act like he has been hurt when he's smashing nazi's with two fists without having to wrap their mind arround, "Bruce willis is interacting with the story and not the environment becuase the environment would mean that he would be dead from a punctured spleen and a severe lack of bullets" . <br/><br/>Hope that helps,. <br/><br/>PS why am i surposed to create a colourful immersive environment when I am surposed to be making a story or some such, wouldn't the aim be to make a colourful immersive story. i mean really if you  want to say fuck the environment you have to say fuck the environment or I am going to be 10 kinds of confused.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226961/#Comment_226961" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-23T17:45:46+00:00" title="August 23, 2009  5:45PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Colin: Any suggestions on how to get a longer pole?<br/><br/>Logos7: Cool, thanks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226962/#Comment_226962" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-23T17:50:05+00:00" title="August 23, 2009  5:50PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2009 5:50PM by Graham.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Does it make sense?

You've combined the <i>What is Roleplaying?</i> section with some game theory/playstyle information, and it seems to be presented as if to people entirely new to roleplaying.  If it's intended for newcomers, they don't need to know about other styles of play, they just need instructions on how to play this particular game.  Adding descriptions of other ways to play just confuses things.  If the text is intended for experienced gamers, they don't need explanations of roleplaying, but they do need to be told, clearly and directly, that your game won't work well with traditional, character-centered play.<br/><br/>For either audience, you've cluttered the explanation with unnecessary information.<br/><br/>To answer your questions directly:<br/><br/>It makes sense, but it is not particularly clear.<br/><br/>I don't think it would help me to play your game if I didn't already know the difference between traditional roleplay and story-oriented roleplay.<br/><br/>It is too long.
