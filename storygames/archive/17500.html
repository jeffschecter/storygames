If so, how was it? What did you do?<br/><br/>I was there as a guest. I participated in three focus groups, was on four panels, gave a solo talk, and ran three playtests of two live-action things I am working on. Metatopia is pretty interesting. The idea of focus groups - one or two hour session s not about playing but about addressing a specific problem - is really productive and cool.<br/><br/>Here are two of the panels I was on:<br/><br/><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3441990/metatopia_obscure_and_influential.mp3" rel="nofollow">Obscure and Influential</a><br/><br/><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3441990/metatopia_2012_beautiful_failures.mp3" rel="nofollow">Beautiful Failures</a><br/><br/>And my talk:<br/><br/><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3441990/metatopia_2012_gmless.mp3" rel="nofollow">Authority and GMless games</a><br/><br/>How about you?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rocha" title="Rocha"><img alt="Rocha" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/845/nFFQGXD7T2DFH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rocha">Rocha</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396719/#Comment_396719" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-07T12:03:50+00:00" title="November  7, 2012 12:03PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Jason, can you talk a bit more about these focus groups - how they work, how many people participated, the kind of problems they adressed and such...<br/><br/>We're planning a small game design convention here in Brasil for 2013, and metatopia it's a kinda of a huge inspiration for us!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396721/#Comment_396721" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-07T12:08:55+00:00" title="November  7, 2012 12:08PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 7, 2012 12:09PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Rocha,<br/><br/>I didn't organize them but I understand that designers could request a focus group (and perhaps even ask for specific people, or specific sorts of people, to attend). <br/><br/>I was in one that was all about game mechanics, and one that was about marketing, and one that was about re-purposing old game mechanics, and one that was about evoking a particular experience in play. Each designer came with a specific question. Three of them were one hour long and one was two hours long. I think they are a very productive adjunct to playtesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396726/#Comment_396726" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-07T12:36:05+00:00" title="November  7, 2012 12:36PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a really good time.<br/><br/>I ran 14 hours of 13th Age over six sessions (four 2-hour sessions, one 4-hour session, and one 4-hour session at the end that we made a 2-hour session).  I accumulated a decent amount of playtest feedback to give Rob Heinsoo, especially about the damned sorcerer class.<br/><br/>My game time was all GMing, no playing. This was just fine.<br/><br/>I attended a handful of panels. I am sad to have missed An Hour with Ken Hite, but I did make it to An Hour with Jason Morningstar. Also went to the Editing panel and the History panel. <br/><br/>This con more than any other before, I socialized. It was fantastic to just sit down and chat with people for hours. I met new, amazing people (folks, add me on whatever social network you're on!).<br/><br/>I traded lots of little pieces of green paper for lots of new, shiny games. Too many. I let John Stavropoulos talk me into buying two additional games not on my list, but I know for sure I won't regret owning Monsterhearts. <br/><br/>Why can't I do this every weekend?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396731/#Comment_396731" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-07T13:10:46+00:00" title="November  7, 2012  1:10PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (slightly edited down from my G+ post)<br/><br/>Metatopia...<br/><br/>...exceeded my expectation. I think I didn't realize how much I missed seeing my con-going game friends, so I was doing a lot of catching up with people I haven't seen in the flesh for 3-4 years. It was really, really good for the soul. Also, I made some new friends, which is always my favorite part of cons! <br/><br/>Additionally, my playtests were very productive! Imp of the Perverse has real legs, (and a lot of room for improvement). I had two great groups of strangers who came to it totally cold, and we had fun monster-slaying times (including one guy for whom it was his first RPG session ever!!)<br/><br/>World Wide Wrestling was amazingly fun, and at least 10% of it came from the actual game (the other 90% being the players, natch)<br/><br/>This Match is Scheduled For One Fall was, as a player put it, "a charming failure". I think it's destined for the shelf, but I'm pretty sure I learned something.<br/><br/>Also, on Friday I got to play Seth Ben-Ezra 's Dirty Secrets. The game (session) was fun, the game (design) was ahead-of-its-time and totally inspirational, it was a great group to play with, and a great warm-up/segue into the weekend.<br/><br/>I was on 4 panels (three that I got scheduled onto, 1 that I asked to be added to). My panels were really interesting. I didn't really know what to expect. The "obscure games" panel was fun to do, though a little hectic with 7 panelists (and suffered from RPG-bias, as poor James Ernest (sp)? didn't really have much space to get in edge-wise). The "Should I Self-Publish" panel was also fun to do, as I got to make a case for the (few) benefits of self-publishing, but I don't know how much actual take-away value there was for the audience.<br/><br/>My Sunday morning panel, Layout and Graphic Design, went really well! Between the panelists we had a good spread of experience in different spheres of the field, and I made sure that we polled the audience for specific talking points, which was really constructive. I came away feeling like we helped orient some people toward how to get started with approaching doing layout themselves, and/or how to interact with hiring freelancers. And I think we had a good panelist rapport and rhythm - I know I learned something myself from the other guys! So that was great.<br/><br/>The last panel, Art for Non-Artists, was the second-to-last panel of the convention, I think, and totally suffered from low energy on both the panelist's and the audience's part. But we got to talk about how to get imagery in your book without being an artist or breaking the bank, and I think there were some concrete resources that came out that will be helpful to folks.<br/><br/>One concrete suggestion for improvement: have designers indicate in their event descriptions what stage of playtesting they're in. I personally would go for a split like "First Testing Stage/Development Stage/Polishing Stage". Especially for early playtests, the games probably don't need as long of slots, and also it would help orient players who are signing up for events day-off orient themselves towards the kind of experience they want to be a part of.<br/><br/>TL:DR: A+++ would con again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396767/#Comment_396767" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-07T15:46:40+00:00" title="November  7, 2012  3:46PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I expected Metatopia to be like a stand-alone version of Dreamation's Indie Games Explosion, but with the offerings limited to playtests.   <br/>I thought the designers would be either Forge/Story-Games folks, or self-taught lone wolves, making games alone out in the diffuse rpg wilderness... <br/><br/>I saw those things I expected, <br/>but my tunnel-vision was expanded thanks to:<br/><br/>1. board game designers, and getting a peek at their scene (I know they're well-networked, but I don't usually cross paths with 'em.)<br/>2. larp organizers -- whose body of theory (formalized AND folk-wisdom) makes the Forge Provisional Glossary look like child's play (to my surprise).<br/>3. retail, in the form of Jim Crocker<br/>4. freelancers, like Amanda Valentine (as opposed to self-published indie solo-acts.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396769/#Comment_396769" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-07T15:51:05+00:00" title="November  7, 2012  3:51PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yah, the combo of indie solo-acts and integrated-with-larger-publisher-folks (like Hal Mangold, Cam Banks, Darren Watts) and freelance specialist-y folks (like Amanda and Ken Hite) seemed pretty solid to me.<br/><br/>I'm scared of doing board-game playtests, they seem so organized!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396785/#Comment_396785" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-07T17:06:48+00:00" title="November  7, 2012  5:06PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 7, 2012 5:07PM by J_Walton.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Were the board gamers doing "real" product testing, as opposed to the stuff we typically do?

The other two Double Exposure shows did very well for us this year, but given the lower attendance and highly-focused nature of this, I wasn't sure how business would go.<br/><br/>It turned out the answer was : pretty damn good! I had a really fun time, with folks coming by to check out the booth and chat from right when I started (I needed to set up my Square before I was even done unboxing) to the moment I left (it was the last thing I packed up!). Several attendees had kind words for my presentation and selection, which was great. I spoke on a couple of panels, for publishers interested in getting into the traditional retail channel, about what (some) hobby retailers look for when we buy.<br/><br/>I didn't get to play any games at all, which was mildly disappointing, but since it was because people were constantly handing me their credit cards I can't really get too worked up about it.  Getting to see all my occasional gamer friends and make a few new ones was really the point anyway. I'll definitely set up again next year assuming VnA would like us back.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
