Meanwhile, the city guard is investigating the chemists of Sprucetuck for a lack of scent provided for the scent border (which is actually the result of Clove, the tenderpaw, trying to make her rival Autumn look bad). The murder investigation seems to point to a chemist being involved. The patrol finds the damning evidence a bit too convenient. Through casting a wider net, they discover that Matis' son Norbert (a politically ambitious mouse) paid a runner to plant evidence. Upon confronting him (and the ensuing hanggliding chase through the spiral of Sprucetuck) the patrol brings him to justice and learns that Norbert had discovered that Matis was working with a ferret spy to obtain weasel musk for his super powerful scent formula. Norbert, worried about his political career, confronted his father and things got out of hand and he accidentally pushed him from the top of the Sprucetuck spiral. The head of the town guard, Leland, congratulates them on a job well done. <br/><br/>Also, through some really good deceit rolls on the part of the surprisingly petty Clove, Autumn is demoted for her malfeasance.

My poison of choice is the Holmes edition and I ran a dungeon I'd constructed myself with some creative input from kesher over at the <a href="http://www.odd74.proboards.com" rel="nofollow">OD&amp;D74 boards</a>. I learned a lot, and had great fun! Best single part of the night might have been the look on the face of the guy whose character was the first to die (three were killed!) when I told him he had to tear up the character sheet, but it wasn't. Best single part of the evening was that in the end I had more happy players leaving the table than I started with. And, the guy who was first to tear up his sheet (and got his second character killed as well) said he'd definitely play old school D&amp;D again if offered.<br/><br/>Story wise? The usual stuff.
