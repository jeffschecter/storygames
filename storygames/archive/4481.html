I've got some new additions to the menu.  <br/><br/>First off, and always, more <a href="http://www.fullmotorproductions.com" rel="nofollow">Criminal Element: A Game of Desperate Deeds</a>.  I came up with a new Trust and Betrayal mechanic that works like a champ in my head, but I need to get a playtest of it.  Also have some clarified Advantage rules that cleans up a lot of the text, so need to give those a pass, too.  <br/><br/>Got Reign in the mail last week and I really like it.  I don't feel like I'll be able to understand the scope of the Company rules until I actually run a game of it, though, so that goes on the menu as well.  <br/><br/>I've had a hankering for some Tribe 8 lately, as well.  The problem is that I don't really care for the silhouette system.  The resolution for this, of course, is to use Shadow of Yesterday for the rules set and just port over the setting, make some new Secrets, and bring over the funky magick rules.  That's probably going to be sometime in November.  <br/><br/>Beyond that I'm still looking to get back to some Sorcerer.  My last game fell apart under the weight of time, so I'm just itching to get back to running something Sorcerer-y.  <br/><br/>Finally, I simply must play Sons of Liberty.  Must.  I live in Philadelphia, grew up in New Jersey, and need to kick ass with clockwork mecha.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101480/#Comment_101480" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-07T01:03:05+00:00" title="October  7, 2007  1:03AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I  want to play more of Perfect.

I'm thinking highly visual stuff (Bourne action stunts) mixed with team interaction and some special props (Mission: Impossible, the TV show). System? I have no idea and I'm seriously considering designing one, for the first time in English.<br/><br/>2-A friend of mine had us play The Mountain Witch a while back. It wasn't conclusive but three of us are nonetheless very intrigued by the clean mechanics. Recently, I threw an idea in the air. I'd run the thing myself. The twist would be that each character is/was tied passionately with the witch. Possible connections (to be chosen or drawn randomly) would include:<br/><br/>A The Witch's first love<br/>B The Witch's legal spouse<br/>C The Witch's current lover<br/>D The person who was dumped for the witch's current lover<br/>E A relative of the witch, once involved in an incestuous affair, or they at least considered it<br/>F A person madly in love with the witch, but rejected<br/><br/>and so on, the possibilities are limitless. I'd tie these to Fates and Zodiacs in some way. The idea is to make the Witch an out-of-control, destroying force that is way too badass to be taken out, unless by people who are very close. But will the characters be able to cooperate when there are former rivalries there and when some of them are still madly in love? <br/><br/>3-Finally, I really dig Judd's Githyanki vibe and I'm still thinking about mixing them up in Everway. They'd be Spherewalkers. I'm slowly tying up a story but haven't found an idea for the silver swords yet. <br/><br/>Idea 3 is definitly going to happen. I'm focusing on idea 1 and giving myself a week to come up with a promising seed of a game. I'll give idea 2 a try but I'm a little intimidated by it. Need to prep carefully.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
