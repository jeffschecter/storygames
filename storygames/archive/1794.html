                    I found this snippet from an interview with BSG staff writer Anne Cofell Saunders in a recent Creative Screenwriting Weekly email amusing.
<blockquote><b>What is your favorite part of your job?</b><br/><br/>In many ways I'm going to work on the Battlestar Galactica every day. I know that's kind of silly, but in truth, I spend a lot of time with these characters and what they know and what they believe and what they would do in that universe, and you grow to love them.<br/><br/>It's sort of like getting to play Dungeons and Dragons all day. I used to play D&amp;D in high school, and you get to put together these worlds. Ron has created this great world, and you get to play with the characters in the world. You have hour-long conversations in the writers' room over what Starbuck [Katee Sackhoff] would or wouldn't do. It's really fun! I also don't have to deal with any actual death. The stakes are high because it's Hollywood, but nobody going to die on my operating table. </blockquote>

                            I swear the writers just play Primetime Adventures and transcribe the AP report to the script.                        </div>

                            You know David Cronenberg's eXistenZ,<br/>
where the actors pretend to be virtual reality video game avatars,<br/>
complete with bugs in the program?<br/>
<br/>
I watched The Spanish Prisoner last night, and it's practically<br/>
a parody of a Primetime Adventures play transcript.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(SPOILER)<br/>
<br/>
There's a flat quality to the acting, as if the actors understand<br/>
'this is the scene where we show _________", but they're<br/>
hesitantly improvising the details on the fly.<br/>
<br/>
It's easy to visualize the character sheets of all the characters,<br/>
with their signature quirks and their pithy secrets.<br/>
<br/>
The 'thriller' genre conventions hang over the picture like<br/>
a cloud of "well, we said we're playing a thriller tonight,<br/>
what does that mean, exactly?"/ punctuated by spurts<br/>
of THIS IS A THRILLER moments where some player<br/>
gets a hot idea and really lays it on a bit too thick.<br/>
<br/>
Then, at the end, the thing picks up momentum and<br/>
it's like the players got carried away/ got drunk<br/>
on showing off their nutty indie creativity/ and<br/>
the layers of intrigue get waaaaaaay too tricksy.<br/>
<br/>
Then, exhausted by the effort of the session, the<br/>
players get groggy and slaphappy and childish<br/>
and somebody ends the session by geeking-out<br/>
and having a freaking JAPANESE SCHOOLGIRL<br/>
WITH A GIANT RIFLE appears out of nowhere<br/>
and save the day.<br/>
<br/>
Literally.  That's literally how it ends.<br/>
<br/>
I do recommend The Spanish Prisoner.<br/>
But mostly I'd only recommend it to indie gamers.                        </div>

                            (SPOILER ALERT)<br><br>For what it's worth, I'd note that 1) she did appear earlier in the movie, in a "red flag" scene, and 2) the performance of the actors was standard for a Mamet film.  Same goes for Glengarry Glen Ross or Spartan or the episodes of the Unit that Mamet wrote and/or directed.  That's just his style.<br><br>BTW, you might want to toss a spoiler warning up there, for those who haven't seen The Spanish Prisoner yet.<br><br>-- Rafael                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

The strangely spaced line breaks and occasional odd punctuation make this post read like a poem.                        </div>
