You should maybe Google it if you have no idea what I'm talking about and want to check out this thread.<br/><br/>So there was once this badass order called the Amyr. They did what had to be done. They burned villages, killed priests, and boiled kittens if it served the greater good (in this case, the Greater Good, a specific philosophy (I think)). Once an Amyr knight was inducted into the Order and got his tattoos (they have wicked tattoos on their hands), his word was law. If an Amyr wanted to rape and pillage and destroy, they didn't have to justify their actions. It was trusted that whatever an Amyr knight did was in the interest of the Greater Good. Kind of (read: exactly) like The Order Set Apart to the Preservation of the Faith of the King of Life (I think I got the name right, going from memory here).<br/><br/>Anyway, at the time the story of the novels takes place, the Amyr have all but disappeared. The historical records about them are uneven, contradictory, and hard to come by. Almost as if they were pruning themselves from history! The novels have a big bad band of bad guys, who pretty much everyone is afraid of, from the wisest king to the fiercest warrior to the mightiest Faen creature (well, save one Faenling perhaps). The Amyr are not afraid of these guys; the big bad guys are afraid of the Amyr.<br/><br/>So this is the thread where I'll talk about it, before and after. Right now, we're at the before stage! So, Dogs veterans, would you be so kind as to give me your advice? What needs hacking, and what doesn't (generally speaking). Can I just use the book as written and write a cheat sheet of useful information about the Amyr-analogue I'm interested in presenting? They have magic, I think, so the supernatural scale is fine as written. I dunno. Shoot me some advice! If you would be so kind.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://blog.patrickrothfuss.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Amyr.jpg"/><br/>ETA: yeaaaaaaaaah                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316550/#Comment_316550" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-14T09:39:41+00:00" title="March 14, 2011  9:39AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Will people in the villages know who the Amyr are?

Part of what sets guns apart in that version is that they come with that pesky 1d4. That may or may not be appropriate to transfer to swords. But the point is, when the killin' tools come out, people die.</p>\n<p>In the case of the second, there's a specific list of elements of ceremony and what they push the fallout dice up to. Adjust as need be, sit back and enjoy the scenery. I don't know the setting of the books, so I can't suggest things there, but I can say you need to adapt that scale.</p>\n<p>(Though, you make me want to read the books now.

I think that the government (in the form of a monolithic Empire) oppresses the people and causes widespread harm, and the Amyr act from the shadows to combat this. The people know of them, they trust them as symbols of the Greater Good, but they aren't common or organized under any national banner. The towns themselves don't send people to become Amyr--people are sought out in secret and trained as knights.<br/><br/>Weapons in general will be hard to come by I think. Something like a knife will be relatively common, but it will be more like a woodsman's knife than a dagger. Maybe if one has a license to hunt they can own a short bow, but other than that the populace is supposed to be completely unarmed. Crossbows are wildly illegal and so on and so forth. Magic is seen with equal parts awe and terror, and the laws regarding it are twisted and uncertain. In one town a man could be lynched for being too good at playing a lute, while in another town perhaps they permit minor tricks like magical fire or light. I think there will be an Imperial Magistrate to take the place of the Steward in Dogs. He's supposed to keep the town safe, but the Empire is corrupt and many Magistrate are corrupt along with it. This is where the Amyr come in.<br/><br/>I'll respond more later. Thoughts? Also, thanks for your replies!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chroma" title="Chroma"><img alt="Chroma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/n1N2ZVK30JJ00.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chroma">Chroma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316591/#Comment_316591" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-14T13:57:33+00:00" title="March 14, 2011  1:57PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What is the demonic influence/demons analogue in this world?  <br/><br/>What is it that wants people to "do evil" that the Amyr will be rooting around for?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GregPogor" title="GregPogor"><img alt="GregPogor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_e5387V2_bKU/TVEgYJ8ZWtI/AAAAAAAAAcw/CFb4Akfg5SE/avatar_storygame_small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GregPogor">GregPogor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316669/#Comment_316669" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-15T05:43:20+00:00" title="March 15, 2011  5:43AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How do the Amyr define the Greater Good ?
