The formal for the number of hexes you can travle by jetpack based on the planetary conditions, gravity, and your jetpack skill included a square root. That's the only square root I've ever seen in an RPG.<br/><br/>The game also had a wild matrix where your environmental survival skill was written in a box on a chart that looked sort of like the inside of a slightly defomred crossword puzzle. You wrote your skill in the square corresponding the environment of the world you were born on (say, arctic tundra, or temperate forest). The numbers then decreased as they spiralled outward giving your effective skill an any terrain. If your home terrain was space station, zero G, which was in a sort of curlicue off the top of the chart, then you ability to survive in, for example, an equatorial jungle on the lower right, would almost certainly be a negative number.<br/><br/>I have not yet seen an RPG that uses imaginary numbers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184984/#Comment_184984" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-26T21:19:49+00:00" title="December 26, 2008  9:19PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tony dowler</cite>That's the only square root I've ever seen in an RPG.</blockquote>\nI'm pretty sure vehicle design in both GURPS and Traveller involved many cube and square roots in various formulae.

The main reason being that you had to enchant a focus as part of pre-play background, and doing so involved collecting various materials determined by the PC's birth sign, which each had their own innate magical resistance that needed to be overcome in the focus-building process. So, you'd know that you had X hundred days of pre-play life to account for, and you could enchant a given amount of each kind of material per day depending on your level, and you were continuously leveling up during those X hundred days, so your speed of enchantment would <i>increase</i> as the X hundred days wore on, meaning that the time it took to enchant each type of material varied over the course of the pre-play period... so you'd have to sort of map out how many days the PC spent at each level to see how much enchanting was occurring during those period so you could see if you had your focus done by the time play began.<br/><br/>Basically, a lot of needless insanity just to say, "My wizard begins the game with a magic wand that actually lets him use his class powers."<br/><br/>Also, I have dim memories of FGU's other number cruncher, <i>Space Opera</i>, *requiring* Trig in order to handle 3D spaceship combat. And chargen, of course, had lots of multiplying by decimals and such.<br/><br/>Otherwise... I'd say that HERO certainly gets pretty intense. I can't see ever making PCs without the Hero Designer software (which is actually one of the better chargen apps out there, for any system). And doing division at the table to figure out Move Bys and Move Throughs was always fun... as was trying to figure out how to add damage to attacks (which takes up *four pages* in the current rulebook).<br/><br/>I know it's not nice to condemn other people's fun, but damn... I'd like to think we know better nowadays. My affection for HERO will probably never die, but I really don't see the point of these kinds of RPGs anymore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185068/#Comment_185068" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-27T19:40:36+00:00" title="December 27, 2008  7:40PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There was a moment of truth for me when, during the playtest of GURPS Vehicles, there was a strenuous argument about the amount of power in kilowatt-hours generated by a particular variant Bf-109 engine.

I don't remember rolling for each node, but the chart itself I thought was very cool, showing how the wizards of Aysle saw the world as working.  I also liked that the limited number of paths "forced" some kinds of spells to go certain ways.  For example, transmutation required True Knowledge... but the only way to work that in, if you were transmuting something from a living form to an unliving material, was through Darkness.  Another interesting addition was in making magic items -- to place a spell in something, you had to incorporate the material of the item in the path.  Thus, to make a wooden wand have a spell in it, you had to incorporate "Wood" into the spell's path.<br/><br/>There was a similar gem in the Orrorsh book for TORG, where the spell creation system for it was laid out.  Most games would have taken the existing spell creation system they had and adapted it.  Instead, TORG's writers created a completely different system from that of Aysle.  Orrorsh's system focused on "Occult Events", which could be broken down into "subevents" using "occult props".  Putting more subevents and props in made the rolls you had to do easier -- but at the same time generated plot for the GM, since the PCs would have to get the props they needed... or the NPC would have to get them.<br/><br/>As I recall, there was yet a third magic system in another of the TORG setting books, but I don't remember which one, or the details.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185115/#Comment_185115" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-28T20:57:10+00:00" title="December 28, 2008  8:57PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: efindel</cite>As I recall, there was yet a third magic system in another of the TORG setting books, but I don't remember which one, or the details.</blockquote>\nThe Nile Empire had its Pyramid/Architecture Magic (which, incidentally, was Fucking Awesome as a concept), but its Pulp Gadget Creation rules ran Very much like the all-encompassing rules of Aysle and Orrorsh.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185186/#Comment_185186" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-29T11:26:24+00:00" title="December 29, 2008 11:26AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://welcometofranksworld.blogspot.com/2005/10/game-system-analysis-cold-iron.html" rel="nofollow">Cold Iron</a> was probably the most math intensive RPG in play that I have regularly played. Every resolution roll involved a lookup on a table that represented the normal distribution. Spell casters used exponential and logarithmic calculations to determine current mana (spell) points. I wrote a program to compute magic item costs using formulas I have developed.<br/><br/>The most intensive math I've ever done for a game was for AD&amp;D. I tried to derive a formula to determine how a fireball expanded to fill a constricted space. To do this, since I had not yet had multiple-integration in calculus yet, I actually managed to derive it for myself. I think I only ever managed to have a workable formula for the fireball to be constrained in one dimension. I could compute the radius of expansion if the fireball was centered in a sufficiently large room that it was only ever constrained by the floor and/or ceiling, given an arbitrary ceiling height and height off the floor of the blast center.<br/><br/>Although the math is simple, GURPS and Hero character generation was certainly annoyingly mathematical. We constantly found we couldn't get the same point total twice from adding up all the individual point costs.<br/><br/>Chivalry and Sorcery (1st edition is all that I actually have experience with) certainly had intensive rules for spells, but I never considered it all that mathematical.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185254/#Comment_185254" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-29T20:18:35+00:00" title="December 29, 2008  8:18PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just had a flashback to a game I once playtested, but I don't think ever got produced. It was a science fiction game with skill lists that went on for pages. Skills were percentile-based, of course, and calculating the build point cost of each percentage point was just a few taps on a calculator. Then, you were given three lumps of build points to buy skills. They totaled 10,000 points...with costs calculated to 2 decimal places effectively making it <i>1,000,000 build points</i>. So, while it wasn't the worst math I'd seen in a game, the sheer scale of it deserves mention.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
