I've posted the AP <a href="http://nerdldn.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?t=37" rel="nofollow">here.</a>. It was interesting for me to run as we ended up with only two players and it really showed me how more is definitely better with this style of game. I could have run it as a GM-less game, but still didn't feel confident enough about the game to do so. With only two players (one of whom had never played Inspectres before and neither having much experience of such player freedom to direct the story) there was a lot of hesitancy and a story which could have been stronger. I also only had a Franchise goal of 6 which was far too few and was eaten up quite quickly by the rolls. I eventually fudged it and made it 10 points which turned out to be the right amount, timing-wise. On the whole, however, we all had a good time and more laughs than come across in the AP and we've created a franchise which has real legs in terms of return play. I'm probably going to do it as a TV series type of format in subsequent one-offs.<br/>John                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
