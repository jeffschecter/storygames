Thanks Joe! Ive already told my regular group of players to put together their mixtapes and get ready. Who else bought a copy in the sale and is excited about playing? <br/><br/>I have a few questions!<br/><br/>How often do you introduce Obstacles? Is it just when you feel like it? It's not every scene is it?<br/><br/>When you're getting people to play it and make mixtapes, do you tell them the significance of the first two tracks the first time out? Or let them play and be excited about finding a good combo?<br/><br/>And for those of you who have played it, what are some of the types of road trips you have been on? Anything weird, supernatural or zany? And what about 'non-car' road trips like train or plane or, I don't know, dirigible trips?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281786/#Comment_281786" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-19T17:43:18+00:00" title="July 19, 2010  5:43PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bullbar</cite>How often do you introduce Obstacles? Is it just when you feel like it? It's not every scene is it?</blockquote>\nI would definitely avoid putting an Obstacle into every scene. Most games I've played have seen 1-5 Obstacles. <br/><br/>The more obstacles there are, the more we learn about the characters through shared adversity - as opposed to self-reflection and inner turmoils. Both are potentially interesting: do we want to learn that Jim is gruff by watching him cuss and grunt at the hissing engine as he tries to fix it, or by cussing and grunting at the other people in the car as they try to convince him that it's a good idea to stop at the upcoming picnic area? Do we want to see Maria under fire when the border guard scrutinizes her fake passport, or when her friends try to get to the bottom of all these fishy stories she tells about her past?<br/><br/>I find stories with lots of Obstacles tend to be a bit more upbeat, madcap and action-y. If you're on the run from the law, or you're chasing a master thief who stole a diamond and you're all security guards who don't want your boss to find out, then your Obstacle count is probably going to sky-rocket. And that's good!<br/><br/>It's when you feel like it + remember to + feel like it fits.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bullbar</cite>When you're getting people to play it and make mixtapes, do you tell them the significance of the first two tracks the first time out? Or let them play and be excited about finding a good combo?</blockquote>\nI tell them if (a.) it's convenient to, (b.) that kind of "meta-gaming" doesn't feel like extra work to them, and (c.) I remember to. So, like, 33% of the time I tell people the significance of the first two tracks. Often, I just say, "the first two tracks are really important, so if you've got some 'big message' to your mix, make it in the first two tracks."<br/><br/>If someone thinks in the GURPS mode of thinking, tell them the mechanical significance of the first two tracks.<br/>If someone obsesses over their music and finding the perfect song for an occasion, tell them about the thematic significance of the first two tracks.<br/>If someone is leery about playing, or has a busy life, no worries.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bullbar</cite>Anything weird, supernatural or zany?</blockquote>\nMost supernatural one for me:<br/>Me, Jackson Tegu and Daniel Wood were road trippers in a post-apocalyptic America, journeying to the zero mark, the actual crater of the big meteorite, the one that decimated the entire mid-west. We were an orphan girl, a widowed author, and a tinkering conspiracy theorist. It was good.<br/><br/>Others have had zanier trips than I, and maybe they'll jump in and talk about 'em.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281819/#Comment_281819" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-19T22:29:27+00:00" title="July 19, 2010 10:29PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 19, 2010 10:30PM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Alternate Track Hack for Perfectionist Mix-Hobbyists.</b> <br/>(Because putting your 'anchor' song first on a mix is just, like, not how a good mix works, damnit!)<br/><br/>1. Make your perfect mix without worrying about the game.<br/>2. When the game starts and your mix is selected, choose any of your tracks to act as the 'first' one.<br/>3. Do the same for the 'second' track.<br/>4. Start the mix from the proper, listen-only beginning when the game starts.<br/><br/>This will have the bonus effect of reincorporating your foundational tracks at some point in the game -- unless of course you detour first. This will of course further emphasize their importance, and possibly prompt people to do dramatic things with their track-based traits. It also means you can use the same mix twice -- choosing different 'first' and 'second' tracks -- to play variations on a similar theme.<br/><br/>(Caveat: This is a pain in the butt if you have an actual tape for your mix.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281822/#Comment_281822" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-19T22:41:08+00:00" title="July 19, 2010 10:41PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite><b>Alternate Track Hack for Perfectionist Mix-Hobbyists.</b><br/><br/>[snip...]<br/><br/>This will have the bonus effect of reincorporating your foundational tracks at some point in the game</blockquote>\nThis is a damn fine little hack.<br/>Why haven't you told me about this idea earlier?<br/><br/>Permission to include in future editions of the game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281881/#Comment_281881" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-20T11:53:32+00:00" title="July 20, 2010 11:53AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fact: Daniel is right.<br/><br/>Fact: Daniel has said this to the various assemblages which have included both Joe and myself in the past, on at least two occasions.<br/><br/>Fact: I am glad that Joe's good demeanour out-stripes his memory at times.<br/><br/>Fact: this is one of those times.<br/><br/>Fact: Joe is right, too \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite>This is a damn fine little hack.</blockquote>\nHuzzah!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281883/#Comment_281883" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-20T11:56:45+00:00" title="July 20, 2010 11:56AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Second post to even split hairs more finely and cleanly:<br/><br/>...not even really so much as a <i>Hack</i> as it is solid foundations of mix-theory.<br/><br/>It's like saying that rolling dice off of your palm is an interesting Hack for Hell for Leather.<br/>I mean, sure, given no other context.<br/><br/>The metaphorical hairs have been shaved to a fine dust!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Huzzah!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
