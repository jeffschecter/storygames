The first time I ran it we started from scratch and it didn't go as well as I would have hoped, even though early matches are more mechanically interesting than later matches.  Later matches get progressively cooler because of the meaning you've invested in victory or defeat.  I'd try to strike that balance for a one-shot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
