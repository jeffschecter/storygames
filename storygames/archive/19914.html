Each PC can level up a maximum of once per session, whenever they want (maybe not in the middle of a fight or whatever). The idea is to make that not *entirely* a good thing\u2014it increases your raw power, which you need, but it also puts more of what you care about at risk, say.<br/><br/>So, each session, the GM's challenge budget will increase\u2014and you as PCs will (eventually!) need those higher-level abilities to defeat them. And defeat = plot consequences + permanent damage of a sort leveling up won't help (stat damage, say), so you really don't want to get defeated. But leveling up means that the things you care about are in more danger\u2014in other words, the GM's challenge budget increases session-by-session, no matter what, but the kinds of things he can throw his monsters at is dependent on the PCs' level. Oh and you are forced to level up if you haven't already that session.<br/><br/>Say it's a level 1-11 game. Maybe each PC chooses two "anchors," like a person and a place. Grandma and the Grande Old Inn, maybe. Each of them starts out with 5 points of plot armor. Every time a PC levels up, he chooses one of his anchors to lose a point of plot armor<br/><br/>5 points = no harm may come to this Anchor<br/>4 points = Anchor may be physically attacked, but will suffer superficial damage at worst<br/>3 points = Anchor may be kidnapped (person) or invaded (place)<br/>2 points = Anchor may be maimed or permanently disfigured<br/>1 point = Anchor may be turned against the PC in some way<br/>0 points = Anchor may be killed<br/><br/>If any Anchor *is* destroyed, game over, GM wins.<br/><br/>Thoughts? <br/><br/>One thing I think might work well is to have all this stuff be tied to the in-game mythology, so there's less meta-gaming / immersion-breaking.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Patrick_L" title="Patrick_L"><img alt="Patrick_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/999/nLXZTS67FSGIK.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Patrick_L">Patrick_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440853/#Comment_440853" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-12T13:23:31+00:00" title="December 12, 2014  1:23PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it is an interesting concept to put leveling in the hands of the player, but I personally am not too keen on the anchor system.

Why would a character try to protect something or someone with a 4 plot-armor score, if the worst that can come to it is "superficial damage"?<br/>A different take on Patrick's idea for luck: higher levels mean better stat, but lower "luck" - or make luck a stat/bonus that can only decrease over time, with the usage, and that you also use as currency to level up.<br/><br/>But I think you have 2 ideas here, that might be worth exploring from a different angle: the plot anchors and the leveling up. The anchors are possibly more interesting for your story, so make them the core of this possible new system. As you progress in the game, the anchors are threatened, damaged, taken away, permanently damaged, turned against the character and so on... as you described. As for the leveling up - does it need to be about the characters' stats? <br/>Why not about a symmetrical, plot element?<br/>i.e. the GM threatens the anchor; the player has a chance against a minor enemy. The GM has a shot at inflicting a permanent damage - and the player obtains the possibility to gather some info about how to defeat his major enemy... and so on...<br/><br/>As an example: the GM threatens the native village of a character, while giving him the opportunity to fight and defeat an officer of the enemy army; the village is attacked and the small friendly castle destroyed, but the character now knows that the evil Sorcerer can be killed only with the infamous Sword Of Whatever, etc. <br/>Well, don't make it too symmetrical, though...<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440855/#Comment_440855" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-12T13:56:12+00:00" title="December 12, 2014  1:56PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            good thoughts, thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Faulk" title="Mike Faulk"><img alt="Mike Faulk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Faulk">Mike Faulk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440858/#Comment_440858" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-12T15:42:37+00:00" title="December 12, 2014  3:42PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>David</b>: If I level up once and every day someone comes over to my character's house and slaps her Plot Anchor Grandmother because of it, why WOULDN'T she try protect her Gram-jam? <br/><br/><b>Deliverator</b>: It may be interesting if every time you level, you add a plot anchor.

That's an interesting concept and it really hits home that "With great power come great responsibility"<br/><br/>I feel that the anchors should be the players choice though, a player can say "I take the well being of this person/place or thing under my protection" This would give the character an increase in power, but also give them another responsibility.<br/><br/>You could hit this point further by saying that if the player fails to protect the anchor, they lose their bonus, if the anchor is destroyed/killed they get a negative bonus.<br/><br/>E.g<br/><br/>I take the Mage's Guild under my protection, giving me +1 Intelligence. If the if the Mage's Guild is in danger and I do not help them, I lose my bonus [but the guild is still ok]. If I fail to protect it a second time the guild is lost/destroyed and I get -1 Intelligence.<br/><br/>This could lead to a lot of impactful player choices. Both A and B are in danger, can I save them both, or do I focus my efforts on one.<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>A bit of a side note with this idea, I have a really neat thematic Idea for it.<br/><br/>Players are some form of sacred protector who get their power from oaths. Their word is their law. When a player makes an oath they are able to strengthen their character in any way they choose (more skills, powers, stats ect). <br/><br/>You may also want to consider some form of limiter on how many [how often] oaths a player can generate, just to keep things balanced.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440870/#Comment_440870" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-12T21:55:02+00:00" title="December 12, 2014  9:55PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it is a lot about what type of game you want to play.

I think that's precisely because of this unanswered question.)<br/><br/>Implementation-wise, though, I love Patrick_L's idea of "anchoring" each new character ability to some tangible element in the game world which can then be threatened (and thereby harm the character, either removing the ability, or maybe even taking them further down).<br/><br/>Kind of like an ante: I pledge to protect the Temple of Apollo, which grants me with +5 Archery of Doom skills.

You get X powers/points/helpers/whatever. You can keep using them until you run out... or you can level up to get a different or more powerful resource, but when you do so, you lose any remainder of that first resource.<br/><br/>Kind of like this:<br/><br/>Here are 20 $1 bills. Spend them whenever you like!<br/><br/>At any time, you can give me all of your remaining $1 bills to upgrade to level 2: now I give you 20 $10 bills.<br/><br/>At any time, you can give me all of your remaining $10 bills to upgrade to level 3: now I give you 10 $100 bills.<br/><br/>(Especially good if you can't get change - when you use one of your bills, any remainder is lost. So you'd better buy as many hot dogs as you can at level 1, because at level 3 all you have is $100 bills, and you can still buy a hot dog if you want, but you have to use a whole $100 bill to do it.<br/><br/>This encourages you to wait as long as possible before "leveling up", since you'll get the most total benefit by spending enough time at each level to use up all the resources granted.<br/><br/>A simple D&amp;D application:<br/><br/>* As a spell-caster, you get the [usual number of spells for your level]. You may cast each spell once. Once they're gone, they're gone (you can't rememorize them).<br/><br/>* Whenever you wish, you can level up. That erases all the spells you had memorized, and replaces them with the spells of a 2nd-level caster.<br/><br/>Doing this with hit points for a fighter is potentially interesting: you've got to get to the end of the dungeon alive, so how often do you want to "level up" and get more hit points? Play it safe and level up every time you're hurt and you might not make it to the end.

That sounds exactly what I'm looking for here. Thanks!<br/><br/>As for the broader question of what the overall goal of this design is, I agree it needs to be answered more definitively before more progress can be made.<br/><br/>I think I'm basically aiming for emotionally impactful Gamism here. So the challenge is really the primary thing. Like in most such games, the players can leverage their resources and/or special moves to beat those challenges, and leveling up would be one of those special moves. An ancillary benefit here, but an important one, is reducing burden on the GM to adjudicate XP awards and that aspect of pacing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440929/#Comment_440929" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-16T05:16:53+00:00" title="December 16, 2014  5:16AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this is a great idea. Actually there've been several times over the last few years in D&amp;D3 et seq that I've just said "Yeah, you seem to be having trouble, why don't you take another level?"  or said "Are you guys bored doing this stuff? We could skip ahead you could all be 11th level or something..."  A mathematically derived character effectiveness level delivered in customizable chunks (they were less so in prior editions) is a really cool mechanic. I feel like there's a lot that could be done with it that hasn't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440930/#Comment_440930" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-16T05:32:25+00:00" title="December 16, 2014  5:32AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I almost forgot to mention the example I always mention when this kind of thing comes up: The True20 game Arthur Lives! in which the characters are reincarnations of Arthurian myths. The idea being that "levelling up" is the characters remembering abilities and experiences from their prior incarnations.  Unfortunately it didn't do a whole lot with this, sticking to the standard "challenge" methods of levelling up, which seems like it might be better, in this case, to be replaced with almost an achievement system.  "Level up when you do 3 of these 5 things: meet another reincarnation, battle an evil reincarnation, etc."  Or, as you put it, a dramatic system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
