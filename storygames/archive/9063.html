Then they say "how can we get there?", and set up processes leading directly towards the goal. "We need to draw a plan of the house", "we need to hire server programmers".<br/><br/>Now, if I understand fruitful void correctly, <a>it's about setting up procedural elements that aren't explicitly about the focus of the game</a>, in such a way that the focus emerges during play. I don't understand it fully - perhaps I'm looking at it from the wrong angle, or perhaps I need to think more (or less) about it.<br/><br/>How could this principle be applied to work processes? Let's say that I want to set up a workplace that produces great houses. What might the procedural elements be?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200304/#Comment_200304" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-03T02:18:07+00:00" title="April  3, 2009  2:18AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think your quest might be fruitless.

Some will start from some artistics concept and see whether they can build it, some will start with the properties of materials and find out what you can build with them. Some will throw stuff together and see what they get.<br/><br/>Some people's fruitful void is fruitless to others.

For instance, in my generic LARP system GLASS, I wanted a system that was good for simulating conflicts and situations which are too dangerous or expensive to actually DO, then left everything else up to the players and their acting and the organizers and their planning.<br/><br/>You can't actually DO full-contact combat, or DO actual wounding, or DO a lot of prop-heavy situations, so there's rules for it. Is the Point of Play in a GLASS LARP (or any LARP) to put the system through it's paces? No. (I'm not speaking to pure-battle games with almost no plot or even "roles" other than "combatant.") The PoP is to act in character, scheme and backstab, explore, entertain, and ultimately be a part of some kind of story. But there's nothing in GLASS that "does story"--that's emergent from play; and all GLASS provides is a way to safely fight, to simulate magic or supernatural effects (or high tech or whatever), to simulate expensive props or settings that the organizers can't afford to make or buy or build, and to receive some sort of reward cycle (not always! but usually) to enable further options for one's abilities or to provide increased survivability.<br/><br/>Thus, the fruitful void, for GLASS, is everything the system doesn't provide but which should emerge from play as the elements of the system ARE engaged; e.g., someone being "hurt" or even "killed" in the system will definitely have a narrative impact... but there's no "story currency" exchanged to enable or permit that impact.<br/><br/>Umm.... does this jibe with what you're looking for? To use the house analogy--if you build in a lot of windows and skylights, it will make a better studio space. Did you "make a studio," or was that emergent from the design which provided a lot of natural light? Meanwhile, the photographer is going to be a bit nonplussed, because all those windows make his dark room aspiration that much harder. Did you design a house to offend the sensibilities of home-developing photographers, or was it (again) emergent?<br/><br/>This is starting to make me think of the Aristotelian Four Causes--I bet we can put them into game design context:<br/>Material Cause (what) - The RPG is paper and ink, sometimes also cardstock and plastic.<br/>Efficient Cause (how) - The RPG designer writes and lays out the work.<br/>--Those are just dull, mechanical causes.<br/><br/>Formal Cause (why/what) - The RPG is, in part or in whole, a model for the type of experience sought in the Final Cause; there is an ideal being approached, but rarely ever reached, in the whole creation -&gt; play process.<br/>Final Cause (why) - The RPG is trying to evoke a certain type of play or emotional response, even if the latter is merely "have fun."<br/>--These two are where the rubber meets the road, where a game succeeds or fails, in the eyes of the designer. Note that, from a USE (play) perspective, a game can succeed while actually falling short of or utterly missing the designer's goal, in the mindspace of the players.<br/><br/>Annnd... I'm rambling a bit. Anything fruitful in all that? I kinda lost my train of thought.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200398/#Comment_200398" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-03T10:47:07+00:00" title="April  3, 2009 10:47AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The void, to me, is a combination of the point and the means to achieve the point.<br/><br/>Imagine what a trad game like D&amp;D would look like if characters had abilities like "acquire XP" or "slay dragon" or "roll on treasure table."

I see now that It happens to be rule <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> of the Jeep Truths) but doing so by focussing at a slightly different part of the process.<br/><br/>When you say 'Restictions fosters creativity" you assume that the error most probable to be made in game design that you might give too much freedom for players, while 'fruitful void'-angle assumes the direct opposite mistake. Both of them, of course, try to guide us towards the golden sweet spot.<br/><br/>I thought. Is this crazy?<br/><br/>I don't really understand so much of what has been written in this thread so far, so perhaps I am missing the mark completely.<br/><br/>Update: Yes, I realize that the idea of the fruitful void is a bit more elaborate than this. At least the way Vincent/Ron origanally described it it seems to refer more specifically to certain elements of a game.
