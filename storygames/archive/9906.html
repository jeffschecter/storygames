But I have it on good authority that if people are interested, he\u2019s willing to get together for ad hoc sessions.<br/><br/>Do you want a chance to play Braunstein, the grandfather of all roleplaying games? Do you want to grill him about what it was like gaming with Dave Arneson, before Blackmoor and before D&amp;D? Do you want to hear about antiaircraft artillery in WWII or soldier\u2019s wives in the Revolutionary War?<br/><br/>Speak up and let him know. He\u2019s probably reading <a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/125/braunstein-on-demand/" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> right now, so this is your chance.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
