Getting Players on the Same Page in a GMless Game.<br/><br/>So, some of my favorite story game experiences ever have happened in GMless games. I love it when the story seems to be appearing out of thin air and it's not clear in retrospect who added what. I also love the complexity and detail that can happen in a story with multiple people contributing. However, in my experience, the stories often seem a little all-over-the-place in terms of tone and theme. Also, events often seem to take a turn for the surreal/gonzo, which is fine, but I'd like to find ways to dial back the "anything goes" quality to our games. <br/><br/>Now, the obvious answer is for the group to discuss the type of story they want to tell in advance. And, that's all well and good, but what if you don't know in advance? What if you want to create the tone organically -- but then, somehow, agree on it within the game and stick to it. Is that an unrealistically high bar? Any ideas?                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412289/#Comment_412289" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-19T15:19:35+00:00" title="April 19, 2013  3:19PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Really close friends agree on unspoken things all the time because they're really in tune with each other's communication.

The latter requires you to listen, understand and appreciate, in addition to inventing your own contribution. (Unlike Jason, I'd like to suggest that this is a skill more than a relationship issue, although both definitely play a part.)<br/><br/>The zany tone you mention is a natural consequence of this skill level issue: players who aren't skilled enough to contribute at all will not participate meaningfully (whether they sit there or not), while players who are skilled enough will not break away with the story. The great mainstream in the middle, on the other hand, will be sufficiently skilled to make noise, but not enough to coordinate.<br/><br/>This phenomenon is a huge part of how people perceive roleplaying, by the way: roleplayers whose normal experience of roleplaying includes creative concord usually have completely different expectations of roleplaying (particularly story-oriented roleplaying) than those who do not regularly get this experience. The latter sometimes get that one magical session by accident (at a convention, for example), but misattribute it to e.g. the rule-set they happened to be playing with. How to encourage and enable this creative concord, that's one of the big rpg design questions.<br/><br/>The reason for why so many GMless games get you basically similar literary outcomes in this regard is that the socio-creative nature of the contribution is the same in all cases. The few games that differ from the profile are ones that have tools and structures that cause players to provide their input differently. However, these games are a minority due to where design is at, or perhaps due to that's what designers like to make: games that allow players short, discrete opportunities at very free scribing.<br/><br/>(For examples of games that work exactly like this, see the entire Forgean descend from say Under the Bed to Shab-al-Hiri Roach to Zombie Cinema and beyond. All games that at some point require players to simply add to the story within certain parameters. For an example of a differently GMless game, consider Labyrinths &amp; Lycanthropes; the feel is completely different because the game doesn't give players turns narrating stuff, and therefore does not require strictly being able to coordinate your storytelling.)<br/><br/>As for how to fix this, I don't think that you can do much except to get to know your co-players better and improve everybody's narrative skills. Or of course play a game that doesn't have this feature, or switch players until you get that creative concordance. Often enough it's sufficient to get 2-3 players in concordance to enjoy the game, really: they'll speak to each other and create towards each other, play against each other's contributions, and often this means that the rest of the players will find it easier to play with the support of this creative bulwark as well.<br/><br/>I probably would not have published <i>Zombie Cinema</i> were it not for the fact that I happened to have one really good player in our group at the time (as well as several more mediocre ones, of course). We've had a lot of fun playing these types of games together, simply because it's quite magical when you can just throw stuff out and the other guy <i>gets</i> what you're going for, and why, narratively speaking. At a table that does not have a pair of players with this sort of relationship it's much more difficult to get cohesion - basically impossible if you're not willing to break the game and become some sort of central authority micro-manager. These games simply assume that you've got that creative concord, they rarely give any meaningful tools for establishing it if it is lacking. (And no, various veto rules, such as the one in <i>Universalis</i>, do not help, really - they acknowledge the issue, but their existence helps very rarely.)<br/><br/>Incidentally, I don't really believe in pre-planning as a solution here: if the pre-planned game is like the ones I discuss above, then all you're getting by preplanning is some macro-level setting detail. That does not help in actual play, as the game still relies on the players actually communicating meaningfully at each other. Maybe they'll all know not to introduce space ships in the story, but that just means that they'll have an opportunity to miss something else, instead. To get play to maintain cohesion you'd need to stop constantly to reorient and draw a picture for the players who didn't realize which plot we're following at the moment, and then you're basically playing a different game already. For example, in Zombie Cinema it wouldn't help at all if we all agreed that the zombies will be space zombie monsters if the other player still would miss it when I establish my character as an abusive husband for the sake of foreshadowing. The only real solution is to get that communication channel working consistently.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412292/#Comment_412292" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-19T16:31:55+00:00" title="April 19, 2013  4:31PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder if the principle of "Shared GMing" could apply?

Is that an unrealistically high bar? Any ideas? </blockquote>\nWhat do you mean with "in advance"? Would it be sufficient if the participants laid down the tone as a preparation for the game during the session? I'm right now in a group where playing with a GM is rare, and the times we use a GM, most of the GM domains are handed over to the players.<br/><br/><b>Three problems</b><br/>Something I noticed is that the game turns gonzo when there are too many strange things involved. This is something that the game itself could restrict, like in <b>Fiasco</b>'s playsets. Most of the times, all strangeness could be involved in the story but it will be involved at the cost of turning the story quirky. The problem is that the group doesn't self-censor itself. No one wants to tell another person that an idea is over the top, because that could be treated as blocking the other person's idea. The thing is that some players (me as an example) just throw in things to see how it will be incorporated, and have no idea at all of how it should be done.<br/><br/>A third reason why things turns gonzo is when a player is trying to hard. That person wants to be noticed and throws in space bums or living false teeth that communicate through clatter Morse code. What seems like a cool idea could mess up the whole story. A Shakespearian drama could easily incorporate the false teeth on the fly, but it will be incorporated at the cost of the story.<br/><br/><b>Two solutions</b><br/>What you need is a structure for communication during the session. You could have a reoccurring phase in the game where you stop and talk about what you're playing at the moment. What tracks there are in the scenario and leads that players wants to to be more important.<br/><br/>You could also lay out some ground rules to make the communication more clear.<br/>1) Have a theme/tone/genre and follow it. The theme could grow organically but the chance of having a successful session will decrease dramatically if the group isn't on the same wave length. Agree that it's OK to remind people to both <i>understand</i> and follow the theme. This IS a sensitive topic, because it can create a hierarchy where the players that have a better sense of what works will be judged of what works and what not. A hierarchy some people can come to dislike. It's also a sensitive topic because some players will take offence and feel that others think that their ideas is better. Basically, it all narrows down to communications. To have a ground rule that it's OK to point out theme-breaking ideas, and by doing that it has nothing to do with shooting down others ideas.<br/><br/>2) Have a way to indirect tell the others if you have an idea of how things could turn out or if you are just throwing in stuff to see where it's heading. This is something I've come across a lot during our sessions, and I discovered that it works better if I tell everybody that they are allowed to jump in and take over my descriptions whenever they want. People don't want to do this in general, because they don't want to interfere with another person's ideas. One way of communicating if you're in control of where things are going or if it's just something your throw in, is to tell that while you're framing scenes, to place your hand on certain areas on a game board, holding stuff or doing other kinds of gestures. Every time you establish anything, tell the others if it's part of your future plans or not.<br/><br/>3) Come to an agreement that the players shouldn't try so hard. Say the first thing that come into mind rather than making things spectacular. This may seem obvious but I would dare you to go the other way, and having the group come up with the weirdest shit, so you can discover how gonzo it gets. The more tight the stories are - when things just seem to fit together of their own - the better they are. Even in games that have themes such as <b>Gamma World</b>, you need more normal elements than weird ones.<br/><br/>4) Be clear when you're establishing story elements that you want to be are important. Always start the session with establishment scenes. Press hard on subjects that you want to be a part of the story. You can do this with hand gestures or by framing scenes by telling the others which ones of your character's traits and goals that you want to show. Establishing things are so very, very important. Not having enough things established can even <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/410532#Comment_410532" rel="nofollow">kill your creativity</a>.<br/><br/>Sorry for the long post. :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412306/#Comment_412306" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-19T20:23:29+00:00" title="April 19, 2013  8:23PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Make it that each player can ask for up to X number of points for some fiction to go though.

I think there are two main issues involved:<br/><br/>1. Which contributions should be limited, vetoed, or modified? How does your game or group handle this?<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> covered this nicely, above. Of course, figuring out the answers to those questions is not all that simple.<br/><br/>2. What guides the players in their contributions? What can they rely on for tone, story elements, reincorporation, etc?<br/><br/>This half hasn't been discussed as much in this thread, but is also key. In a GMful game, you need some which limits or constrains creativity (#1, above), and then you also need something which inspires and helps the players create new material.<br/><br/>Balancing these is an interesting process! You need procedures which help you (individually, or as a group) create new material and expand the scope of play, and you also need procedures which keep everyone focused and heading in the same direction.<br/><br/>Discussing the specifics is impossible unless we know what people we're dealing with (the skill level and relationship/trust, as discussed above) and what kind of game we're dealing with.<br/><br/>That said, here are two other things which can help with this problem:<br/><br/>1. Structuring the game or the story in such a way that different parts of the game can have different 'flavours'. For instance, in my game Land of Nodd, each character has his or her own storyline, and it's often interesting if each storyline has a very different "feel" to it. Maybe character A has a fast-paced, action story, while character B's story is all furtive glances in the dark and weird unexplained moments of dread. <br/><br/>Put one player in charge of each of those stories, and their personal tone helps add to the effect (or creates it in the first place).<br/><br/>2. A rich palette of evocative fiction, details, or genre elements is incredibly helpful.<br/><br/>If you put some kind of materials in front of the players, whether it's a list of things which could feature in the game (e.g. a Fiasco playset), some artwork/soundscapes, or other referents, that really helps everyone draw inspiration from the same bucket.<br/><br/>For example, I used to play a round-robin style storytelling game with a bunch of non-gamers. It always got way too gonzo, unfocused, silly, all over the place. It was fun, but not coherent or satisfying. So I got them together again and put in front of them the Skins from Monsterhearts along with a Fiasco-style playset I put together for the game. Everyone "got in the mood" immediately just by reading through the materials: the tone of the game and the genre was obvious, and there was no need to help these same people on the same page. They immediately knew what to do, and what would be appropriate or not.<br/><br/>Polaris, as mentioned earlier, hits you in the face so hard with its particular tone that it's hard to escape: I can't really see any player in a Polaris game narrating in some flying slapstick pineapple scene. (And if they do, everyone else will call them on it!)<br/><br/>Another good example is Apocalypse World. Just looking through the playbooks, we all know what to expect from the genre and the playstyle, and then the mechanics themselves reinforce the themes of the game (e.g. scarcity).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412412/#Comment_412412" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-22T08:52:25+00:00" title="April 22, 2013  8:52AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 22, 2013 8:52AM by AMBayard.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Discussing the specifics is impossible unless we know what people we're dealing with (the skill level and relationship/trust, as discussed above) and what kind of game we're dealing with.<br/></blockquote>\nThis strikes me as an important statement. <br/><br/>It seems there are two big themes in this thread that might be in tension: 1) there are procedural solutions; and 2) you just have to get the "right" group to make it work. <br/><br/>Hmm . . .                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412414/#Comment_412414" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-22T09:08:54+00:00" title="April 22, 2013  9:08AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think they're in tension; they're just both very important elements.<br/><br/>Just like the design of a car's controls/brakes and the skills of its driver are both important elements in preventing a car crash.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412415/#Comment_412415" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-22T09:42:52+00:00" title="April 22, 2013  9:42AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah.

Something that can be combined with my idea of having scenes to establish traits/goal: have each character's goal be written as a title in a chapter of a book. I don't know how that would work, but I think it could give a nice touch to the game if each scene started with one player saying a trait (or relation/goal) and then everything in the scene is leading up to either expose, destroy or change that trait.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
