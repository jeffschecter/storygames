The boards were now painted or incised on a flat slab of stone, wood or faience and all contained religious decorations in the final five squares. Several contemporary Twentieth Dynasty gameboards have all 30 of their squares decorated with religious designs. Although now partially destroyed, enough details remain to show that they correspond exactly to the descriptions in the gaming texts. These boards, probably used in a ritual form, correspond with the development of religious gaming texts. <b>In these texts, the player narrates in the first person the journey of his draughtsmen through the squares and the events which befall them there</b>. Seemingly, then, those texts describe that ritual, if they are not the recitation of the ritual itself.</i> [emphasis mine]<br/><br/>Interesting, no? I'm especially intrigued by the religious/ritual nature of the game, and how it incorporates elements of story. Read with me:<br/><br/><i>Square 27 depicted the "Waters of Chaos" over which the netherworld bark floated as it rose into heaven at dawn. Sinners, denied a place in the bark, were drowned in these waters; thus, as the words of one gaming text aptly showed, square 27 was the ultimate senet pitfall: "I seize his gamepieces so that he might drown together with his gamepieces. I throw him into the water." Draughtsmen who landed on it had to be removed from the board.</i><br/><br/>Not that it's particularly shocking to see a board game that's a metaphor or fictionalized simulation of something else, but I like the flavor of Senet, and I wonder if games of this sort can't be incorporated somehow into an RPG that uses it to facilitate a story.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Morris" title="Andrew Morris"><img alt="Andrew Morris" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.plaguemonkey.com/sgicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Morris">Andrew Morris</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218151/#Comment_218151" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-13T19:19:06+00:00" title="July 13, 2009  7:19PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.clevelandart.org/kids/egypt/senet.html" rel="nofollow">Online Senet game</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218153/#Comment_218153" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-13T19:34:08+00:00" title="July 13, 2009  7:34PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 13, 2009 7:34PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool stuff Hans.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I buy the author's theory that winning senet gave you afterlife protection -- if that was the case, wouldn't you just play it all day rather than doing anything else?<br/><br/>Learning all the hazards that awaited you in the afterlife was considered essential reading. Kind of like SATs of death. Which is why it was wise to get buried with a copy of the Book of the Dead (cheat sheet for easy reference), because let's face it, memorizing all the correct answers to the Negative Confession, plus all the passwords to get past all the gate-keepers would be a lot of work.<br/><br/>Senet seems more like an indirect learning aid, familiarizing yourself with the stuff you'll have to face in the afterlife through play, kind of like the Book of the Dead lite. Sim-Afterlife. Like the old Life board game with the car and the little pegs for your spouse and children.<br/><br/>I think the idea that they would make a board game out of the afterlife shows less mystical reverence, and more a very practical integration between this life and the next -- they're not separating the two as being really that different. It's just life 2.0.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
