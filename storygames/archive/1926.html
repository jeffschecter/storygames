                    Hey, we all qualify, right?  Or is that Unsavory Nerds?  Patronizing Old Timers?  <br/><br/>Anyway, I'm working on a small game about the lives and loves of photocopy repairmen.  You can check out a draft <a href="http://www.meekmok.com/sassy/games/business_solutions/business_solutions_4.2.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  The client service log is <a href="http://www.meekmok.com/sassy/games/business_solutions/bsi_ticket_2.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  <br/><br/>I'd love some feedback!  This is a light game you'd play in 90 minutes, maybe two hours if you hammed it up.  There's some card handling, photocopier repair, and a lot of schadenfreude.<br/><br/>Specific questions:  <br/><br/>Is it too fiddly for what it is?  (what it is being a humorous, three player GM-less game)<br/>Does the card mechanic make sense as written?  Can you imagine playing this?<br/>Isbo suggested ditching Need - what do you think?  Necessary or extraneous?<br/>Suggestions for refining attitudes and roles?  Suggestions for other Needs?<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>

<blockquote>Is it too fiddly for what it is?  (what it is being a humorous, three player GM-less game)</blockquote>
No, it's fine. The cards sound very quick and easy.
<blockquote>Does the card mechanic make sense as written?</blockquote>
It's totally straightforward.
<blockquote>Can you imagine playing this?</blockquote>
Yes.
<blockquote>Isbo suggested ditching Need - what do you think?  Necessary or extraneous?</blockquote>
No! Don't ditch Need! I mean, I haven't played the game, but I get the feeling that Need is pivotal.<br/><br/>When I first read through the rules, Need reminded me of the pool refreshes in Shadow of Yesterday. You know how, in TSoY, you can get all your points back by, say, indulging in a night of physical excess? That's how I imagined Need: so, if you've got Slack as a Need, you can automatically get a bonus card by going for a cigarette while you should be working.<br/><br/>If it was me, I'd make the Needs much more specific and indisputable (e.g. "Slack: You can get a bonus card by going for a cigarette at a crucial moment. Power: You can get a bonus card by yelling at the client."). And I'd take the decision away from the other players, and let the player who used the need claim his bonus card automatically.<br/><br/>(If I was going for broke, I'd also suggest that Bonus Cards shouldn't just apply for invoking Needs, but should be a general kind of Fan Mail system: the other players could give you a Bonus Card every time you did something cool. However, Needs would be a guaranteed way of getting a bonus card. You know, if it was me.)
<blockquote>Suggestions for other Needs?</blockquote>
I'd actually break some of the current Needs down, making them more specific. So for Attention, I'd break into, say...<br/><br/>Crybaby: Gain a bonus card if you sob on the client's shoulder<br/>Hypochondriac: Gain a bonus card if you tell the client about a disease which you're convinced you have.<br/>Frustrated Artist: Gain a bonus card if you sing, dance or recite.<br/>Job Hater: Gain a bonus card if you convince the client that Business Solutions is the worst employer in the world.<br/><br/>Something like that, anyway.<br/><br/>Also, the PDF is way too cleanly printed. When you do the finished game, it should definitely have a slghtly grey background and an inexplicable black line from top to bottom.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Thanks, Graham, I'm looking forward to turning the design over to the Mad Irishman, BPG's layout guy, to utterly wreck.  I'm imagining it looking like the worst office manual you've ever seen.  <br/><br/>There's a tricksy card balance - if it is easier to get "free cards", the initial load-out of eleven needs to be pared down a lot.    Not insurmountable, and I really like the idea of having more closely defined Needs.  It won't get tedious because each character only appears in a total of four challenges, and the "invoke your Need for a free card" thing could be reasonably restricted to one per scene.  Hmm.  Liking it.  And your Type, when exemplified, is worth fan mail.  Cool.                        </div>

                            Here's what I'm imagining now:  <br/><br/>Each character has a <i>Need</i>, and they should not overlap.  Needs can be manifested once per scene, and provide a bonus card during the challenge in which they are invoked.  Players should choose Needs they'll enjoy from the list of twelve:<br/><br/>Authority:  Utterly dominate a photocopy machine.<br/>Power:  Utterly dominate someone.<br/>Lunacy:  Do something that attracts the attention of security or law enforcement personnel.<br/>Peace:  Avoid a confrontation.<br/>Sympathy: Find a shoulder to cry on.<br/>Crime:  Deceive someone or steal something.<br/>Decorum:  Maintain professionalism in the face of outrageous behavior.<br/>Slack:  Take a smoke break and let your partner do all the work.<br/>Artistry: Create music, poetry, or visual art.<br/>Lust:  Make a pass at someone.<br/>Loyalty:  Convince a client that Business Solutions is the best company in the world.<br/>Mutiny:  Convince a client that Business Solutions is the worst company in the world.                        </div>

                            Oh my, this hits close to home. I used to work in a copy center, for a business solutions corporation. I had the direct mobile numbers of the Konica-Minolota copier techs, who came to regard me with respect and dread. I very nearly ended up in that vocation myself. This is hilarious.  I can offer all kinds of street cred for this.                        </div>

                            I have only been able to skim the rules so far (which look pretty damn funny!) but I was wondering whether this game would scale to a larger group or whether it's three players or nothing?  My Tuesday one-shot group gets between 2-5 people depending on schedules and if it's 3 players only I would need to wait until we had a 3-person night.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>Chris                        </div>

                            I will get on it. <br/><br/>It occures to me that this could be used as a wonderful base for playing a game based on Charlie Stross' "The Atrocity Archives". The book is superficially about espionage agents tasked with keeping cthonian stuff under wraps. But it really is about dealing with people in an organization. <br/><br/>That's two great engines I want to build on. Curse You!                        </div>

It's kind of a shame, though, because it's very rare that I've got [i]exactly[/i] two other players to play with, and I know no-one else will turn up or drop out. It makes it less likely I'd play the game: at least, I wouldn't plan to play it on a games evening, in case there were more or less than three.<br/><br/>Oh, hey, I wanted to say. I feel the faults table is too simple: any fault has four simple answers and you just guess. I'd like something a bit more convoluted: something which expresses that <i>usually</i> the cause of streaky copies is a badly installed blade, but <i>sometimes</i> it's toner overflow and <i>once in a blue moon</i> a rat gets trapped in the machine. That sort of thing.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Funny, Graham, because I regularly game with two other people, so three is natural for me.  There aren't many games optimized for that number.  Shooting the Moon is the only one that comes to mind.  I'll think about ways to make it work with more or less - maybe assigning client scenes to players three and four and technicians to players one and two?<br/><br/>I took your advice about bonus cards, Graham - I lowered the initial total to nine and allow up to two per scene in bonus by Need and Type.  More fun, good way to encourage using them, because if you don't, you're hosed.  <br/><br/>At one point I thought about introducing a Clue-like set of dependencies (IF the fuser drum is overheating THEN look at the wiper blade OR the corona wires) but it seemed needlessly complicated.  Is the guessing mini-game just dull?  It's a prelude to the regular conflict rather than a full-blown conflict itself, but I felt that some sort of diagnostic roleplay moment would be fun (and it is).                        </div>

                            Just my two cents--<br/><br/>I like the new Need mechanic a lot better than the old one.  I can see lots of easy ways to tap into it during play as well as why I would do that.  I'm not entirely sure Artistry would work as well as the others though in terms of generating really neat roleplaying interactions.                        </div>

                            You Need to create visual art and you are trapped in the copy room of ComNetBizCorp?  Surrounded by nothing but a broken photocopier and ream after ream of astro-bright paper and post-its?  I can see all kinds of things that could meet that Need, and every one of them is irritating, idiotic, or destructive.  On one level it is essentially passive/reactive, but so are a couple of the other ones.  Do you think Needs should force interaction?                        </div>

                            Must consider ...  So you've got this universal resource that helps you overcome both technical and social challenges.  There is nothing that can happen in the game that this resource cannot directly address.  It makes you a good photocopy repairman and also able to schmooze with the file clerk and mack on the secretary.  I think "Self Respect" is off, but I like the direction - some ineffable, self-reflective thing.                        </div>

                            I don't know, Sara, it seems ripe for hacks - just replace "copies too dark" with "bum in the lobby".  Thanks for the compliment!  Actually I think it works better in situations where there is an object to focus on - in that light, the IT tech support expansion is a no-brainer.  You could probably work up a version for diesel mechanics or carpenters.                        </div>

                            How does Professionalism fit when you are putting forward cards to sweet talk your ex-wife into not phoning in your restraining order violation?  That's a relationship challenge.  I think the term needs to be even vaguer.  I dunno, maybe I'm stuck in my own head on this one.                        </div>

                            I actually really like the term 'mojo,' so far better than any term I have seen suggested to replace it.  But then, I liked playing the Unsavory Hipster, and that just seems like how he would describe his 'special magic.'<br/><br/>To Artistry: I think there are two things going on with the artist need for me.  One, it just doesn't leap out at me as involving other players which is where most of the fun in the playtest came for me (I see how it <i>can</i>...but only with some finagling).  Second, though, the sorts of things I see myself using to tap it for the card seem a little Dada-esque absurd, which doesn't quite seem to fit with the particular banal absurdities that drive the game.  It might push play a little outside the sweet spot to which it seems best-suited.                        </div>

                            I see your point, Isbo.  Hopefully we'll get some playtests going on and see if it rings sour for others as well, and if better Needs surface.  I'm not wedded to it by any means, but it seems like a good fit in some ways.  <br/><br/>And I'm also with you on Mojo thusfar, but I'm glad to keep getting suggestions.                        </div>

                            Here's what I've got:<br/><br/>THE CATCH PHRASE<br/>Each game of Business Solutions needs a catch phrase, and the players will compete for the honor of coining it.  Each player, in turn, should stand up and "read" an imaginary paragraph from the Business Solutions, Incorporated employee manual.  The paragraph title should be a trendy buzzword or odious corporate drone-speak, couched in soul-crushing motivational language.  The catch phrase refers, broadly, to repair technicians' skill at both fixing copiers and managing interpersonal crises.  It should be vague and meaningless.<br/><br/>After each player has presented a concept from the employee manual, the clear winner will probably be obvious.  if not, a majority vote may be necessary.  If no one can agree, either come up with three more or use Mojo, which is used throughout the rules as the default.<br/><br/>Some examples of catch phrases:<br/><br/>Six Sigma<br/>Q-Factor<br/>Total Quality<br/>Customer Satisfaction<br/>Interoperability<br/>The BS Way<br/>Performance<br/>l337 Sk1llz<br/>Effectiveness<br/>Excellence<br/>Finesse<br/>Value<br/>The Stuff<br/>Professionalism<br/>Sangfroid<br/>The Edge<br/><br/>Of course, these can be combined into hideous amalgams - Total Value, Performance-Q, and so forth.  Adding "plus" or "system" to any catch phrase makes it more potent.  <br/><br/>EXAMPLE OF CATCH PHRASE CREATION<br/><br/>MIKE:  Who's grabbing the employee handbook first?<br/><br/>STEVE:  I am.  Let's see.  Section Four: Ã‰lan. It's a funny French word, but those four letters mean business. It was the notion of Ã©lan that caused the French army to get butchered in the First World War, but here at Business Solutions, Incorporated we've taken it to the next level with total quality. As a BSI employee, you'll be expected to embody the principle of Ã©lan every day - on the battlefield and off.<br/><br/>VAL:  Very nice.  How about this:  Section Seven:  Love Plus.  Here at Business Solutions, we love what we do - all of us, all the time.  It's mandatory!  And what's more, we love our customers - that's the Love Plus principle.  Love Plus is why we go that extra mile.  Love Plus is why we leave a mint on every copy machine we service.  Love Plus - live it, love it.  <br/><br/>MIKE:  I just threw up a little.                        </div>

                            That's great.<br/><br/>You'll hate me for this, but the phrase "catch phrase" doesn't <i>quite</i> seem right. I even find it slightly confusing. A catch phrase would be "We love to serve you best!" or "Smile! It's what the customer wants!". "Love Plus" and "Elan" and "Total Quality" are, in my opinion, "buzz words".<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Sure, but that's what you call them when you want something derogatory. The manual wouldn't use "buzz words." It'd call it a "Corporate Value System." I have a little tee-pee on my desk with my company's "Corporate Values" on it (Honesty, Innovation, Customer Focus, etc, etc). It also has the purpose statement, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Should they also come up with a company misison statement?<br/>

So there is a slim possibility that we can pull a playtest. Is the doc at the top ready to go or is there a newer version?                        </br></br></div>

                            Never! story games is about nice not about borders.  I did the Grocery thing for about a year while I was trying to wean myself off the copy business. The hours suck, the pay sucks, too many of the people that rise to positions of power suck, but it's always sunny and 68Â° in the grocery; so you aint in the grave.                        </div>

                            i wonder if the grave would feel cozy-er.  so far i've done nearly 2(years).  my gaming is at a near standstill.  it blows.  surprisely no one wants to play at twelve o'clock at night until four in the morning?   how the hell do third shifters do it?  i've talked to many third shifters asking if the ever get "used to it", and they usually say you never do.  :-(  <br/>dating is impossible.                        </div>

I've never done this before let me know if there is anything else I can provide.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the game. In addition to the information there, Joe has been playing for as long as I have and is very competative, which drove a part of the game that Phil, Pete and I would probably not have being fairly passive people.                        </div>

                            Dude, thanks so much!  That's a great, useful post and gives me a ton of insight into how to improve game play.  I'm glad the stuff that worked, worked and that the stuff that didn't wasn't wretched enough to ruin your fun.                        </div>

                            today at work i was talking to some totally non-gamer types about this project. They were profoundly amazed:<br/><br/>"so like you talk about being a repair man, and how that stinks"<br/><br/>"Well kind of, yeah"<br/><br/>"So i can complain about my job, and also complain about a job thats even worse than mine?"<br/><br/>"I guess so."<br/><br/>"Thats awesome."<br/><br/>The regular folks dug it. Now i'm not sure i could make that step to get them to actually play, but they wanted to look through a book at the very least. Hopefully soon i'll round up some real folks for a playtest.                        </div>

                            In my first playtest I was sort of floored by the grace with which the players adopted these personas - the roles carry markers that are so close to home for anyone who has ever worked in a bureaucracy that people seemed to jump right in and start creating great stuff immediately.  Faster than usual.  This excites me.                        </div>
