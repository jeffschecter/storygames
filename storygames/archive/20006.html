This is me doing a thing I should've done ages ago -- dropping in a link to our Kickstarter for The Last Days of Anglekite, a Dungeon World setting of over-the-top epic weird fantasy. We've successfully funded thanks to our awesome backers, but right now we're really hoping to push to more stretch goals, because if we do, then all backers at $10 or up are getting three full books in PDF form. At the moment, backers get The Last Days of Anglekite (and in a mostly-done version, available immediately in the very first update), and they'll be getting The Cold Ruins of Lastlife, a second setting that's more about weird horror fantasy in the vein of Dark Souls. If we get far enough, then the third book will be The Green Law of Varkith, weird urban fantasy in a cosmopolitan city with one overriding law -- no one is allowed to exist as an individual; everyone must be part of an organization greater than themselves. There's a lot more about each on the actual Kickstarter page.<br/><br/>I'm happy to answer any questions you might have! Thanks so much for checking it out!<br/><br/><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/marktruman/the-last-days-of-anglekite-a-chaos-world-from-magp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/marktruman/the-last-days-of-anglekite-a-chaos-world-from-magp</a><br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>Brendan Conway                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
