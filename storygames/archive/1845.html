                    So one of Paul Czege's more famous quotes is something like:<br/><br/><i>When the same person is the author of both a characterâ€™s adversity and its resolution, play isnâ€™t fun.</i><br/><br/>I don't want to argue about this.  I agree with it (for now) and want to take it as a given for the purposes of this conversation.<br/><br/>However, in my experience, most games tend to address this concern in a rather specific way. Character adversity is modeled using inter-player conflict. Two or more players want different things to happen in the fiction and that conflict is reflected in the adversity a character faces or an in-game conflict between two different characters.  Here's an example:<br/><br/><b>Player:</b> I scale the side of the castle.<br/><b>GM:</b> Oh, really?  Well the castle wall is pretty treacherous.  Roll your Climb skill at -15%.<br/><br/>Walla, adversity!  According to traditional game wisdom, the player wants her character to climb the wall and the GM doesn't want that to happen, hence the need for the mechanics to come in and resolve their differences.<br/><br/>But this is bogus.  Perhaps the player doesn't want her character to easily scale the wall.  Perhaps she chose to climb the wall because she expected it to be difficult and wants her character to fail a bunch of times before succeeding, giving the player the chance to express her character, win the sympathies and admiration of her fellow players, and eventually achieve a kind of catharsis when her character eventually triumphs.<br/><br/>On the other hand, does the GM really want the character to fail at wall-climbing?  Perhaps he has other motivations as well.  Perhaps he wants to give the castle wall some narrative weight, making it seem ominous and treacherous, and forcing a roll to climb it goes part of the way to achieving that.  Or perhaps he thinks the character should scramble up the wall with ease but the rules or player expectations make him think that a roll would be appropriate or contribute to "realism."<br/><br/>Another example, from a <i>Jedi in the Vineyard</i> game:<br/><br/><b>GM:</b> Okay, the dark jedi swings a lightsabre at you, trying to cut off your arm! (Raise 6, 5)<br/><b>Player: </b> Yowsa!  I parry with my own lightsabre. (See 8, 3)<br/><br/>Here, what if the player thinks it would be much cooler for her character to fail and lose an arm.  After all, Star Wars is all about people loosing limbs in lightsabre duels and being angsty cyborgs because of it.  But because inter-player adversity is assumed to be the force that drives character adversity, the player feels like she has to resist the GM's attempt to harm her character.  If she Takes The Blow, there doesn't seem to be any adversity here.  Whop, her character's arm gets chopped off (maybe through Fallout or maybe just because people decide that's what happens), and while there may be narrative weight to that act (I mean, losing an arm should be a big deal in most stories), there's no mechanical weight, because it's not like she lost a hard-fought fight.  She just gave in.<br/><br/>So here's my question:<br/><br/><b>How do you create adversity without relying on inter-player conflicts?</b><br/><br/>Concrete play examples would probably be best, because otherwise this'll get pretty abstract very fast.<br/><br/>I suspect that the answer might lie in having processes that negotiate out an interesting result even when players generally agree on what should happen.  When I was playtesting the Exalted Hack at JiffyCon, it totally failed to do this.  Instead, our play went like this:<br/><br/>Player 1: "Let's do X! That's awesome!"<br/>Player 2: "Dude, yeah!  And then Y!"<br/>Player 3: "Y would be cool, but not as cool as Z!"<br/>Player 2: "Dude, you are so right!  Z forever!"<br/>Player 1: "Z totally rocks my socks! Boo-yeah!"<br/><br/>So there was total agreement on the awesome shit that was going down.  And yet, just as Paul predicts, there was a lot of Not Fun happening because we were resolving our own adversity all the time.  We would invent undead sea monsters and zombie pirates and, just as easily, whisk them away when they no longer interested us.  A ghostly gatekeeper asked characters to give up the things they treasured most and the players said "That's awesome!" and willingly handed them over.<br/><br/>I guess, from another perspective, I'm looking for ways for the players to not necessarily have to mechanically back their own characters' actions in conflicts.  I don't want to have to be a good sport and fight hard for my character to win when I want them to lose horribly.  That causes some bizarre mental dissonance for me where I have to forget what I really want to happen in play.  When asked to play along, I tend to become too sympathetic to individual characters and lose sight of what's best for the overall game and fight hard for the character to win when they shouldn't, creating Not Fun.  I want to be able to put my narrative authority into fighting for what I, the player, actually believe in, even if it's the tragic failure of my character.<br/><br/>However, I want the resolution to be interesting, dramatic, filled with tension, and exhibiting real adversity even if everybody agrees on what should happen.  Because while the outcome may be decided, the process by which we arrive there and the exact details of its enactment are still up in the air.  And there's plenty of room for the process to surprise us interesting ways, possibly even resulting in conclusions that are more interesting than the ones we would have come up with on our own.<br/><br/><i>Dogs</i> regularly delivers in this regard, with outcomes being more interesting then the inputs, but it doesn't feel like players have much control over the overall direction of the outcome (which works great for <i>Dogs</i>, but maybe not for other things).  Instead, you put all these explosive individuals together and they negotiate an outcome based on their character traits and die rolls, making the outcome more contingent on things not determined by the players, at least compared to what I'm looking for in this particular instance.  Imagine walking into a conflict  knowing that your character was gonna die and the fun part was learning how that would happen, not determining whether that death would happen.<br/><br/>Is that clear?  If so, what are the different ways in which we could set that up?                </div>

                            Jonathan, consider use of Fan Mail in <em>PTA</em>: you spend Fan Mail on conflict you care about, so if you run up into that fight with the big bad, but you want to lose, you don't spend Fan Mail and don't tap Edges/Connections and you rely only on your Screen Presence.  In many situations, that is very close to buying the loss you wanted.  Additionally, since you tend to roleplay right up to the decision point in the conflict, you can "play it to the hilt" and then only ask for your one or two cards.<br/><br/>However, I think the thing you're after is better expressed in stakes, and I think what you may be groping for is more complicated stakes.  If there was, for instance, always three pairs of stakes in any conflict, and the conflict resolution determined each of them in a discrete but related manner?  For example: lightsaber fight.  Stake A: Jedi Defeats Sith/Sith Defeaths Jedi.  Stake B: Hostages Escape/Hostages Don't Escape.  Stake C: Sith Cuts off Jedi's Hand/Jedi Remains Intact.  Now if you as a player had to spread your plot-resources out among those three sets of stakes and resolve them all concurrently, you could go for freeing the hostages and maybe defeating the Sith at the probable cost of your hand, or you could defeat the Sith first and foremost, keep your limbs together, and assume the hostages can be freed after the sith is defeated.  (Whether your resources are used straight or turn into dice or whatever is a matter of specific implementation.)  Hm.  Sounds like Capes.                        </div>

                            JBR, your ideas fascinate me and I want to subscribe, etc.<br/><br/>Three sets of stakes, non-mutually exclusive, sounds like an interesting space to explore.<br/><br/>This discussion is relevant to my current project, Acts of Desperation, which follows a 5-act structure. An explicit part of the structure is that in Acts 3 and 4 the protagonists are basically getting pasted. They have to make tough choices, give up things that are valuable to them etc. in order to make it to the triumph in Act 5.<br/><br/>I'm taking a three-pronged approach. Firstly, I have a kind of partial GM called the Opposition who provides pain for the protagonists.<br/><br/>Secondly, I lay out the 5-act structure and say "this is what should be happening in each Act, if you're succeeding too much at the wrong time here are some suggestions on how to make things worse", and instructing all the players to collaborate on coming up with complications.<br/><br/>But thirdly, what I'm attempting, and I may not succeed, is to build some of the creation of adversity into the <b>system</b> (which I think may be a good general answer to the concerns you raise about player-created adversity). My current approach is to set up the dice mechanic such that if you succeed a lot, you start failing, but if you fail a lot, you start succeeding. But I suspect I'll have to do something else as well.                        </div>

<b>Paul:</b> Yeah, as is <i>The World, the Flesh, and the Devil</i>.  However, if you set stakes that you're willing to give up, I find that it destroys the power of resolution, because they don't feel like sacrifices.  If I want my character's hand to get chopped off, then choosing it as one of the negative stakes is weird, because then OF COURSE I let that one fail and focus on the other two.  There's no hard choices to make after the dice are rolled.<br/><br/><b>JBR:</b> Fanmail is more like what I'm getting at, but, even then, it's not clear to the other players where your loyalties lie until you ask for your cards.  There no sense that the possible outcomes are group-determined.  And situations where one player has 10 cards while the other has 2 don't contain much tension or antagonism.  While the buildup may be full of anticipation, once you get to resolution it seems like a cop-out if you just ask for a couple cards.  It really kills the emotion.  And maybe the other guy wanted to lose too, but you were both bluffing and planning to take as few cards as possible.  So now, no matter how it goes, you'll end up with an outcome that someone will be unhappy with.                        </div>

                            I was suddenly reminded, while reading this thread, that Ron has said that in Sorcerer you don't roll dice to decide what happens when I am in conflict with you, you roll dice only when two characters in the fiction are in conflict. <br/><br/>If you secretly want your character to fail? So? It isn't about what you want, it is about what your character wants. If we both want out characters to win? Then it's much like interpersonal conflict, but its not really about us, its about what is happening in the fiction. If we both want out characters to lose and one must win? Well hell, that's hot shit because now the story is going to go in a different way than what we wanted. <br/><br/>Outside that, I have a question -- the Exalted game you describe. Where did the not fun come from? I mean, if everyone is really as excited and invested and into it as they sound like they are (AWESOME!!) then where is the not fun? Is it because they really weren't that excited, because they really wished something else would happen? <br/><br/>I mean, I have trouble seeing where if I'm playing a game and everyone is honestly, down to their bone, so jazzed about everything happening that they never have any reason to want anything different to happen, where that becomes not fun. Is it because it stops feeling like a game? Because there isn't any adversity between players? And why, then, do you need adversity between players? <br/><br/>Also, why would a player have to solve their own adversity in that situation? Couldn't you set up adversity (AWESOME!) for someone else who then resolves it (AWESOME!)? So that the whole 'set up and resolve your own' issue doesn't count? Is it because you were doing everything as a group, and so "our own" rather than "your own" came to dominate the way you handled all adversity? <br/><br/>I ask so many questions because this is some hot shit. I've long felt that there is both an over-reliance upon and under-understanding of the way that adversity works in the levels of game, story, and social arena (which are three very different levels that we constantly and mistakenly conflate), and so I think there is some real meat here.                        </div>

<b>Mike:</b> Systemic adversity has been tried in a few places, mostly as a reaction to <i>My Life with Master</i>'s Love &amp; Despair scores.  <i>Polaris</i> and <i>Breaking the Ice</i> are the ones that immediately come to mind.  But that also leads to weird situations when characters can fail when all the players agree they should succeed.  Imagine an amazingly elaborate and thematically appropriate scheme to kill the Master -- one that everyone thinks should be the crowning achievement of a few nights play -- that still fails.

                            Jonathan, <br/><br/>You said: "But that also leads to weird situations when characters can fail when all the players agree they should succeed"<br/><br/>So its a situation where the mechanics lead the story more towards the "other" end of the I/other spectrum? As in "it isn't my story, or your story. Sometimes it isn't even "our" story -- it is simple "the story." <br/><br/>Because I think that is the point of play in a lot of those games. I used to have a narrative writing prof whose favorite quote was "No surprise for the author, no surprise for the reader." So those systems are ways of getting you to be surprised by the story even when you both thought you knew where it was going. It's pretty much the band that Vincent was talking about in his essay on anyway about those who want to know what kind of story they're telling before they start vs those who want to be honestly surprised by the story at the end.<br/><br/>Edit: <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=259" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=259</a> -- link to the Vincent thing I was talking about                        </div>

Jonathon, that's just plain bad stake-setting. I thought one of most useful things that came out of the conflict res thing is the idea that a conflict is only a conflict if we want it to be a conflict. If you want your hand to be chopped off, and I want your hand to be chopped off, then fine, it's chopped off! It's Vincent's "say yes or roll the dice". You just said "yes", where's the conflict?<br/><br/>In a recent-ish game of tMW, one of the ronin said, "I want to seduce that woman-spirit". I said, "I have no problem with that---But!... If you do, I want her to bewitch you." The player didn't want that, so we rolled to resolve the bewithing, not the seducing [edit] <i>the seducing was just a given</i> [/edit].<br/><br/>This idea is kinda fundamental to conflict res.<br/><br/>I think an issue of confusion here is players like defining the <i>arena</i> of conflict, but not the conflict itself. Again, if I may bring up tMW, Fates (and I'm talking about the stuff the player actively makes up, not the description on the card) don't define conflict, they define arenas of conflict. So if I narrate that my father has an allegiance with the Witch, that's not defining a conflict, that's saying that I want some sort of father/son conflict. <br/><br/>Are you following me?                        </div>

                            BTW, Shreyas and I were just discussing <i>Otherkind</i> and <i>The World, The Flesh, and the Devil</i> as the prototype Forge-style games. The idea is that your character has all these things that they want, but can't ever achieve all of them.  The character is forced to make 1) hard choices and, better yet, 2) dramatic choices (such as Clinton's trademark glee for face-stabbing).<br/><br/>Ron's stance is interesting, because he's basically saying <i>what the players want is not necessarily what's best for the game</i>.  Sorcerer is not out to build a consensus among the players.  It just tell the players to play their characters to the hilt and let the dice determine outcomes.  I'm clearly trying to get at something else here.  I'm coming from the expectation that the players have a really good chance of knowing what's best for the game, or at least being in the right ballpark, and I want resolution rules that acknowledge that and support that ability instead of acting independently of it.<br/><br/>To answer your question, Brand: For a while, it didn't really matter that we were only running on pure excitement.  Ideas were flowing out of us in unending streams of awesome.  But after a while, all that stuff seemed empty.  What did it matter if we did X, Y, or Z if it was SO EASY?  We didn't want to just be able to go wherever our impulses led us, we wanted to have to fight for what we wanted, even though we all agreed on the eventual outcome.  Everything that happened was flat-out terrific.  But it would have been more fun if there had been mechanical resistance and taken an extra hour to slog through.  Then it would have felt like an accomplishment instead of just a badass daydream.                        </div>

                            Jonathan,<br/><br/>Cool. So let me see if I can get at a part of what you're wanting. You want a system that lets you tell the story you want to tell, coperativly with other players, that still manages to make it difficult for (Players/Characters/both?) to get what they want all the time in order to build a sense that you've earned the story you wanted to tell/story you ended up telling? and that doesn't use resolution based on disagreement between players about what the story should be as the primary mode of resolution and drama formation? <br/><br/>Tell me all the places that I'm wrong, and maybe I'll be able to shoot you back some ideas. (Because, you know, Mo would love a game like that, I'm thinking.)                        </div>

<b>Brand:</b> For me, I get enough surprises from playing with real live people who will suggest stuff that's very different from stuff that I would have thought of on my own.  In play, the surprises can also come, like I said, from the details of how things work out.  Maybe you beat the demon, but you end up owing it your firstborn.  But beating the demon was never in question.<br/><br/><b>Tim:</b> Yes, verily.  But imagine a game where you aways said Yes and there were never any dice rolled, because other players' suggestions were always really badass.  "By all means, she bewitches me ...and eats my soul ...and turns me into a wolf.  Awesome!"  Would a Dogs game without any dice rolled still feel like Dogs?  I kinda doubt it.  I kinda suspect it would be lame.                        </div>

                            Firstly and most importantly, I have to mock Brand for mispelling "our" as "out" not once, but twice.  Haw haw!<br/><br/>Secondly, and to the point, I was thinking about Otherkind as I wrote my prior response, but Otherkind manipulates broad categories of outcomes rather than specific stakes.  Jonathan, is it specific, concrete things that the players/GM are fighting over that you want, or would rolling Otherkind dice and having the GM tell you your guy loses a hand satisfy what you're looking for?<br/><br/>Fan mail isn't the solution to what you want, no, but I think it may be something of a sign post.  One of the bits I was getting at was the division between character effort and player interest, and how they are represented.  Character effort is played out in narration; player interest is played out in the number of cards you take.  If you wanted to heighten that dynamic, you might allow players to even take "negative cards" so they could intentionally screw themselves (and prevent the GM from doing so to prevent the double-reveal problem you propose).<br/><br/>Actually, I have a clarification question, Jonathan: are you looking for all that tension and excitement in the <em>narration</em> and the things that are described happening, or do you want that tension and excitement in the <em>mechanics</em> that control what's happening?  Cause I can't quite see how those things are interrelating in your head.  Do you want a situation where the players are trying hard to 'win' but take losses and turnabouts in the process and they feel "right" to the player's aesthetic sensibilities?                        </div>

                            You nailed it, Brand.  I'm wondering now who (players/characters/both) needs to have a difficult time for it to be fun.  The characters need to face failure and resistance, certainly.  I suppose it's up to individual players whether they consider having their character antagonized to be personal antagonism.  I generally don't, but its the hints of that that makes having your character antagonized fun.  It makes it feel like, you, the player, are actually having to work for the result you want, playing your character skillfully in order to persevere.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe what I'm asking for is a specific kind of Step On Up for this hippy-dippy freeform game.                        </div>

                            Jonathan, <br/><br/>But if you get your surprise from what the others add to the fiction can't that lead to you getting into a position where, if you want their story and they want theirs, that whole "interpersonal conflict" issue raises its head. Or, would you, when confronted with someone doing something surprising to the story that is really not what you thought should happen, let them have it because in so doing they give you the surprise. <br/><br/>In other words, are we back to the whole "I want a game with no way to say "no"" issue?<br/><br/>Because I think there is part of the crux of the issue somewhere around there. If you want resistance then someone, somewhere, has to be able to block or redirect. So if you are getting your surprise from others, maybe you don't want to be able to block them. And if they are getting their surprise from you, maybe they don't want to be able to block you. <br/><br/>So where, then, do we get the ability to make it feel like we aren't all just working together when we actually are? That leads us back to Breaking the Ice or Shadows Over Camelot, and mechanically imposed adversity. But, as you point out, that can lead to the mechanics making both you and I wrong about what the story is going to be about. <br/><br/>As for the players/characters split, that seems like another I/other thing. You, yourself, want to feel invested in the story via the mechanism of the game mechanics making it difficult for you to acheive something in the same way that the rules of the world/story make it difficult for your character to achieve something. So it isn't about what happens to the character, or the story, or even what happens to the game in a real way. It is about what the adversity to you makes you feel vis-a-vis the adversity faced by your charcter/story element. <br/><br/>Which means... I dunno. Are we dealing with a need to make a self-imposed illusion of adversity where there isn't any?                        </div>

<b>JBR:</b> I think I'm looking for that tension both narratively and mechanically.  I feel like the mechanical stuff just reinforces the narrative, basically.  So I can either narrate out my battle with the undead pirate king using some giant pacing mechanic with no real mechanical resolution built in, or mechanical weight can be given to certain aspects of the conflict.<br/><br/>Example:<br/><br/>So, there's the shot-framing system I was working with earlier.  Both players roll d10s of a unique color based on their appropriate traits.  So I have 5 appropriate traits and roll 5 red d10s.  Brand, playing the pirate king, has 7 appropriate traits and rolls 7 blue d10s.  Then we arrange the resulting dice in order, with, let's say, my dice getting priority when they're the same number.<br/><br/>Brand: 2333569<br/>Jonathan: 23690<br/><br/>The result goes: JBJBBBBJBJBJ.<br/><br/>Now we describe each die as an individual "shot" in a movie, narrating my character's fight with the undead pirate king.  I describe the shots related to red dice and Brand describes the ones related to blue dice.  The outcome is already known: I beat the pirate king.  Perhaps we've determined there will be some cost to be determined during the narration.  Perhaps we've already determined what that cost might be.  Perhaps the nature of the cost will be determined by some kind of Fallout system related to how we rolled.<br/><br/>However, the way the scene is now formally paced creates tensions. I mean, Brand has those 4 shots back to back in the middle there, which he can definitely use to wail on my character if he wants or make some big speech about the life of undead pirates.  But, in any case, it stops being, "Okay now my character achieves goal X."  There is now a process that has to be gone through.  Even if the outcome is fixed, the details of the process are not.                        </div>

<b>Brand:</b> I'm suggesting that a general idea of What Happens be determined through freeform consensus building techniques, which include all this Surprising Stuff.  Like I say I defeat the demon, but then Shreyas says "Okay, but the demon should be an expression of your own twisted love for your beautiful cousin and, in defeating the demon, you've broken your own heart."  Because that's the kind of crazy shit Shreyas says.  And that all happens before we even do the scene and is subject to negotiation.  If I say, "Um, Shreyas, that's badass, but not quite what I'm looking for here" then we shelve the idea and someone else comes up with something equally surprising.  <br/><br/>So there's definitely room for Saying No before a scene really gets underway, and maybe that's partially what enables you to get away with Not Saying No during the actual scene.  But, all in all, I don't really see this as a Saying No or Not Saying No issue.  I have strong feelings about that stuff, but I don't think it's what's really going on here.<br/><br/>You can have antagonism without Saying No. That's why you Roll The Dice!  In that way, it's really Say Yes Or Provide Antagonism.  But I'm looking for situations where people want to Say Yes all the time, for the empowerment buzz that provides, but still want the yummy cake of antagonism too.                        </div>

                            Jonathan, <br/><br/>Okay, I am becoming clearer. I hope. <br/><br/>I think that example conflict sounds mighty cool, and the system mighty neat. <br/><br/>But I don't see it adding any real adversity. Its still me losing and you winning. I can say whatever I want to and look as cool as I want in my 4 shots... but if it isn't going to make a difference, it isn't going to make a difference. Its still just illusion of me making it harder when we all know it doesn't, really.  The only way to make there be tension is if in my shots I have a chance to change something you might not want changed. <br/><br/>Dogs style fallout wouldn't even work for that, as you get to chose your own fallout. Of course, if you just twisted that around... You take fallout that I chose? Would that violate the "but we don't want things to turn out in ways we don't want" clause? Because we know how the conflict is going to end, but not how much price will be involved nor what the price is. I get to surprise you with what it is, and we both get to be surprised by how much there is. <br/><br/>Or, even if we set what it was before, we could both be surprised by how much, and perhaps I can have some say over how it comes about? Like we know your wife is going to have an affair before we roll and that the fallout will be that you stop trusting other people. We use the system to shot out how it happens, and I brutalize you with the fact that she actually has an affair with your Circle's Zenith -- and the fallout is massive. Not only does your wife have an affair (not adversity, we knew it was going to happen) but it happens with a friend, and not only does it stop you from trusting people, but it causes problems in your circle too.<br/><br/>Would that work?                        </div>

                            Jonathan, tell me if this is right:<br/><br/>It sounds like you want some parallel conflicts happening.  First, there's the big, obvious "conflict" of whether or not you beat the zombie pirate king.  This is the conflict that everybody knows the result of. The protagonist is going to win.  Then, there's the smaller-scale, more subtle conflicts of <em>how that happens</em>.  This is the conflicts of whether the demon bites off your hand with a lightsaber while having incestuous sex with your sister or... you know, whatever Shreyas says.  Maybe it's as simple as just letting the protagonist-beats-the-big-bad part be assumed, and letting the real conflict be in the how it happens and why it's significant territory?  Like, if you just had a scene structure where you know you're going to play the scene where "protagonist defeats a lieutenant to find the big bad's location."  It's a given that that's going to happen.  The mechanics step in to determine how it happens and why it's significant.<br/><br/>Does that sound anything like what you're interested in, or am I just careening off on a tangent?<br/><br/>Edit: <em>Damn you, Brand!  Give me back the brain!</em> </div>

                            &lt; minirant &gt; "cost" is only one aspect of significance.  The question "What cost are you willing to pay to get what you want?" is also already well addressed by Sorcerer and Dogs.  I'm way more interested in seeing new games that ask "Why do you want what you want?" or "What made you want that?" or "How is what you want not what you need?" and so on.  &lt; / minirant &gt;                        </div>

<p>JBR, lemme try and concretise that...</p>
<p>We know that Mastaba Rascal is going to succeed in stealing the Monkey Jade from the tomb of some dead guy. How is she going to do it?</p>
<p>Maybe Jon says, "Hey, how about MR does like a sexy dance routine in order to avoid the pressure-sensitive traps in the floor, and runs out?" We're all like, sure, that's cool. The system says no! It isn't that easy!</p>
<p>So maybe then Dev says, "The tomb-maze has rearranged itself so you can't take the same path out. You'll have to go through the hall of the sword mummies!"</p>
<p>"Oh snap! Okay. So I go down the hall of the sword mummies and, err...shoot them with my revolvers. The muzzle flares reflect off my sunglasses!" The system says, hmmm, okay, but you can't do it by yourself without taking some serious hurt.</p>
<p>So then maybe Nathan says, "Okay well, how about one of the sword mummies gives you a nasty cut on your arm, and you have to do single-gun shooting?"</p>
<p>Dev says, "Wait hold up, South Dakota Williams is going to come down another hallway and we'll have a cool swirly shot where they are back-to-back against the mummies, all four guns blazing, before they get out." The system says, okay, but this is really important emotionally to Mastaba Raider.</p>
<p>So Jon says, "Okay, so on their way out, MR says to SDW, 'So, you were telling me about your vacation home in Ibiza? I'd like to see it'." Because secretly we've been playing BtI...</p>
<p>Is this something like what you're talking about?</p>

                            Quick suggestion: It's not really about personal cost. It's more about "why does this matter?" or "why do we care?"  Which is why I think it doesn't necessarily matter that the undead pirate king can't change his fate.  He can still change what his fate MEANS by the way in which it occurs.  Does my character kill a heartless monster or a noble hero in his own right?  Does the pirate king's ghost haunt my character for the rest of eternity?  Maybe my character once knew the pirate king in a previous incarnation.  Etc.  Some of these might be considered "costs" but some of them are clearly not.                        </div>

                            Systematizing significance is how I think of it, usually.  And I think it's a worthwhile experiment, if nothing else.  I'm skeptical whether a ruleset can systematize the entire thing without some player interpretation, but if the outputs of the system are not success/failure but significance, meaning, and context, I think that'd be a pretty awesome play experience.                        </div>

                            I don't know if this is systematizing meaning so much as Fruitful Void, kinda.  Like, with the pacing mechanic I posted earlier, the open question is clearly "What does this mean? Why do we care?" But the mechanics don't determine that.  The players do.<br/><br/>Even in Shreyas and JBR's examples, I don't think they're "determining player interpretations of game events" which would seem to be the big scary part of "systematizing meaning," as well as downright impossible.  I think they're just giving different degrees of narrative weight and consequence to different aspects of a conflict.<br/><br/>Shreyas' example sounds a lot like the tomb is playing Mridangam with the players.  I find this amusing.                        </div>

Please don't let me derail it.<br/><br/>JBR: That "almost Capes" game you describe in your first post is the game I'm working on right now. <i>And</i> it has pre-set scene outcomes, like, "This is the scene where the HIVE kidnaps the Professor." It's gonna be hot. Maybe not exactly what Jonathan is looking for here, but still.

                            John, you can join Shreyas and I in <i>constantly designing the same game</i> despite not planning to.  I mean, hell, you already did it with Agon.  I just hope your <i>Titans</i> can be used to play <a href="">Wolfman/Perez stories</a> or Peter David's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Justice" rel="nofollow">Young Justice</a> or Heinsburg/Chung's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Avengers" rel="nofollow">Young Avengers</a> or Vaughan/Whedon's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runaways_%28comics%29" rel="nofollow">Runaways</a> in addition to big-eyed anime craziness.<br/><br/>The shot mechanic does some of the things I want, putting more emphasis on process and allowing the pacing of conflicts without determining outcome randomly or relying on stakes setting. But it's not perfect and I was hoping people had other ideas.  There hasn't been a lot of work in this area, but I suspect there are probably a large variety of possible answers.                        </div>

                            Jonathan, I think this is an incredibly important thread. It's getting at some of the real crux of what RPG play is about.<br/>
<br/>
But it sounds to me like you're asking for a paradox. That is, if you're still not thinking that the pacing mechanic is perfect, I'd understand that, because what's happening is that you're right back to the original problem. It seems to me. To put it into some context, Paul's quote was in relation to the game "Chalk Outlines" in which the player created his own adversity. I think the problem isn't so much that the player creates the adversity as that, in doing so, he can select two options that he wants to see. Meaning that there's no tension.<br/>
<br/>
This is in part because of two things. First, it's because there's nothing to lose. The player is going to get his way A, or his way B. Tension comes from actual player risk. In drama, it comes from not knowing if the protagonist will win or lose in the current effort.<br/>
<br/>
Second, this sort of stake setting is the sort of problem that Ron and I have been saying lately is problematic because it's "playing before you play." That is, you say, "We're going to get to X" and then you head there, get to it, and think, "Well, gee, we really didn't create anything that we didn't create before.<br/>
<br/>
The whole "how do we get there?" or "what's also risked along the way?" can be interesting creatively, but if you make the destination known, you're just filling in blanks, or dodging the main issue.<br/>
<br/>
Basically you're asking to have your cake and eat it too. You want to always get where you want to go, but also have that be a source of tension. I really don't see how that can happen.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sometimes the game tells you that the character failed, when you want to win, or win when you want to fail. And that's a good thing, because it means the tension is real. If there's no real risk to the player about getting to see what they want, then everything else is skirting the issue.<br/>
<br/>
Again, this is a good thing, and what we expect from drama. We want the protagonist to win, but we're OK with the story making him fail, because we know that it's part of the dramatic cycle, and that it'll make the events of the story have more meaning.<br/>
<br/>
This is why Ron says that resolution in these cases are a "Dramatic Springboard." They don't give you what you want. They give you material to work from.<br/>
<br/>
Here's a key fact. Resolution systems don't create theme. At all. Resolution of conflict is about the dramatic tension of surprise. But the dramatic tension that comes from "What will the character decide?" - that comes from the player making decisions for his character. Often ones that lead him into the resolution system.<br/>
<br/>
This is key. Because it's the resolution system that then decides if the character "pays" for what he's decided to do. Sometimes it rewards him, some times it punishes him for what he's decided. Being able to decide that before hand...yeah, that reduces the tension to nothing.<br/>
<br/>
At the risk of people thinking I'm pimping by bringing up my own game, what you have above in terms of a pacing mechanic is quite a lot like Universalis complications, with the solve exception that in Universalis you don't decide before hand what's cool to happen. All the resolution system does is to decide who gets to decide what happens. The players, being the creative sorts you note them to be, then decide on fun stuff, and you're surprised. This was, in fact, the single most surprising thing to myself and Ralph. We thought that if the players were creating their own adversity as a group, and resolving it themselves as a group, that there'd be no surprises. But, since there's more than one person making the action up, in fact, it's always surprising.<br/>
<br/>
The key is to simply put fate into the hands of some other participant than yourself, and to let them make a decision that you may or may not like. The apprehension about the outcome is where the player tension comes from. Because we have methods for ensuring that players are trying to narrate in ways that are pleasing to the other players, the results tend to be ones that we appreciate anyhow. But, until we actually see the results, you have the tension.<br/>
<br/>
I completely agree with you that the idea that it's a conflict between player A's interests, and Player B's interests is bunk. And, yeah, players do want their characters to fail - that may even be their goal in putting their character in a situation where failure may occur. But that's not the same thing as saying that players want to know what's going to happen to their characters before hand.<br/>
<br/>
I think the essential act of RPG play is in coming up with the result of the current action on the spot. What does my character do? What happens when my character is in danger? I recall one design long ago, well thought out (can't remember the designer), but where the idea was that you created the entire storyline up front, and then just went through the paces of filling in the "how did we get from scene one to scene two." And I recall my ideas being somewhat incohate at the time on the subject, but protesting that I knew that playing the game would blow. Because I don't want to know what's going to happen next.<br/>
<br/>
Now, is there some activity that's essentially collaborative fiction writing? Yeah, and I suppose some might like it. But it's not a RPG, or at least not what I signed up for at the door.<br/>
<br/>
And, I'd hazard from what you've said, not what you signed up for either.<br/>
<br/>
I think that if you want to give players the power to create the interesting things that they come up with, that this is trivial to do - there are lots of systems that simply do it by saying "You're turn to narrate now." Take the Pool, for instance. We don't give the right to narrate to the player one moment, and to the GM the next, because there's some tension to be found in conflicts of interest between those players, but simply so that we're not always resolving our own action, and, more importantly, because we don't know who will resolve the action. So we don't know what'll happen.<br/>
<br/>
Seems really simple to me on that level. But you guys have debated this pretty deeply above. So I'm willing to accept that maybe I'm not seeing some element of the debate. If so, let me know where I've gone wrong.<br/>

                            Mike, <br><br>Basic point where I'd say you've gone... not wrong, but different is the one where tension in drama comes from not knowing if the protagonist will win or lose. <br><br>If you mean "win or lose in this exact minute" then, yea, maybe. If you mean overall, then not so much. <br><br>When you watch, I dunno... Buffy, you normally have a pretty good sense if Buffy is going to win or lose an individual fight. You also know that Buffy is going to win most of her conflicts by the end of the episode. The drama really isn't about if she's going to win or lose, its about what its going to cost her and what cool stuff happens along the way. (Notably the 6th and 7th seasons switched up this formula, and in so doing created a lot of fan ire.) <br><br>Now, that exact formula is the reason that lots of folks don't like Buffy. But its also the reason a lot of folks do. <br><br>So when we get to: <br><br>"But it's not a RPG, or at least not what I signed up for at the door. "<br><br>I'll have to say the second part is true, and valuable, and well worth discussing. The first part is bullshit. <br><br>So long as we have "this is an RPG" where "RPG" is defined as being only what one group signed up for at the door we're never going to get out of the hole we've been digging ourselves into since the early 70s. I mean really Mike, this is the exact same argument, word for word, that folks on RPG.net and other sites use to say that Sorcerer or Universalis aren't "RPGS." <br><br>So, lets kick that part to the curb but good, okay? <br><br>However, now that I've had my rant, I do think there is a degree to which what we've been looking at in this thread is having your cake and eating it too -- at least in the ways in which we're defining opposition and adversity. The fact that we're often defining them together is a problem, and I still don't know that we've gotten the "zones" where they need to happen for different creative purpouses down yet. But in as much as we want to be able to create together freely and at the same time want to have the feeling that we've created something that has value from being earned by overcoming opposition... yea, that's a paradox. <br><br>Thus the reasons I was trying to step around the shot mechanic in order to make the fact that I had some actions mean something in the context of the conflict. If we're already headed down the road towards the pirate king losing then we're into Buffy land. We know what's going to happen in terms of who wins the fight -- but how is it going to affect/effect Buffy? How much is she going to have to pay? What is she going to learn about herself? And thus my thoughts about the fallout system where you roll for fallout after and the other player assigns fallout. <br><br>Because in that system, as in Buffy, the shot system isn't resolution -- it's structure. The resolution isn't about who wins or loses, its about what that win or loss costs.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Okay, I don't want to dwell on the shot system if it's not that exciting to people, but I think, Mike, that it does the same thing as Universalis.  It determines who narrates, but in a more complex way, not "you narrate the results of this conflict" but a back-and-forth pattern of freely narrating shots.  What does my char have to go through to defeat the pirate king?  Well, that's partially up to Brand to decide.  Actually, you could argue that more if it is up to Brand to decide because he has 7 shots to my 5.  There's plenty of room for surprises and extra costs in there, but it's partially a reaction to my feeling that outcomes should also be partially negotiated and not arbitrarily left up entirely to one person.  Here, the outcome is still arbitrary, but negotiated.<br><br>Also, I tend to agree with Brand.  Watching a lot of good movies or TV, you can anticipate how a scene's going to end, or at least the general character of it, right as it starts.  Char A walks into a room with Char B, her ex-boyfriend.  Boom, you can probably guess that things are not going to be good and you can use the things you know about the characters to guess some of the issues that might get brought up in the scene.  Genre conventions help in this too.  You're not watching for the outcome, which is largely predetermined, you're watching for the details, the little surprises.  You're watching largely <i>to see what you know is going to happen actually happen</i>.  It's that love of familiarity and predictability.  We wanna see Buffy acting like Buffy or Spike acting like Spike.  It makes us go "Oh, Buffy, why are you so X?" and giggle to ourselves.<br><br>I don't know, though, if discussing things in this abstract way is really going to get us anywhere, though I agree these issues are really important.  Perhaps I'll try to do some actual play on IRC over the holiday weekend and post a transcript here.  Because I wonder if we're really disagreeing or just talking past each other.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Brand, sorry that my throwaway comment was something that irritates you. In point of fact, however, I agree with the people who say that Universalis is not a RPG. I may have been the first person to say it, in fact.<br/>
<br/>
But, in any case, it's the latter point that's important. I don't think it's fun to know what's coming.<br/>
<br/>
And that includes Buffy.<br/>
<br/>
That is, yes, it's extremely unlikely that Buffy is going to die in this scene. But she loses fights all the time. You're doing the classic RPG dichotomy, and making all loss be about death. As long as there's anything that might be lost, then there's tension. But here's the key. We don't know that her life is, or is not at stake. Nor even precisely what's at stake.<br/>
<br/>
This is what Ron and I have been on about for a while now. Even pre-defining stake dichotomies takes some of the tension out. Because you know what the two outcomes might be now. If you go into a conflict, and some other player gets to decide on the end what the stakes are, and what's lost... that's the fun part. So we get into a fight, with the character intent to kill each other. Let's NOT state what we as players want. The other participants have an idea of what would be cool. Let's instead let them decide on which of these to deal with as a creative part of the output of resolution. Let's not constrain ourselves to only certain outcomes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Jonathan, in Universalis each player who participated in the conflict - and it could be everyone at the table - gets a turn to narrate the outcome of a complication, and the size of his turn is based on the Coins he got from it. So, no, it doesn't do "back and forth" but it does determine an order, and it does determine a magnitude to the order. Your system is somewhat superior to this, I admit. I was only pointing out that the main difference is that, despite the fact that what triggers a Complication is a stated desire for one thing to change another (without taking it over), you don't have to precisely state what sort of change is being created. Sure, players often say, "I want my component to kill your component." But what's interesting is that, when all is said and done, they often don't do that with their winnings. Nor do the rules require them to do so in any way (only that the outcome should be challenged if it doesn't somehow flow from the described previous action).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let me put this another way. Let's say we use your system as you have it written, except that we don't pre-arrange the outcome. Is this inferior in your opinion? If so, why?<br/>
<br/>
Let me play Sorensen-esqe provocateur here for a moment. I posit that explicit pre-setting of stakes or scene outcomes is a reaction to RPG play where the GM railroads the outcome (particularly discovered illusionist play). That is, players, worried that their agency will be taken away, and, worse, that the GM or some other participant will make their character look bad or otherwise "deprotagonize" the character (to use the Czegism), these sorts of players want to be assured that the outcome of a contest can only have one, or one of a few, acceptable outcomes.<br/>
<br/>
To go back to Fred's recent diagram, they may be worried that their intent is being ignored, or, worse, intentionally misidentified, so that somebody else can control the game.<br/>
<br/>
Well, the fact is that we all agree that other players are capable of creating outcomes that we enjoy. Right? In fact, your whole idea is predicated on this notion, that it's not correct that we disagree with other's ideas for what should happen to our characters or the story. On the contrary, we like their ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Well, if that's so, then why not allow for some other player to create the outcome at the moment it happens? I mean even if the tension isn't thick about it, why not? That's not to say that I'm against giving tools to the players so that they understand what the other players would like to see as outcomes. We do a lot of work on that with ideas like Flags. And mechanics that support this stuff like what MLWM does. I'd even argue that simply HQ resolution requiring "Goals" (as opposed to "Stakes") does this.<br/>
<br/>
So, given players who want to make stuff that you'll think is cool, and tools that enable them to do so...why not let them do it in the sequence that the events happen? Again, look at The Pool. It doesn't tell you who won, just who gets to narrate. So, going into the conflict, you don't know if you're going to narrate, or the GM. So you don't know what's going to happen, because it might not be you.<br/>
<br/>

<b>Paul:</b> Interesting idea, let me think about it.<br><br><b>Mike:</b> Yeah, I see where you're going with this and I dig it.  Maybe having a predetermined outcome really is just a reaction to playing with people who may not work well together, which is not really my target audience.  Maybe a general declaration of intent or the general idea of the scene (Saadi tries to ask Radiance on a date!) is enough.<br><br>One other idea just struck me, though it may not be right for this project.  What if consequences (Fallout, in Dogs terms) was handed out by the other players like Fanmail?  That is to say, what if there was a pacing mechanic that structured the narration of a conflict, but it was up to the other players to judge the significance of various actions and where the Fallout falls.  In this way, you're basically Stunting (in Exalted terms) to impress the other players so they'll make your actions meaningful to the overall narrative.  Sort of like Engels Matrix, but with the other players determining the potency instead of a GM.<br><br>Example: Near the end of our duel, Brand narrates a shot where my character stumbles backwards and falls into the hold of the ghost ship.  Shreyas says "Ouch!" and gives me a Fallout die to roll later.  I narrate a shot of my character falling into the gaping maw of an undead crocodile monster they keep in the hold.  Everybody at the table squeals, and I get passed another 3 Fallout dice.  Nathan, who's grinning evily in the corner, gives a Fallout die to the undead crocodile monster (who didn't exist before the last shot).  When we look at him questioningly, he says, "What? You're not very easy to digest!"<br><br>Voila, a sketchy, socially-determined physical/social/mental damage system!  Maybe something like that would allow the events of the conflict to be determined by the players during the scene, as well as the degree of meaning, but because these are determined by different players, there's still tension?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Sure. Again, tension is not about win/lose. It's about just not knowing what's going to happen in terms of meaningful outcome.<br/>
<br/>
Put another way, if your original system above is simply saying that we really don't care about whether or not the pirate gets beat, but only what happens along the way, then the conflict is not about beating the pirate. It's just hard to imagine that beating the pirate isn't an interesting question, or that failing wouldn't be potentially cool, too. But if that's what the system is about, that's just player framing a good conflict.<br/>
<br/>
I was going to say this before, but thought it might confuse things to present this alternate side of things.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, I'm of the belief that, with good enough mechanics, that a game can provide good results sans pre-determination of outcomes, even with players who don't play along well together. The easiest example is D&amp;D. In D&amp;D we don't know who's going to win when we start. And yet the system produces expected results that, even when failures, are generally acceptable to the players.<br/>
<br/>
What happens is that people start trying to play wanting player control of story with a system like D&amp;D, and then, predictably, the results provided by the system aren't good ones for that style. Often the response to this is illusionism. The response to illusionism can be that you have to have a system where you pre-plan the outcomes so that they're sure to be good ones. When you don't have to at all. All you need is a system that allows players the appropriate control of the outcome, instead of the system incentivizing something else, or informing the GM that he should do something else. And you get good outcomes.<br/>

                            Jonathan: Your group-given Fallout sounds really nifty to me. As someone who loves to throw his character to the wolves, I would enjoy it, I think. And it fits well with your shots system. Definitely worth trying.                        </div>
