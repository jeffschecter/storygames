How'd it go? Besides amazing.</blockquote>\nNot that I'm Paul, but...I played in both games, as Erkki &amp; Manauo (I think I'm misspelling it -- I Anglicized the names to Eric and Manuel). It was interesting to see different takes on the characters.<br/><br/>I think that playing in The Upgrade! both times was my third favorite thing about the con. It was the right crowd of folks, all of whom were interested in "this Scandinavian thing," so I think the games fired off wicked well. In both games, we only had three of the couples playing. In the first, we also had a co-host, which worked awesome. I'd be happy to unpack more of my thoughts on the games, though at the moment I'm still pretty exhausted from the con.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127748/#Comment_127748" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T13:56:15+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  1:56PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Short version, until my brain uncompresses:<br/><br/>Friday night's game was insanity, with the ultra-bizarre Swedish couple on the American version of the show. Tom Donally's Maunu provided the two most memorable moments of the game, with his twisted yet ultimately effecting story of how his father killed his mother and hid the body under the bed for eight year, and with providing the quote of the con: "Your wife, she 69s like a horse!" Jim did an awesome job as the conscripted co-host; I was incredibly pleased when I was able to take a breather and just let him (and the rest of the players) run the show for a few minutes.<br/><br/>Saturday's game was lower-key and more introspective, which made it awesome in it's own right. There was less playing with the past, more "innermost thoughts," and more overt direction on my part. I felt like I understood and cared about the characters in this one. And they all chose to Upgrade!<br/><br/>--Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127759/#Comment_127759" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T14:11:38+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  2:11PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was really unsure about doing this.  I had never done any sort of LARPing before.  I never had any interest in it.  Also, I had the impression things would go in a direction that was out of my comfort zone.  But, I knew there was a lot of interest and people who I know are fun to play with would be signing up. I made the decision to try something new and committed to giving 100% regardless of whether or not I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>I'm really glad I decided to participate.  I had so much fun.  I played Anteo (renamed Tony).  Tony was somewhat reluctant to go on the Upgrade so I expressed a little of my real reluctance through that.  As I became more comfortable and realized this was lots of fun so did Tony.<br/><br/>I had a lot more time in the spotlight than I normally do.  I'm a quiet and reserved person and that tends to get projected into my play.  I'm more of a wait for my turn kind of guy than a jump on in type.  Well it was my turn a lot more often then I was used to.  I think I dealt with increased spotlight time well.  I even jumped up a few times to add monologue or other bits.

We call them 'Huge' and 'Huger'."<br/><br/>I have to admit, I was going to let the "West Coast Premier!" of Jeep Form slide by me, watch how it played out rather then play it out myself.  I'm not really a bleeding edge kind of player.  I prefer tinkering with the established, I don't enjoy putting my hard hat on.<br/><br/>And yet somehow I found myself on the receiving end of Paul's big pleading eyes and cock-sure "you know you wanna" grin when he was looking for more women to play his Friday night Upgrade! game.  I'm really, really glad I did... though I don't know if I'll ever really be able to look at Swedish Men quite the same way again.<br/><br/>To me, my biggest problem reading about "Yeepform" was that I simply couldn't wrap my head around the concept of structured free form.  To me, it sounded like that old "Military Intelligence" joke.  How is it free if it's structured, and how can it be structured if it's free?  For me, as a self acknowledged and well established kinetic learner, I just had to see it to believe it.<br/><br/>The idea of taking on specific roles, and then playing within the confines of only loosely structured scenes threw me right back into the third grade.  This is EXACTLY what I did on the playground with my school friends when we'd play Transformers or MLP or Voltron or whatever other pop culture phenomenon had captured our 8-9 year old brains.  It's why I joined the Drama club.  It drew me to gaming.  It's why I MUSHed.  It's why I LARP.  Jeepform is like all of those great things distilled back to that pure creative enjoyment I experienced as a kid.  I could have watched Ryan and Nancy's story all night long, happily being a supporting role.  I could have laughed at Tom and Holly's antics until I wheezed for breath (oh wait, I did).  And CK and I... we were so trapped by our own concepts of "modern traditions" that I feel like "Mark" and "Pavi" really came away as completely different people to who they'd been when coming onto the 'show', and yet (at least for Pavi) still had NO idea who she was.  And all of that was completely satisfying.<br/><br/>I am now combing the Jeepform website.  I'm researching how one structures a Jeepform game if one wished to write one.<br/><br/>Thanks for thinking of me, Paul.  You did me a world of good. : D                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127795/#Comment_127795" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T15:39:21+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  3:39PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>Had the core situation been a bit more grabby for me I would have given it a spin.</blockquote>\nThe core situation of The Upgrade! is a fruitful void, at least with respect to relationship issues, a lack of privacy, a feeling of being constantly "on" and a sense of manipulation.

And what Laura said about it being like the pretend we did as kids rings true for me too.* It feels natural and intuitive to me, slipping from scene to scene and framing past present etc.  I've seen others completely new to it have this response too.

The Friday group was a lot like ours, Jason: They jumped all over the three time-spaces and didn't do particularly much bird-in-ear (monologue). The Saturday group, on the other hand, was the opposite. We saw relatively little of the past and future from them, but we got a lot of their innermost thoughts.

He clearly stepped away from the person he was speaking with, but didn't do the "put your hand to your head to show you're being semi-meta".<br/><br/>Since Ryan played "Mauno" in the Saturday game, he knew the Big Reveal: that Manny was a plant.<br/><br/>We concluded Tom was breaking the 4th wall to the camera, and that he did a hell of a job at it, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tom%20Donnelly" title="Tom Donnelly"><img alt="Tom Donnelly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tom%20Donnelly">Tom Donnelly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128185/#Comment_128185" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T16:42:03+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  4:42PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suppose it is time for Manny to speak. The Upgrade was awesome. We had 8 with Paul and everyone brought so much energy, creativity, and balls...literally...to the party. <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly and I made the choice to be Swedish superfans of the show, joining the American version and very chagrined to discover that the American version was just so bourgeois and boring, and they clearly did not supply anyone with enough lube. "She 69s like a Horse." "We call them Huge and Huger." "Anyone in the mood for a club sandwich..." all  Manny quotes. So it should be clear I played Manny as less of a conniver and more of a...Swedish sex addict. Competitive, sure. Sneaky, maybe. But deep down very sweet and innocent. Which led to my breaking the 4th wall with a tale of classic Swedish tragedy whereby Manny's superficialities were revealed to be a protection mechanism brought about by his mother's murder at his father's hand. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat moment was very fulfilling for me, since Manny up to that point was largely a clown, and I'm not sure anyone saw the turn towards depth coming. <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly's Reina matched Manny blow for blow...also literally, but revealed no deeper levels, which I LOVE as a choice. Why not play the opposite of the trend? So she was pretty much the trampiest girl in Oslo (and secretly Manny's stepsister). <br/>\n<br/>\nRyan and Nancy were very touching in the gentility and meekness they brought to their roles of the couple that probably shouldn't be there. Nancy's milkmaid was constantly flustered when she was paired with Manny, but ended up finding romantic possibilities with CK during an awesome skinnydipping scene. And Ryan? Well, Ryan's best chance at an upgrade it turned out was with Timmy the wardrobe boy. <br/>\n<br/>\nCK and Laura were equally fantastich, playing a couple truly struggling with where they were going in life. Contemplating both having children, and breaking up. Very nuanced play, except when Laura would go on another laughing jag, which was all the time. CK's terrible golfing accident was a wonder to behold, as was Laura's bungie jumping mishap. Truly they were the unluckiest couple in Upgrade history. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd last but certainly not least were our cohosts: Paul and Jim. These guys ping ponged off each other as though they had been doing the show for years. I saw several looks of shock on Paul's face as he and Jim nearly instantly found this rhythm and chemistry between them as they took us to commercial breaks for "The Jack Daniels, Hawaiian Tropic, Trojans Upgrade." (actually, that isn't exactly right) The idea there was that whenever we would use a product on the show, the next time the hosts spoke, they suddenly were "before the title" sponsors. Hilarious. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as jeepform technique, I was surprised how much of it we included.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a lot of playing in the past, often for comic gotchas, but also for some tender moments explaining the present difficulties. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a lot of possible futures as well, including at least 4 involving coitus. We had at least one dueling possible future as well (two different possibilities enacted in a row).<br/>\n<br/>\nA few bird-in-the-ears, if my breaking the fourth wall and other similar moments count. Very powerful technique. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure if we ever played the same present scene again from a different perspective, but in retrospect there were so many opportunities for that: nude bungie jumping, Ryan's bi-dabbling, the Club Sandwich (if a threesome is a sandwich, what is a foursome?).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe introduced several supporting characters including cameramen, a director, and of course Timmy the wardrobe boy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had two large producer scenes where we went over suggestions for improving The Upgrade. Jim and Paul blew me away with their producer personas in these.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had several interview scenes, many of them intentionally punitive, including the revelation of Manny's infertility. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe played a bit with behind the scenes moments, but not too much.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd lastly, we had a few moments cutting to the audience watching the episode. Laura almost had me doing a spit take with her audience reaction to CK's maiming. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end, nobody chose to upgrade, realizing that perhaps while the grass is greener elsewhere, penicillin can only cure so many things.<br/>\n<br/>\nA wonderful event. Congrats and thanks to Paul for arranging it. He will not be at the next Strategicon, and so I may volunteer to run the Upgrade at least one more time there to spread the wacky jeepform goodness. <br/>\n<br/>\nI will leave you with a few choice answers to the "couples questionnaire" for Manny and Reina:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is the best thing about your relationship?<br/>\nReina: Manny's beautiful blue eyes.<br/>\nManny: I have to say...the anal. Yah. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat did you do on your first date?<br/>\nReina: Fucked.<br/>\nManny: Yah, but not all the time. Just for three days or so. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you usually do on Sunday mornings? <br/>\nReina: Ah, on Sunday mornings? We fuck. We save missionary position for Sundays. <br/>\nManny: Yah...although I do enjoy a good sudoku as well. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\n<br/>\nTom                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128784/#Comment_128784" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T15:06:53+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  3:06PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2008 3:07PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tom Donnelly</cite>Ryan and Nancy were very touching in the gentility and meekness they brought to their roles of the couple that probably shouldn't be there.

Someone said "what about that scene with him being gay," and there it was.  I didn't block -- hell, I started to build on that a touch as a producer.  But in playing the character, I was really unprepared for that -- it knocked the character out some for me.  Not that I didn't have fun, but that I didn't know *how* to approach that.  So, having two bottles of Wild Turkey and telling the cameraman he's beautiful was my "It's a cougar!" moment -- something so just over the top that I hoped it would save me from floundering in the scene.<br/><br/>What I really loved most of all what his different mine &amp; Nancy's Eric/Ritva were compared to Ted &amp; Meghann's, and how different mine &amp; Sarah's Manuel(Manny) &amp; Katie(Reina) were compared to Tom &amp; Holly's.  You read Tom's questionnaire above.  Here's a bit of how mine &amp; Sarah's went for the same characters:<br/><br/>Me: Okay, so, kids.<br/>Her:  No!<br/>Me:  Wait, hang on.  What if we had a dead kid.  That plays up the sympathy vote.<br/>Her:  It's got to be your kid, not mine.<br/>Me:  Right, right.  You're right.  Hmm...um...wait, isn't one of the producer's named Paul?  That's my son's name.  So, how did he die...<br/><br/>etc.  We were total plants, to where we started by mocking the other couple while they were filling out their questionnaires, talking about how we'd totally own them.<br/><br/>And, for Manuel, everyone could tell early on that he was a plant -- he was a shitty actor.  I loved that, I loved trying to be slick and failing.  It made for a different character than Tom's party-Swede.  At one point, I threatened Eric's life, and everyone was cagey around me.  The poignant moment at the end of the night was, for Manuel, meeting up with Katie in the bar and telling her to follow her heart, not a promise she made.  I remember a bit of grinning from the others at the "I'm a soulless fuck" line.  With that bit of humanity, the character dramatically changed -- in some respects, similar to how Manny got more depth with his "reveal."<br/><br/><em>Where I think I can definitely improve:</em>  As a jeepform player, I tried to keep myself in reactive moments.  I was uncomfortable being proactive, as a character.  As a player, I was comfortable being proactive with other people's characters -- with the past and the possible future.  Still, it was rough, but a damned good rough.  I enjoyed playing both times.<br/><br/>As a point of amusement, Nancy's character and my character ended up with each other in both OrcCon games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tom%20Donnelly" title="Tom Donnelly"><img alt="Tom Donnelly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tom%20Donnelly">Tom Donnelly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128904/#Comment_128904" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T20:59:30+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  8:59PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's right, I forgot the bisexuality thing came from the producer round table.
