Right up until the last minute it looked like it was going to be very slow and very poorly attended.  I could not have been more wrong.<br/><br/>This was the first con in a long while where RPGs did not have private rooms.  Instead there were three large RPG rooms with about six tables in each.  I\u2019m an indie-RPG evangelical exhibitionist so I was actually pretty okay and even a little excited about this.  However, I quickly realized why this might be a bummer for some as I watched Colin GM his Spirit of the Force game with the physical showmanship of someone who must have been a carnival barker in a former life.  I found myself wonder if he actually rehearsed in front of a mirror.  I was assured later that he does not. <br/><br/>Saturday morning Laura, Vasco and I started to setup a \u201cShooting the Moon\u201d game but were interrupted by a vicious allergy attack.  I was still glad to at least finally see the setup process and the first scene of this game in action.  I\u2019ve kept the notes so perhaps the three of us could catch up at a later date to finish the game.<br/><br/>Saturday afternoon I ran a game of \u201cOne Can Have Her.\u201d  This game is underplayed and under hyped.  It\u2019s very much a less-is-more design with just a few key features to really drive home the game\u2019s premise.  It\u2019s easy to dismiss the game from its text as it plays much better than it reads.  It was also the second time I\u2019d run the game and I was glad that to see that the setup procedures really do shape different kinds of Femme Fatales.  The first time I ran it the Femme Fatale was very much the dreamer-girl hoping for her white knight.  This time the Femme Fatale was a much more self-assured woman willing to do anything to find justice for her murdered little brother.<br/><br/>Saturday evening I ran \u201cDirty Secrets.\u201d  And this group now holds the record for completing a Novella in just three hours.  Although we had the advantage of playing with Will who has played the game with me before and when he could he drove the Witness up the center of the grid thus creating more opportunities to box it in.  The three other players had never played the game before, I believe this was the first indie-game for two of them, and at least one of those seemed fairly committed to buying the game afterwards.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this game as I think it touched on the opportunities for social commentary about \u201cyour home town, last week.\u201d  Will, as the investigator, played an older LAPD officer.  In the very first conflict of the game he had all his dice wiped out and thus was IMMEDIATELY forced into a Reflection scene.  Since the conflict had been about chasing down a suspect the Reflection scene was all about how the old cop feels like he\u2019s losing his edge which totally set the tone for the rest of the game.  Ultimately we had a story about an old cop dealing with the changing social and political environment in L.A.  The game even touched on some racial issues so endemic to Los Angeles.<br/><br/>This game really made me want to try tackling a Novel with the system.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146175/#Comment_146175" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T10:13:01+00:00" title="May 27, 2008 10:13AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sunday morning Will, Colin, Laura and I met in one of the quieter secluded pool side rooms for the middle session of our already in progress Grey Ranks game.  It was weird to see those old pool rooms since those used to be the RPG rooms back in the day.  I hadn\u2019t walked that walkway since I was about 15; a fitting local perhaps for me to be playing a game about teenagers.<br/><br/>During this game I delivered an off-the-cuff speech about my character\u2019s sister (the Thing He Holds Dear) and her unshakable faith in God to Laura\u2019s character.  For about two seconds I honestly thought I was going to make her cry.  I\u2019m also really enjoying the rivalry between my character and Colin\u2019s character over the role girls should be playing in missions.  And Will\u2019s character\u2019s discovery that there\u2019s more in killing a man than simple duty and patriotism is frightening, fascinating and just a bit hopeful.<br/><br/>Sunday afternoon I ran a game of In A Wicked Age\u2026  We actually managed to squeeze in two whole Chapters.  The second Chapter was a bit weak in my opinion compared to the awesome that was the first but I think that\u2019s to be expected when you creatively push yourself like that.  I pretty much run the dice mechanics like I do the dice mechanics of Sorcerer and the thing runs like a dream.  In A Wicked Age\u2026 really is the only Swords and Sorcery RPG I would run outside of Sorcerer &amp; Sword.  I had great fun playing a tyrannical Warlord NPC with a howling suit of bone armor as his Particular Strength.<br/><br/>After that, it was time to head out.<br/><br/>Other notable things included my friend Amy who I\u2019ve been encouraging to come to the con for a couple of years now finally showed up.  I hope she got at least a couple good games in and will continue to come.  Also James poked a bit of fun at me for my thread here about Aspects in SotC and said he wanted to watch my \u201cMasochistic Spirit of the Century\u201d game.  This got me thinking about \u201cSpirit of the 18th Century\u201d a game of torrid gothic romance.   So perhaps next con\u2026<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146224/#Comment_146224" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T12:58:53+00:00" title="May 27, 2008 12:58PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>It was weird to see those old pool rooms since those used to be the RPG rooms back in the day. </blockquote>\nTo be clear, they were overfill back in the day.

I played something each evening, and got to evangelize a lot of indie and story games to folks in the vendor hall.<br/><br/>On Friday afternoon, we were playing Carcassone to kill time before the bar opened and picked up a random guy looking for something to play.  When the game was over, we invited him along to the NerdSoCal Meetup in the bar.  At the Meetup, everybody who had signed up for <em>In a Wicked Age</em> happened to be there, plus more who wanted to play, so I offered to run a second game and our Carcassone-playing new friend joined in.  In the subsequent game (which involved a ghost dog seeking justice against the prince who killed him), we got him hooked.  His first indie/story game, and we threw him into the deep end with IAWA.  He loved it.  I think he went on to play SotC and Inspectres, both twice, that con.<br/><br/>On Saturday, after our very good sales day at the booth, I played in Judson's Mobster LARP, which was a new experience for me -- the new experience being a LARP that didn't suck.  With twelve players, three factions, and three "independents," there was all sorts of things happening throughout, with a lot of shifting ground and entertaining wheeling and dealing.<br/><br/>Sunday night found me pretty wiped at 8 o'clock.  There were a lot of hopeful alternates for Colin's Spirit of the Force game, which was quite full.  The lot of us regrouped after being <em>cruelly rebuffed</em> (Colin making the silly claim that he couldn't GM for ten Jedi at the same time or somesuch nonsense).  Folks wanted to play something but I was nearly blithering.  Someone suggested Inspectres, and I realized that, while I really was not sufficiently together to play anything, I could totally <em>run</em> Inspectres.  So we fought off a building full of tentacles and a noise-polluting coven of witches.  I entertained myself by interspersing the players' success dice with incisive stuff like, "There's a strange yellow gas coming out of the vent," and then they'd tell me what it was.<br/><br/>On Monday after the booth closed, a few of us got together to play the second installment of our unWritten game, in which the awesome was unleashed despite our fatigue.  There was treachery, sorcery, and dragons, and all sorts of other fun.<br/><br/>Of particular note, the IPR booth was across the way from Seth's Games and Anime, and Seth brought his 7-month-old daughter to the con. So there was baby-oggling and baby-holding and playing with babies and that may have been the best part of the con, even above and beyond the awesome gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mcellis" title="mcellis"><img alt="mcellis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mcellis">mcellis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146286/#Comment_146286" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T18:15:56+00:00" title="May 27, 2008  6:15PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My Gamex vacation was rocking despite the few missing faces and the lack of their games, and the new RPG room layout. Which wasn't too bad for the noise, but was bad for the funk.<br/>\n<br/>\nDelta Green classic Cthulhu was solid though we did get a little sidetracked with the little monster in the beginning rather than going after the big elder god being milked in a basement like we were supposed to.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter picking up a few interesting finds in the dealers room I ran my first Spirit of the Shattered Earth game which rocked. The national monument picked for the start of the game was the St Louis Arch. On the coast of the inland sea. The situation the players decided on was Mutant Cannibal Raiders with Yet another Evil Sorcerer! So in an orgy of over the top post apocalyptic goodness the vile mutant Boar General Napoleon, his legion of cannibal pigmen soldiers and his scarred and sultry ally the Fire Witch were defeated at a second battle of Waterloo.<br/>\n<br/>\nI 'ran' InSpectres Lackawanna and a the souls of the melanin of a thousand albinos found freedom from their tanning bed prisons. And Vampire Cow Bats were warded away from Amish country by the cunning use of a Pope blessed Cowbell.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Ray Harryhausen Sinbad/Slayer game was full of fantastic stop motion monster busting. From a winged Homunculus, to two-headed Sea Serpents, to the grand showdown versus the wicked Vizier, his Djinn and a giant Mechanical Manticore.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second Spirit of the Shattered Earth rocked on toast. The monument was the long cracked Hoover Dam and the menace was Vegan Raiders again they were Cannibals. Nero the Emperor of the Vegas Strip and his legions of lizard men had stolen Hooville's power converter so a short Zeppelin ride and a hang-gliding night assault later the PCs were in Vegas. Raiding the Luxor for power converters, freeing White Slave Tigresses, and hitching a ride in a Sherman Tank, a Mini Van, and Elvis' Pink Cadillac. While Bunker the Boy of the Apocalypse, and his robot gunslinging guardian Tex cowed Caesar's legion into believing that Vegas needed a New King. And who shows up but Bengal the King of the Black Top Jungle driving the King's Car! It was full of win.<br/>\n<br/>\nI finished up the con with a Spirit of the Force game that was as always crazy awesome. Our former master was defeated and cast into the heart of dying gas giant from it's broken frozen crust. My reckless Jedi hero following his master and his doomed love into the swirling turmoil of gas at the heart of the planet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/alejandro" title="alejandro"><img alt="alejandro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/alejandro">alejandro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146332/#Comment_146332" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T23:59:38+00:00" title="May 27, 2008 11:59PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I as well missed some faces, however, I had a blast! <br/><br/>I was able to run 3 playtests of unWritten, which turned out great.

Each game was totally different and it was neat to see what different players did with the same half gens and what Aspects they wrote in. In the end, one group redeemed their fallen Jedi Master just before he died at his newly fallen son's hand, one group killed him and sparked a bloodbath between the players who fell and those trying to remain in the light, and the last group the player who killed the master sacrificed his life in the process and found redemption, leaving the others to deal with their own hate and dark side issues. In all of them one of the players ended the game taking up their fallen masters mantle and joined the Sith. Big fun.<br/><br/>I also ran the Don't Rest Your Head midnight game, using Ryan Macklin's Bad Man Scenario. In which children deal with the boogie man, and much fun was had. It was definately a lighter game than I normally run and the players basically escaped unscathed.... One fell asleep and became a monster  (I love when pain dominates on the roll that crashes a player, they get to narrate their awesome end and then I get to twist it), 2 found what they were looking for and stayed in the Mad City, and the last broke under the madness and killed his folks. Ok not sooo light... but there were magic pokemon cards, Iron Man-esque wheel chair mechs, Hulk pajamas and a real working lightsaber... so there.<br/><br/>Play wise I got to play SotC for the 3rd time - go me, in Morgan\u2019s really fun Shattered Earth setting in which I was the "Motor City Kitty" Bangal the "Savage Beastman" "Road Ranger", and we kicked Napoleon's Mutant War Pig Army's ass at the 2nd battle of Waterloo.
